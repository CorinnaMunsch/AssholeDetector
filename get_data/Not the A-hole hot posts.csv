0,Not the A-hole,"AITA for backing out of being a bridesmaid for my friend rather than take off my hijab, even after the other bridesmaids bought modest dresses to accommodate me?",9765,m1kmnt,1246,"We have been friends for 5 years, and in the whole time she's known me I've never taken my hijab off around men from outside my family. I have taken it off in front of her before, but only because I was only around women, and she knew this was the case. When we were trying on bridesmaid dresses, I offered to wear a different dress to the other bridesmaids or wear a covering over the dress so they didn't all have to conform to my needs regarding the modesty of the dress. We settled on all wearing a dress that I could wear, as the bride wanted us to match. I was happy that they accommodated me, and none of them seemed to mind wearing a more modest dress than they might have worn otherwise. Yesterday I asked the bride if she wanted me to wear a scarf that matched the dress or of a different colour. She was startled and told me she was expecting me not to wear a hijab, because when she said she wanted us all to match she thought I understood she meant not just the dresses, but that I would not be wearing a hijab. She also said that she thought I would be ok with it since I took my hijab off while trying on dresses, which I only did because I was only around women and I was trying on some dresses that go over the head so I felt the hijab would have fallen off anyway.I said that if I could not wear a hijab as a bridesmaid, I would not be able to be a bridesmaid. My friend is now frustrated as some of the other bridesmaids have made alterations to the dresses and cannot return them, and she would have wanted them to wear a different dress if it were not for my modesty needs. She's also annoyed that I have backed out as now there is an uneven number of bridesmaids and groomsmen.She says she tried her best to make a compromise with me, the modest dress but no hijab, and I should have explicitly said I would need to wear my hijab and not taken it off while trying on dresses. I think she should have explicitly asked if I would go without before committing to a compromise I didn't even know about.AITA?Edit: I messaged the other bridesmaids explaining that I can't be a bridesmaid anymore as the bride doesn't want me wearing a hijab, and the responses are coming in very much anti-bride so far. I'm hoping the others disagreeing with her on this will snap her out of it. It seems like she's overall stressed and focusing in on this one thing too much and hopefully if she stops to think about it she'll register that it's not a big deal if I'm wearing a hijab.Edit 2: got my first Islamophobic message from user sirharryflashman. Surprised it took this long.Edit 3: second place for sending Islamophobic messages goes to the charmingly named user Bitchtits024240. And third is disappointingly a Jedi master who should know better, user kiadi-mundi who sent an interesting twist on the Islamophobia: sexually explicit messages to try and make me uncomfortable."
1,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting my daughter a better laptop than my son?,20531,m1h95d,1623,"My son and daughter are both 17.  I got both of them  great laptops 4 years ago that should have lasted until now.  My son broke his just a year after they were bought.  I would’ve made him get one of the low quality laptops that their school issues, but my mom got him a new one.  He broke that one too in just 2 years. After that, I made him get one from his school.  A few days ago, that one broke.  I paid the school for it and decided to get him a used laptop that will be enough for school but not too expensive.  My daughter’s has worked fine until now.  Last week, my 7 year old spilled water on it and it doesn’t work anymore.  I’m getting her a pretty expensive new laptop because she hasn’t broken any electronics before and it wasn’t her fault.  My son saw that she’s getting a better laptop than him and he said that I’m being unfair.  I told him that he’s destroyed 3 laptops in 4 years and money doesn’t grow on trees.  He said that I’m picking favorites, and I love her more than him.  I said that he can get a better one with his own money when he starts working.  Am I the asshole?"
2,Not the A-hole,AITA For refusing to let my stepdaughter use my daughter's wedding dress?,10017,m1idmw,1180,I'll try my best to explain the situation and make sure to present both sides.I (f49) met my stepdaughter Zoey 2.5 years ago. I married her father less than 5months ago. It was a small and private celebration sine that's what we felt was the best thing to do since I'm still grieving my daughter Lauren who passed away from sepsis at the age of 26. It was so sudden. She was doing okay and was getting ready for her wedding that was supposed to happen the same month she passed away. We still don't know what went wrong. We were devastated to say the least. Her fiance had a hard time adapting to the new normal. I still have contact with him. We're very close.I took most of her belongings including her wedding dress. We bought it together and she put alot of her touches on it. Worked hard on it. Although it hurt to look at it. I make sure it's safe.Zoey's younger than Lauren. She's 23. We're not very close and distance is one of the reasons why. But we're very respectful towards each other. The issue started when Zoey visited to talk about her wedding in april. We were talking about wedding dresses and she suddenly brought up Lauren's wedding dress. I asked her what about it and she said she saw it several times and it got stuck on her mind. Asked if she could see it and I let her.She then said she'd like to wear it at her wedding. I felt uneasy. I told her I wasn't sure that was a good idea. She told me it's fine she'll have to change few things in it so it can fit her size and style but this is why I had a hard time accepting. I told her I was sorry but I can't let her have it. She offered me money but its sentimental value is what matters to me. She argued saying I was making things complicated and it was alright since she too is my daughter. She Asked if I don't love her as much I told her my love for her is different but she threw a fit calling me unfair and unreasonable to still say no.Her dad got involved in the argument saying he doesn't see why I'm against it. I declined to discuss it anymore but they kept bringing it up asking if my daughter would've wanted someone else to have the opportunity to wear this dress since she unfortunately couldn't. This made me so mad I lashed out at both of them and kept saying no. Others said that I had no right to act like that leaving the dress in the closet when my stepdaughter can make good memories with it. But she said she's planning on changing its look.
3,Not the A-hole,AITA for “guilting” my family into getting a one story home?,2911,m1j4ka,429,"My mom got a new job so we’re moving closer so she has less transportation time. She’s said that she wants it to be a family decision, and we’ve looked at a bunch of houses. While we have been looking for one I’ve mentioned that it would be nice if we could move somewhere that’s one floor so that half the house isn’t off limits for me (I’m in a wheelchair) and originally my mom said it shouldn’t really matter as long as there’s a bedroom and a bathroom on the ground floor. But at every house she’s liked that has two stories I’ve mentioned how I’d prefer it to be one floor. Today she snapped a bit and said that it’s unfair that I’m trying to guilt her about it when she already does a lot for me and that my preferences shouldn’t decide where we live, but my dad is also kind of on my side and has said that we should get something that’s one story as well. Was I the asshole for guilting her?"
4,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting upset with one of my coworkers who used my sonogram to 'fool' her exboyfriend into thinking she was pregnant?,7631,m1efiv,467,"Hello everyone. I am 27F. My husband and I  found out  two months ago we are expecting our first child. Last week, we officially announced it via text and phone calls to our friends and family. The next day at work, I found out that one of my coworkers had taken the photo of the sonogram I had sent them in the group text (someone had asked to see it) and posted it on her social media to 'fool' her exboyfriend (who she broke up with a few weeks ago) into thinking she was pregnant. I never wanted my sonogram on the internet, I don't have a facebook or an instagram or anything like that, and i feel extremely uncomfortable that it's out there without me being able to control the audience of who is looking at it. Also, this seems like an extremely cruel trick to play on someone, and she used *my* sonogram as a prop for this mean joke. When I expressed that I was upset to my coworker, she said i was being 'dramatic' and I am 'just looking for something to be upset over'. She said she covered up all identifying information, and that it was only up for a few hours and she told her exboyfriend the truth after 'making him sweat for a bit'. are pregnancy hormones making me more upset about this than I should be? AITA?"
5,Not the A-hole,AITA for not allowing my oldest daughter to use my home as her wedding venue because her mother and her family will be invited? I had a restraining order against them until recently.,19343,m18qrf,1764,"I'm in a pretty bad situation right now.When my stepdaughter got married two years ago, she used our home as the wedding venue. We have a meadow in our backyard that is able to accomodate a large number of people, as well as a empty clean barn that can be setup for dinner tables.My daughter was supposed to marry at another location last year but because of the pandemic, the venue shut down permanently.She's now asked to use my home for the wedding but I told her my issues with that. I had a restraining order against her mother, my ex, and a few members of her family after  threats and harrassment were directed towards my wife and myself.The restraining order expired mid last year but we haven't heard from them since but I stayed firm in my decision.This has upset my daughter greatly and she's screamed at me which she's never done.I offered to give her 15 thousand dollars for an alternative venue but now she's adamant about it being our home. I feel extremely uncomfortable giving my ex and her family access to my home because that's where the washrooms will be.My daughter has put this issue on Facebook and I now have all of my extended family against me. This has also stirred up my ex and her family against me.And worse is that my wife and stepdaughter are now being accused of trying to ruin my daughter's wedding when they haven't played any part in it.I'm planning on giving in and letting my daughter use our home for the wedding later this year. But I'm going to tell my wife and stepdaughter not to be around for it. Which I'm sure is going to create a bunch of other issues.Am I the asshole?UPDATE TO MY POST: I messaged my daughter about the outdoor trailer bathrooms and she has refused and said it was a disgusting idea. She then accused me of treating her worse then my stepdaughter and that I play favorites and that I'm a terrible father.She does not want the wedding at our home anymore and hung up.She is no longer picking up my calls.I got an angry call from my mother who says she is hosting her wedding instead. And that I will not be welcomed at the wedding. My father will be walking my daughter down the aisle instead of me.Thanks everyone for the advice. I appreciate it. But I feel like I've made the biggest mistake of my life. I'm completely heartbroken."
6,Not the A-hole,AITA if I ask my neighbors with a baby to keep it inside while it's crying?,2701,m1gl1x,1155,"Basically my neighbors across and left one house had a baby. They have this annoying habit of taking it when it's crying outside where it cries for an hour or more. Edit: They're with it the whole time when it's crying. They're not just leaving it outside lolI sent them an anonymous letter asking them to please keep it inside and not annoy everyone in a 3 house radius. I'll just type in here what I wrote.""Hi, congrats on your kid! I wanted to ask of you could please keep the crying baby inside. We hear it cry from quite far away. Thanks for considering it neighbor."" I get it that kids cry, but at last make it more manageable for the rest of us. That was about a week ago. I assume they got the letter about 3 days ago? Yesterday evening they were knocking on all their nearby neighbor's doors and asking them if they send the letter and they were pretty irate about the whole thing. One of their other neighbors was yelling back at them and saying they would have sent a longer letter about how annoying their baby was.Wife said I shouldn't have done that, but I see it as a harmless suggestion to offer. AITAEdit: I say ""it"" because idk of it's a baby boy or girl. Isn't that how you refer to babies?"
7,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling a guy a sexist pig,5159,m1c86r,331,"So, I’m in wood shop at my school. I don’t look like the kind of person you’d see in wood shop. I’m 4’8”, 75 pounds, my hair and makeup are always done, and I wear a lot of skirts and dresses to school. But my dad owns a hardware store and I’ve been building since I could walk. My school has this thing every March where you go to 3 elective classes and watch a 20 minute presentation on what you do in the class. For freshman and sophomore years I was in advanced drama and advanced concert choir and I was in all the school plays and concerts but I also worked behind the scenes and was building these big staircases and balconies and all this other shit but people don’t really see that. So I walked into wood shop for the presentation and this huge guy tried to block me from coming in and said “wrong class, princess. Art’s down the hall.” I told him I know and I was there for the wood shop presentation. This dude smirked and said some bs about me not being strong enough for that class then said “this is why girls aren’t in wood shop” I said “yeah because this class is full of sexist pigs” and went to the choir class to help the teacher with his demonstration. Well, in an unexpected turn of events, wood shop isn’t offered at my school anymore because the teacher retired and they can’t find a new teacher and that guy is in the drama class that I TA in. He’s complained to the teacher countless times about how I’m rude to him and that I grade his work unfairly (such a bitch move to take points off his tests for questions he got wrong and arrange the seating chart so he’s not with his friends because when they’re together they’re very disruptive) so I wanted to know if I’m an asshole for calling him a sexist pig last year because it’s causing problems in my class now"
8,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not paying ""my share"" of a debt?",4744,m19g2f,482,"This happened earlier today during our last class. (I live in Norway, so lockdown isn't very harsh right now.)I went to my table and found a leather bracelet with what seemed to be gold attached on it. I would just like to clarify that it was on top of my computer which I had left on the table to go talk to some friends.So I pick up the bracelet and look at it for a bit, and while I was admiring it, the dude in front of me (let's call him Joe) turned and asked if he could take a look. I told him ""Sure, do what you want with it, it ain't mine,"" and gave it to him.Thing is, when I said ""do whatever you want,"" I didn't expect that the first thing Joe would do was to rip it to shreds. I just stared at him blankly, but didn't comment on it.A couple minutes later, the owner of the bracelet (let's call him Phil) found it in pieces on top of Joe's table and began shouting angrily. He said something about how it cost several hundred bucks, and I just thought to myself ""yikes, Joe is in trouble.""That was until Joe began pointing at me and saying that I was the one who gave it to him, making it MY fault. I just scoffed and thought that no one would listen to that BS, but to my surprise, somehow everyone in class agreed that I should be the one paying.I then proceeded to tell them that HE was the one who broke it, and that I only expected him to take a quick look at it or something, and not just instantly destroy it.The arguments flew back and forth for a while before Phil finally said that we should split the price 50/50. I refused. Everyone began calling me childish and stingy for not wanting to pay for something that was ""my fault,"" but I refused every time.I felt bad about it when I came home, so I asked my parents about it, and unlike my classmates, they actually agreed with me, but I'm unsure whether or not it's because they actually agree, or if it's because they don't want to pay.I usually know when I'm in the right or wrong, but with so many different opinions, I really don't know this time.So Reddit, am I the asshole for this?UPDATE:After reading your comments, I noticed that many of you think that it's a scam, but I can personally confirm that it's not. I worded it really poorly, sorry for that, but when I said ""rip it to shreds"" I meant that he ripped the gold from the leather part. The thing was actually plated gold as far as I could tell, so I doubt that it was a scam. I realise that I only mentioned gold once in the post, and not even confirming if it actually was or wasn't. Again, I worded it badly, and sorry for the confusion."
9,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my MIL we put all the things she bought for the baby by the side of the road?,3818,m1aart,292,"I expect this will divide opinion so need a balanced perspective. My (29F) husband (32M) has a stepmother (55F) called T. T is an over-gifter and always goes over the top despite us asking to only get one or two things. Its quantity over quality, not to our tastes and rarely something we want or need. It takes a long time sorting what to donate and what to bin. Sometimes the stuff is visibly dirty from being in their house (they live in squalor.) T also has mental health issues, she can be emotionally volatile and uses her vulnerability as a weapon. We are new parents to a week old baby. Family has been supportive and helpful. T has been very over the top. She wants to see the baby immediately and drop off some gifts, we said we don't feel comfortable with that (they live far away and just had covid) they were upset. Today we get a text saying ""baby stuff is outside."" We find 6 huge bin bags, 3 large boxes and a bunch of smaller bags full of stuff. Looking through we find dirty, stained blankets and clothes, and other stuff we have no need or use for, they never asked us what we need.Husband is angry, I write a text to T:""Hi T, this is a lot of stuff. We're grateful you want to provide for your grandchild, but we asked you not to get too much. A new baby does not need a lot, we already have a lot of the things we need and we do not have space to store any more. We also asked you not to travel to bring it. We are hurt and disappointed you went against what we asked, even though it is for a kind gesture. Your generous nature is one of the things we love most about you. The most generous thing you can do is respect our wishes. From now on please ask what we need and get only what we have asked for so we can make sure we only have what we need.""I get no response. After a while I start looking through the stuff and I'm angry. Angry at the amount, angry at the quality and angry that they went against our wishes. I send another text:""T, I have just seen the extent of it. You have gone against our wishes and gone too far this time. We have put it all by the road and posted it to facebook as free to collect for someone who needs it. We are hurt and disappointed by your actions. You need to think about how you respect our wishes regarding (baby) in the future."" Her response was that they will stay away from us because clearly we don't want them in the baby's life. This is not what we want.I understand her gift giving comes from love, I also think its due to trauma in her past. She's not a bad person. I feel awful for telling her what we did. Imagine buying all that stuff, then told it has been put by the road. At the same time I want to give her a wake up call. That she would choose not be in her grandchild's life rather than respect our wishes is upsetting.Was the second text message justified or was it too much?Update: I wrote this post last night. The update today is I had a call from the council and my FIL has reported me for fly tipping. I had to explain to the council the stuff was on my driveway and collected as part of a private sale. My FIL is equal in his part in this. ETA: fly tipping is the illegal dumping of waste in a place where waste should not be dumped. It is a criminal act punishable by a fine. In the message I told them we put the stuff ""by the road"", this would be illegal. Actually the stuff never left our property, someone from facebook collected it for free from our driveway, perfectly legal."
10,Not the A-hole,AITA for not refunding an Airbnb guest that damaged my home?,971,m1is3d,155,"Ok this is going to require some background to tell the full story. My wife and I run an Airbnb in our home that we also live in. We had a guest, we’ll call her R, that reached out to us through Airbnb to book a room. In the end we made an arrangement with her outside of Airbnb for her to stay a month in a small room. She paid us and moved in and everything seemed fine. About a week into her stay, at around 4am I heard a crashing sound but ignored it and went back to sleep. Later in the morning I’m woken up by R walking into my bedroom followed by my wife yelling at R to go back to her room. Finally R returns to her room but only for a few minutes before walking outside and away from the house in the middle of winter with no shoes on. We call the police to hopefully get her to a hospital, which ends up happening. Best we can figure R had some sort of mental breakdown because she was like a zombie and was non responsive. Upon going through her room later we found drug paraphernalia (a small cylinder with burns on the end of it), so it might have been drug induced. In her room we found a huge hole in the wall (I assume that was the crashing sound I heard). Throughout the house we found signs of her entry and found some items moved and/or damaged. The damages required us to spend money on repairs.We tracked down R in the hospital and brought her her phone and insurance info. She claimed she had a seizure but we are skeptical. Anyway we told her we could hold onto her stuff until she got out but when she did she would have to find another place to stay. Toward the end of the month that she had paid for she texted us and stated we could bring her stuff to the facility she was staying in and that she deserved a refund because we told her she had to find another place. We returned her stuff but denied the refund request with the thought process that she caused damage to our home and it’s not our fault that she had an episode and didn’t use the time she paid for. Plus we kept her stuff safe for the whole month. Arguments that IATA include that she is likely mentally ill and she told us she was poor and needed the money. Also the cost to fix the damage she caused was not equal to the amount she paid us initially."
11,Not the A-hole,AITA for putting rules on mental health days?,4314,m186bh,760,"Oblitory throwaway for privacy.I am the mother of 2 teenagers. A 17 year old junior, Suzy and a 14 year old freshman, Tom. During Suzy's freshman year, her workload and stress was thru the roof so my husband and I decided we would implement ""mental health days"". We had no rules for a day other than be reasonable about when you take them and they couldn't be on test days. This worked great and over the past few years, Suzy spread out her days throughout the year and only took about 3 or 4 each school year.Tom is where we come to our problem. He is also allowed mental health days with the same rules and expectations, but he has taken advantage. This year alone, he has taken about 25 days. He hasn't been using the days for his mental health, its been for sleeping in because he wants to stay up all night(no bedtimes, just have to get up in the morning no matter when you went to bed), hanging out to get more time on his video games, or to hang out with friends that skip.this came to a head last week when he was talking to us at dinner about a game release coming up and how he plans to use mental health days so he can stay home and play.Tbh, I was fuming when he said this. I told him he had no more mental health days he could use this year and they are not for video games. He yelled that he could do what he wanted for his mental health days. I informed him there would now be rules on them. They can no longer be used to sleep in, they couldn't be used to sit and play games all day, and they would not be used to hang out with friends. I told them all if you had to take multiple health days a month, you would be attending therapy. The kids were mad but my husband agreed infront of them.When we were alone, he blew up on me saying I couldn't put rules on mental health days and I was being cruel to our kids. I argued back that our kids were not going to walk all over me when it comes to these days and if it continues, then I'm ending them all together. He called me a bitch and now we aren't speaking(when not in front of the kids). AITA?"
12,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting mad at my wife for her “jokes” about me not helping around the house or with our baby?,17070,m12gl5,2139,"My wife and I both work. Only difference is she actually goes into the office and I’m still working from home. We have a 10 month old daughter and I’ve been basically a stay at home dad on top of working my regular day job. It was stressful as hell when my wife finished up her maternity leave but luckily my work is pretty flexible so I’m not usually super busy. Most of the day, I’m replying to emails on my phone with my daughter in her carrier or taking conference calls while she’s napping. I also do the cleaning around the house because I’m a total neat freak and order or cook dinner too if I have the time. Then in the evenings my wife takes over so I have some leisure time. On Sunday we went to have lunch at her sisters house. First time we’ve all seen eachother in a while. They ask us how life’s going with a new baby and my wife starts jokes about the house being a mess when she gets home and her having to clean it up because I’ve been too busy playing with our daughter all day to do it myself.When her sister’s husband asked how I manage I admitted it does get overwhelming sometimes and my wife once again chimed in saying I call her constantly throughout the day over little things. Like not being able to find our daughters binky or needing her help because daughter won’t stop crying and I have no idea what to do.She also laughed about how everyday when she gets home she just prays I didn’t burn the house down. I know it was all said in a lighthearted joking around way, but it really hurt my feelings. Everyone was chuckling except me, so my wife kissed me cheek telling not to take it too seriously and she appreciates that i put in the effort. So I straight up told her “well I don’t appreciate you acting like I’m useless when I’m the one at home taking care of her all day and cleaning the house.” My wife didn’t know how to respond to that and we changed the subject. She was in a serious mood after we left because I “embarrassed” her and it wouldn’t have hurt for me to let her joke around a little because she knows I help out a lot.I’ve been distant with her, not talking much when she gets home and she’s mad at me for taking it too seriously. Even her sister says I’m overreacting but I just don’t see why she thought it was okay to paint me as the cliche useless man-child husband. Now I have my wife saying I’m being a bit of an ass for still holding this against her and she doesn’t see why it’s a big deal to me.Part of me just feels hurt and I’d like an apology, but another part wonders if I am being an ass for how I’m acting with her."
13,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to have a do-over wedding as we eloped already?,5020,m14ok6,440,"I was meant to get married last year at a full on big white wedding arranged and paid for by mine and my husband's parents. It got cancelled for obvious reasons and everyone got their money back. Around the same time, both myself and my husband had falling outs with our parents/siblings that meant we didn't talk to our families for a while.Edit - his family don't like me and mine don't like him. We invited them all to a large dinner, which was mistake #1. We have a small age gap and neither side is happy about it, so when his side started making passive aggressive comments about me, my side made comments about my husband.We realised that when we weren't talking to our families, we no longer wanted a big wedding. Further discussion showed that we were pretty much only doing it for our parents, as they were paying for it, but without that in the equation, we'd both be perfectly happy with a smaller event, so long as we were married at the end of it. When we were able to do it safely, we agreed to just order a certificate and take a few friends to the registrar's office, then get a takeaway to celebrate, and it was perfect. We did end up travelling to a different area of the country for a couple weeks as a honeymoon, but again we made sure it was all safe.We're now back in touch with our respective families, aside from a few individuals, and they want the wedding back on, rescheduled to whenever it's safe. We told them we already got married and they said this could be considered a reception. They still have the money from the first wedding so they can afford it. However, we don't want this. We've had our wedding day, we don't need another. We also recently found out that I'm pregnant, so we said to them if they really need a use for the money then something baby related (eg a trust fund) might be a nice way to use it, but they said it's for a reception only. We said fine then, no reception, keep the money, but they said they missed our actual wedding so they want to give us a do-over that they can see.Edit - to be clear, if we agree to the do-over, they are absolutely planning on waiting until it's safe to invite lots of people to a large gathering, not putting a pregnant woman (me) into a room of random people in the middle of a plagueWe've held firm on not wanting anything further as the way we see it is we're already married and happy with our small ceremony/reception, we don't need a do-over. They, however, see this as a punishment as we got married in the time we weren't speaking and didn't inform them until we got back in touch, and think our actions here are petty and uncalled for. They also say it's their money, they'll arrange everything, all we have to do is show up, and our refusal is totally unreasonable given the miniscule amount we'd have to do in order to make them happy.Are we the arseholes?"
14,Not the A-hole,AITA for sitting in another barbers chair right after leaving the shitty barbers chair?,500,m1h34b,48,"I’ve been going to this place for years, theres plenty good barbers besides my (great) barber. On the other hand theres this creepy barber who everyone avoids because he’s supposedly the worst barber they have. I call him creepy because he has big eyes and he stares a LOT. I go inside and im not suprised to see my normal barber isnt there (as he earns enough to not really need to cut hair). Looking around for him, was the cue for the bad barber who was literally finishing a fucking chicken wing to signal me over. I hesitated as i locked eyes with another (good) barber but didnt wanna seem like an ass so proceeded to the bad guy. This man was definitely tweaking lightly. Seemed to be rushing and shaking. Afterwards he spun me toward the mirror and asked “ya like it?” Fuck nooo my hairline was pushed back a bit further and it wasnt even. It looked odd. Im literally laid back 80% of the time but this is just one of those times i instinctly got annoyed. I said “...nahhh man this shit booty my lines are very crooked. He said “whaaat” as if he was trying to pretend he didnt see. I walked right over to the good barber, handed him $10 and asked if he can fix it. Booboo barber says “i can fix it” to which i say fuck no my good sir. I had to get some kind of black dye to fill in until my hair grows back where he messed up. Excuse the profanity, but remember he has been there years. He has gotten no better but is constantly signaling unwanted customers over. Eating soul food and shit."
15,Not the A-hole,AITA for not paying my sister as an interior designer for my new place?,804,m1cn2i,140,"My wife and I just upgraded our home to a much larger place. Objectively, it’s a pretty great place, around 6000 square feet. We were able to buy it thanks to our business really taking off due to the pandemic, we were in a lucky industry that actually thrived, as well as some great investments we’ve made over the years. We still are at our old place while we get the new one set up. My younger sister “Jill” is 24 and recently decided she thinks her calling is to be an interior designer. Naturally when she saw the place we just bought she asked if she can help us decorate/furnish it. My wife has always had great taste so hiring someone didn’t really seem necessary but I told her she’s welcome to provide some input as practice if she’d like. Jill did a walkthrough of our new house, took pictures and measurements, and then the next day sent us a whole lot of recommendations for how to furnish everything as well as an order form including her “cut” of everything. I thought I made it clear that I was not hiring her. We really don’t need hired help, I was just willing to let her get her beak wet a bit in her new field of choice. She didn’t take that well. She said she spent hours working on this and the least I could do was pay her for her time but that I really should go with her suggestions and pay her what she says is a discounted rate compared to what her friend in the field does. I’m all about helping her get exposure to the industry but I’m not trying to spend thousands of dollars unnessarily. My wife also said she feels like we’re being taken advantage of and doesn’t feel like we actually need any of her help either. This has turned into a whole ordeal where now my mom is on Jills side too saying if I really want to be supportive I should support “her new business”. In me and my wife’s view we made it clear we were not agreeing to everything or we would have made a contract...trying to navigate these waters without hurting too many feelings or wasting money but want to get a 3rd party perspective on if I’m being unreasonable."
16,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my parents they can't speak about what made me happier?,6719,m12a3f,434,"My parents are divorced. They divorced when I (15f) was 6. Both of them are married again to other people, and I have two huge blended families either side. My mom has three more kids and seven stepkids, while my dad has four more kids and two stepkids and is raising his wife's two niece's. I also have a brother who was 8 when our parents divorced. We both have pretty similar thoughts on the whole thing. We're sad our family didn't work out, will always wish it had, would have been easier for us if it had in some ways, but we know they are happier and better off apart.Back before lockdown, when schools were still open, we had to do this personal essay. And I did mine on how complicated it is to have divorced parents and be part of blended families. I spoke about how I wished it was different, how I knew it was better overall, and just in general how it can be hard to have that change in your life and how going between houses and stuff is not fun or easy.Anyway, my parents didn't like it and well they decided to talk to me about how I was happier since the divorce and why would I write that way when I know it's true. I told them it was far more complicated than it was for them. They said but now I have four parents instead of two. And I told them it's a lot more complicated than that.It's been a thing ever since. They keep trying to tell me how I feel and how the blended families make me happier because I have more people to love. They believe my relationship with my stepparents is the same, on the same level, as with them, and that I feel the same about the step and half siblings as I do my brother.So I sat both of them down recently and told them they cannot speak for my feelings. That I'm allowed to have complicated feelings on the whole thing. I'm allowed to miss my original family unit, when things were simple and I didn't have to move between two houses and two families.  I told them they're my parents but they're not the people who dictate my emotions and they would push me away if they kept that shit up.They're pissed for how I handled the conversation. Saying I was ""threatening"" them with estrangement and basically dismissing the fact they are my parents and get to make decisions that they know is right for me. I told them it was very different. That I didn't say they shouldn't have divorced but they cannot say how I feel about it.Things are weird now and I'm wondering if I did go too far.AITA?"
17,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I told my neighbor to tell her kids to knock it off with ringing my doorbell all the time... again?!,1367,m17bix,197,"I (31f) am a single mom of two (8m and 10f). We've lived in our 2 bedroom apartment for 7 years now. Just for info - our building has 6 apartments in it including ours. Two on the first floor, 2 on the second,  2 on the third. All of my neighbors utterly hate each other. And when I say hate, I do mean hate. Nobody gets along and I'm the only one that somehow managed to sail through this with my kids without issues. Now - to enter the building and to get to the apartment door itself, you either need a key or you need to ring the doorbell outside and get buzzed in.My 1st floor neighbor, married, 4 kids, doesn't work and had baby no 4 at the beginning of last year. Her kids (15, 10, 8, 1) get along well with my kids. They walk to school together and play outside together in the summer. I'm the go-to in the neighborhood for any help, snacks, conflict solving e.t.c and I absolutely don't mind it at all and enjoy the peace around us. Now here's the issue where I need to know...WIBTA?Since before the youngest member downstairs was born, before the pandemic hit, the kids downstairs would ring my doorbell multiple times per day at different hours, just to be let into the stairway. At first I didn't mind too much, until it became more frequently. I'd be in the middle of a phone conference with my boss (I work from home), am doing the whole pandemic home schooling thing, under the shower, cooking e.t.c and constantly have to run through my apartment just to open the door for them. I got more and more aggravated (btw, my kids always have their own key on them and if they ring, it's always our door. Never ever any of the neighbors).I tried to remain calm and kind, since she was at first pregnant and then with a newborn, but about 2 months ago, during a video conference with my boss, they rang 4 times within 1 1/2 hours just to be let into the stairway and I had it.I messaged mom and explained as kindly as possible, to please talk to her kids to not use me as a door opener. It reflects badly on my work if my boss hears it ring all the time and I don't want to lose my job over this. I'd always be there in case of emergencies of course, but to please knock it off in these scenarios. She said she'd talk to them and it got quiet. However, this lasted only a week. Now we're back to 2-3 rings per day, starting around 11.30am when I'm in the middle of work. I want to tell mom off again, but my bf says I'd be a huge AF and that there's no harm in opening the door and that they probably don't want to wake the baby. I do get that, but they're 6 people down there, they have to open the apartment door regardless of me letting them in the stairway. So...WIBTA if I said something again?"
18,Not the A-hole,Aita for leaving my daughter to go to my father's funeral,643,m1b23p,217,"I 35(m) found out that my father died about a 2 weeks ago. (I left home at 16 because of some family drama and I havn't had contact with any of my family). I'm not sure how, but my brother was able find me and told me the news. It was the same day as my daughter's(18) Sex reassignment surgery. I originally wasn't going to go because I thought being there for my daughter was more important. The more I thought about it the more I wanted closure and answers. So a few days ago I talked to my wife about it and she agreed but she said that I should talk to our daughter. My daughter said that she didn't want me to go I after I told her. She said that if I did then I would be abandoning her when she needed me the most. I told her that i would never abandon her but this was something important that i had to do. She said that if I left then she doesn't want anything to do with me. I tried talking to her about it but she just ignored me. Well I packed my bags and got on a plane back to VA. When I got there I saw my father get buried and I talked to my mother, siblings, and other family members. I was able to get the answers and closure that I was looking for. when I got home my daughter was pissed I tried to apologize but she called me a transphobic asshole. My wife said that it was a hard decision to make but It wasn't necessarily a bad one. Honestly idk what to think.Aitb ?"
19,Not the A-hole,Wibta if I told my mom's best friend that she can't bring her husband to my wedding?,472,m1cz5r,95,"I grew up kind of different than most people. My mom's family is absolutely awful and toxic so she cut off every single person from her family except for her dad who died a few years ago. Since she had no family, she made her friends her family. I call each of them mom, momma, auntie, or ma. Auntie babysits my kids and I'm very close to every one of them. However, momma has a husband who is the literal definition of scum. He's done awful things to me and to other people that I'm not allowed to mention due to the rules in this group. He's an awful alcoholic and I've never once seen him sober. Because of his past actions, I've kept him far away from me, my children, and my fiance.I was discussing a guest list with my real mom and she said ""you know, if you invite momma you have to invite her husband"" I told her plain and simple, no I don't. It's my wedding, not his and if she can't come without him then she's not coming. My mom quickly agreed but when I talked to my dad, who is friends with momma's husband, he said I couldn't invite one without inviting the other. He says it's completely wrong and if I'm not inviting him, I shouldn't be inviting her and her daughter.I truly don't believe I'm ta but I might be because it is kind of shitty to tell someone they can't bring their husband to a wedding. At the same time, she knows who he is and I don't think she actually likes him so she might not react badly.Edit: a lot of people are questioning why my dad is friends with him, which I totally get and it bothers me too. But it is something that we just don't talk about. When my parents were married he hated him because he's a garbage person. When they got divorced my dad started hanging around him because my dad was depressed and started drinking a lot. It's an issue that has already been addressed and dealt with.Edit 2: I already know my dad can be an ass about a lot of things but in this case, he simply stated his opinion because I asked for his opinion and he isn't trying to get me to invite him. He does understand and I think to an extent he also agrees and he hasn't brought it up even once. While he's an asshole, he's a supportive asshole."
20,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling my boyfriend I can be doing ""other things"" instead of watching him play video games?",336,m1ezuc,131,"I'm going to keep this post short but to the point.My bf is 24 & I'm 23.Because of COVID-19 my boyfriend works from home on his computer and attends online college lectures. My boyfriend plays from the minute he wakes up which is around 7:45am to around 10pm with an hour or so break in between to go to the gym. On weekends its from noon to past midnight some days. I've lived with him for a month in Feb so I've seen him play while working and listening to lectures ALL day. It is very possible for him to ""multitask"" during work and school because I've watched him do it for a month straight.We see each other every day sometimes for an hour or two during the week and during the weekend usually all day Saturday and Sunday.When we see each other especially on the weekend he will spend all day playing video games with friends while ""studying"" and I'm sat there in his room (we both still live with our parents) bored out of my mind. If he isn't playing he is on Discord on his phone or just on his phone in general. I lived with him a month and I can't even think of one really good conversation we had together that entire month. It got to the point where I was so frustrated to be there with him but spend no quality time together, that I packed my overnight bags and told him I could be doing other things and running errands instead of sitting on his bedroom floor on a Sunday afternoon while he plays video games. And after that I put my things in my car and left after telling him I love him and that I'd see him later that night (which didn't happen because he was mad at me).Needless to say, he was upset and mad at me. He even shut me out for the rest of the day and was weird and distant with me the following day. I think it's actually kind of selfish for him to be playing video games 14+ hours a day and expect me to just sit there and be alright doing nothing all day by myself in a house that isn't mine over the weekend.To be honest, my reaction was a build up of months of frustration. Our first Valentine's Day together was spent with him playing video games. No different than any other day. And the only thing I got him to do was go on a 30 min walk, that is it.I have talked to him a handful of times explaining that I don't see quality time as him playing video games while I lie around doing nothing. He isn't oblivious to the fact that I don't like it either because he has mentioned to his friends a number of times saying ""my gf hates that I play this game so much too"".Also just wanted to add that he wants to see me every day and gets upset and even mad if we don't see each other (he was diagnosed w/ BPD which may cause that reaction). But in the same token takes my presence for granted.Am I the asshole for packing up my stuff and leaving?"
21,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my sister she’s gonna mess up her hair,459,m1b984,151,"This just happened and my (f16) sister (13) is pissed at me.I walked into the kitchen to grab a snack before class and my sisters hair was a greasy mess. We both hang out in our rooms a lot and I’ve been helping my neighbor paint her house and work on her garden and running errands for her (she’s 84 so she needs some help sometimes. She pays me tho) so I haven’t been near her much. I asked her about her hair and she said she isn’t washing her hair right now (has very oily hair and hasn’t washed it in 10 days apparently) and is putting coconut oil in her hair every day because someone on tiktok said that was great for her hair. We have very different hair types (I have dry curly hair and she has oily straight hair) but I’m pretty sure that isn’t good for your hair. And even if it’s not unhealthy, her hair looks horrible.I told her she needs to start washing her hair and not put coconut oil in her hair every day because her hair looks messy. She said a hairstylist said it’s good for everyone and I should do it too. I told her there’s no way in hell I’m gonna go almost 2 weeks without washing my hair and I hate doing coconut oil in my hair. She told me I’m gonna destroy my hair by not doing this and I told her she’s destroying hers by not washing it and by adding that much oil to it every day. Now she thinks I’m an asshole and won’t talk to meUpdate: she washed her hair. Still looks like a greasy mess"
22,Not the A-hole,AITA for having very different diets for my children?,441,m1be32,175,"My wife and I (both women) have three children between us: Jana, Becca, and James. James and Jana had regular childhoods and are 50/50 between us and their father. Becca grew up with her grandmother and father and was in foster care for a while before ending up with us. Jana and James are both dangerously overweight and their doctor has advised that they need to lose weight and live a healthier lifestyle. Becca is dangerously underweight, and due to abuse that happened with her grandmother and father, has stomach problems that make eating enough or gaining weight very difficult. Despite surgeries to fix the problems with her digestive system, she will always have a much smaller stomach capacity than normal for the rest of her life. We've been working with nutritionists for all 3 children. For Jana and James, we have a diet plan that their father has shockingly also agreed to at least try. We're framing it as eating healthier as a family, and my wife and I are following it too. Becca's nutritionist has advised that she focus on eating high-calorie foods, even if they are considered ""junk foods"". We have to make major changes for James and Jana, and honestly for ourselves in general, but it creates a concern for Becca. In addition to stomach capacity, she also can't eat meat or meat substitutes and has other psychological issues with food, making eating a struggle most of the time. She wouldn't physically be able to eat enough calories to even maintain her current weight with the foods we're now making for our meals, which is not okay. All this has let to a situation where we have to beg one child to eat fries and cake while banning dessert from the others. We try to eat dinner every night and this is making it a huge problem. For example, we made grilled chicken, rice, and broccoli for all of us, and made Becca a vegetable lasagna with broccoli on the side. As you can imagine, they're starting to complain. They say we're making them feel fat and like we're letting Becca ""just do what she wants"" because she's thin. That's not true. She already has to eat smaller portions at a time, and needs extra calories on top of it. She is also already halfway to an eating disorder and that needs to be undone. They've drawn other relatives into it, and opinions are split. Some of them agree that we're ""bodyshaming"" and treating Becca better because she's thin, and some of them understand but think we should be doing things differently."
23,Not the A-hole,AITA for stopping renovating friends house,971,m15s74,93,"AITA for the belowFor a number of years in been helping my friends out doing work on their house.  I have a variatey of skills including electrician bricklayer, plumber, joiner,  window fitterr... and the list goes on.  I used to visit as often as I could.  they were after all trying to completely remodel their house while living in it.   not an easy task.  the issue I have is that while when I'm there I get offers of help and on occasion some stuff was done independantly.  When I am not there literally nothing gets done.   Lets call them Mr and Mrs X.   Mr X  says that he tried to do stuff but Mrs X stops him saying Ill do that later, but later never comes so the task doesnt get completed.  Ive often said to them eithe face to face or via social media that hey Mrs and Mrs X nothing is happening, so normally things start to happen again normally for a few days and then grind to a complete stop.  I had to spend around 5 weeks in hospital with about six months recovery, which was followed by lockdown 1 so it was about a year before I could go back to the job,  during this time nothing had been done, not a scrap of wallpaper had been removed.  So again a kick up the rear end was applied and work resumed and then stopped.  I resumed work on the house almost accepting that this was the way things had to be and there was no change happening.  but little by little it began to chip away at me that I was working for free for people who couldnt even be bothered to clean their own toilet or cooker.  As always when i was there there was offers of help while i was there but much of what i was doing was in tight spaces that only one person could fit in,  but there were other things like filling and sanding and cleaning that could be done.    So i once againg raised the subject after my said i was being used and thar Mr and Mrs X were a pair of lazy toerags and that I was a mug.  there were some comments made about stuff getting done and the next day i was at their house PC's were on games were being payed so i wrigged the conversation back to house progress only to be snarled at by Mrs X as if I was asking them to rebuild their house on the moon.  So today ive told them im not continuing the removations and as it stands i really mean it.  So Am I the asshole?"
24,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my husband to not by me expensive jewellery for this exact reason?,2733,m11j0c,370,"Look I am clumsy and I lose/misplace things so frequently it’s not funny. I have been since I was a kid. I’ve broken every phone I’ve ever had. My laptop has a crack in it. My switch has scratches on the screen, recently just got a screen protector. My nice white tshirts always get stains on them when I wear them (thankfully my mum is a miracle worker at getting them out) I snapped a $350 gold earring I got for Christmas 2 years ago the DAY after I got them. I swear I’m cursed. Like legitimately cursed. But I can live with it. I just don’t buy overly expensive things and if I do I get insurance/warranty or a protector. I told my husband when we first started talking about marriage to not buy me an expensive ring. I don’t care if it’s a real diamond or a cubic zirconia nothing that he wouldn’t complain if I lost or broke. Y’all I’m not joking when I say he bought me a ring over 1k (which is expensive to me my car is worth less than that). At first I would wear it only on dates and family events but he started getting upset. And low and behold I lost it and the wedding band while camping. He said he wasn’t mad and it wasn’t a big deal he’ll get me a new one. (Please note that we’re not rich and the only reason we could even get a one AND a new one is because of lay-bys and I’d much rather that money went to other more important things)So again I told him nothing expensive, seriously. He went out and got a ring set worth more than the original (it was on quite a sale so it itself wasn’t as expensive but without the sale it was more) I again stopped wearing them unless we were on a date or at a family thing. Again he started getting upset so I started wearing them again. I recently got a job at a butchers. I put my rings in my money pouch and then inside a zipped part of my purse while actually working and put them back on when I’m done. Can you believe what happened? Somehow I lost the big ring but not the two bands. I don’t know how, I don’t know where, I’ve turned the house upside down, and my parents house,  and asked my workmates to see if it’s in the office (where we keep our bags). No one can find it anywhere. I’m absolutely devastated and this is why I don’t wear them all the time. Now my husband is mad at me saying I lost it on purpose so I could get a new one and I’m throwing away money. I told him I didn’t want an expensive ring in the first place and I’m going to pick my own this time. I’ve looked and there’s a nice cubic zirconia one that looks almost identical to the one I lost at a fraction of the price. So it’s not like I didn’t like the ring and that’s why I wasn’t wearing it. It’s because I was terrified of losing or breaking it which is exactly what happened. Twice. But he’s insisting I’m wasting money on purpose and if I didn’t like it I should’ve just told him. So am I the asshole for what happened even though he and I knew dam well it was going to happen at some point?Edit To add bc some people have said asked if it’s medical and my bad I forgot to say this in the original post- My hand eye coordination is below average, I’m partially deaf in my left ear, and I have astigmatism and not so good peripheral vision. So yeah it’s a medical thing too. My husband knows all of this btwEdit to add again- no one at my work stole the ring the day I lost it was my boss and the nice older man who would be very upset if I even thought for a second he did. ALSO i work IN a butchers shop, I’m not a butcher haha the only time I ever use a knife is if I’m cutting chicken wings. I don’t use any of the meat cutting machines I mainly prep the windows and serve people. I’m fine guys! And yeah my boss knows about the medical things. We’ve been friends for 6 years and play dnd together so he DEFINITELY knows haha thanks for the concern"
25,Not the A-hole,AITA If I Let My Brother Be Homeless?,318,m1cqjh,97,"I'm currently in college and I have an entire plan to buy a new house once I finish with my schooling, which I've okayed with my parents. The plan involves selling the current house we have now. My parents are going to live with me as I care for my mother anyways due to her COPD and my dad will be his retirement years, I want them to live comfortably and have no problem with them and my diabetic niece living with me. Currently, one of my older brothers is living with us as he lost his apartment due to some bad financial choices. And I do have a problem with him living with me.He is, in a few words, gate-keeping, womanizing, destructive, and unhygienic. He always knows more than you, women are something he just uses and thinks it's crazy if they want to date him instead of just rolling in the sheets, and he doesn't shower, clean up after himself, and I've caught him using MY toothbrush.My brother is stubborn and if you call out his behavior, he does things out of spite. Ask him to close a cabinet he left open? Next time he goes into the kitchen, he'll purposely leave all of the cabinet doors open. Things like that and I know he does it on purpose because he's not afraid to openly brag about it. If you tell him not to do something, he will make sure that he will do it.He also views all of his other siblings as lesser. He doesn't even want to help my other brother, who is a big protective bear, help get a job at his work because he ""thinks he wouldn't be good at the job and doesn't want him embarrassing him"". Despite the fact my other brother has worked in customer service before and did it for much longer than he did. It also angered me that he was refusing to help our brother who has done nothing but be kind to us and watch out for us.I recently told my mom that when I finish my degree and begin to start working on my credit score so I can get a decent house loan, my brother will have to find another place to live. My mom says she doesn't know if my brother will ever be able to support himself with the way things are going due to him spending all of his money on alcohol.Now, here's where I might be the AH. I told my mother I'd take care of my parents, I'd take care of my niece, but I will not mommy my own brother. She said I couldn't just put him on the streets and I replied with, ""I don't want to, but I won't burden someone who will destroy my house and do petty things just get to back at me when I ask him not to do something, then claim I just don't understand due to 'lack of life experience'.""My mom told me she doesn't want me to mommy him either, his mistakes aren't mine, and that it will ultimately be my choice since the house is going to be in my name, however she doesn't want me to do anything that might create a wedge.I've been considering it and she's right, if I don't let my brother live with me, he would be homeless as my sister refuses to let him live with her. AITA if I allow him to be homeless?EDIT: Small thing to add. I'm 25, the youngest out of four, and my brother is 28 and works as a cook for a bar and at a Waffle House. My parents have asked him to get a different job so it's easier for him to get sober, but he refuses. So, he's constantly surrounding himself with temptation."
26,Not the A-hole,AITA for protesting my roommate's cooking?,141,m1gwu0,58,"Hello, Reddit! 29M here. I live with two roommates (28F: ""Sarah""  and 27F: ""Kate""). For the last 6 months, we've had a rotation which each of us cooks dinner once a week. The other four days, we either do our own thing or get food from outside. The point of this was to both save some money and for each of us to get better at cooking. This idea was something all three of us agreed to do.For about four months, this went really well. We were all making some pretty good food, and saving money on restaurants in the process. However, starting about two months ago, there was a drastic decline in Sarah's cooking.Each week for the past two months, Sarah pretty much made the same thing every week. She'd throw three chicken thighs into a pot with some kind of bottled sauce/glaze and heat it to a boil. Then she'd serve it with plain rice. I also noticed she'd do her prep in about 5 minutes, then spend the rest of the time on her laptop or phone until it was cooked.After a while, I got kind of fed up with it. It was repetitive, not good, too simple, and at least for me, not enough food. I'd find myself needing to go out and pick up something to eat from outside most nights Sarah made dinner.After about two months of this going on, I spoke to Kate about it. We were both in agreement that Sarah's meals are not up to par with mine and Kate's in terms of effort or variety, but the fact that it wasn't enough food was uniquely my problem (Apparently one chicken thigh is enough food for Kate).I decided to bring up the issues about the dinner to Sarah on my own. I told her that for the past two months, her dinners haven't up to par with what Kate and I are making each week, and that it wasn't fair to the rotation, since she's eating better than she's delivering.The conversation went more sour than I was anticipating. She didn't seem receptive to what I was saying, and told me that she's just not going to participate in the rotation anymore. We're both currently upset with each other right now, and now I'm left wondering if I was TA in this situation."
27,Not the A-hole,AITA for snapping at my MIL and telling her not to interfere?,150,m1gd20,38,"I am expecting to hear I am TA. But wanted to see.My MIL and I have a decent relationship. Not super close but we've always gotten along and have no trouble spending time together. My husband is very close to his mom and he has confided in her (with my knowledge) about how stressful it is that his ex-wife has worked so hard to alienate my stepchildren against our family. It's to the point where the kids (17m and 15f) have made it clear that I am not a wanted or welcome part of their lives and I am barely tolerated. My husband has always had my back and has been proactive but we didn't find out about the alienation for a while. We thought at first they just had a hard time warming up to me and then we figured they wanted their parents back together, but as she got worse in how she spoke about me to them we figured it out (especially when she slipped up and said some shit about me in front of the kids to my husband and they backed her up).Anyway, recently my husband and stepson had a very big blowout over it and it ended with my husband telling him he's not welcome in our home without an apology. My stepson said some stuff, some very insulting and derogatory stuff that was pretty emotionally cruel in nature, about me, to me, and he made it pretty clear he was not going to apologize. My husband talked to his mom. And after that she called over while my husband was working and started telling me I should never have let his ex turn the kids against me so much and I should have tried harder to combat it and I'm not a victim in this, I'm a willing participant and all I had to do was talk to the kids and spend more time with them and they would have seen. I asked her to stop. She told me she was saying it because she cared and she didn't want her family to divide more and as a mother I should be at least trying to make things better so my kids will have a healthy relationship with their siblings. And I snapped. I told her to butt out and stop stop interfering and how dare she judge me. I told her I have been treated like shit solidly for 8 years and I have never once taken it out on the kids but I do not work magic and it's not her place to imply I did nothing.She's pissed, said I was rude, and we haven't spoken since.I didn't apologize because I hate that she blames me when I never ever neglected my relationship with my stepkids but I also know I can't force myself into every single aspect of their lives and smother them without risking being ""that stepmom"".AITA?"
28,Not the A-hole,AITA for picking my better-behaved niece to be flower girl at my wedding?,1792,m11iwa,543,"My fiance and I are getting married this December. We're having a 100 person wedding because we really just wanted to invite family and close friends. Obviously we're very excited and having a great time planning.My fiance has one nephew who is 7 years old so obviously we chose him to be our ring bearer.For our flower girl -- I have three nieces. My brother Leo has an 8 year old daughter named Natalia. She is an absolute angel, so sweet and well behaved and just always very happy. My other brother John has two daughters, Sarah (she's a baby) and Ivy (7 years old). Just to be very honest - Natalia is way better behaved than Ivy. I love both girls, but Natalia is the one who I can grab to go on an auntie/niece outing on a Saturday and it's a lovely time. She's always happy and polite. Ivy is a sweetheart too, but she's much more moody and temperamental. A day out with her will go well if we do everything she wants (where to go, what to eat, etc.) but even 1 thing going off will lead to tears or, more recently, into an attitude. And I don't blame Ivy for her behavior because honestly it goes back to parenting and the lack of emotional regulation/coping strategies that inevitably occur when a child isn't taught how to self-regulate and instead is pacified immediately with whatever shiny object.But honestly I immediately wanted Natalia as flower girl and when I asked my brother/sister-in-law if it was okay they were really happy about it, so I asked Natalia and she was super excited. I told her she can pick the flowers she wants to drop down the aisle and it's adorable, my sis-in-law texted me about how Natalia has been googling to find the prettiest flowers. When I told my mom (who is planning the wedding with me) that I asked Natalia to be my flowergirl, she immediately was against it. She said that as the grandma she can't enable me to differentiate between the girls, which I understand but she also admitted she sees why I chose Natalia. She was against it and told me to have both girls as flower girls. I decided to think about it for a bit and before you know it, my sis-in-law (Natalia's mom) made an IG post where she mentioned ""We had such a fun day at the park and Natalia finally decided what flowers she's dropping for her auntie's wedding!""My other brother John and his wife are big mad. Maybe I should've told them (but I felt like it would be more awkward if I did? better to just not mention?) but I don't like how they're saying I'm selfish/picking favorites/dividing the girls and that Ivy will be scarred from not being in the wedding when her cousin is. It's obvious to anyone that with one niece I'm guaranteed to have a smiling flower girl and with another niece it's a 50/50 shot."
29,Not the A-hole,AITA for saying that I believe a doctor more than my dad,325,m18wfk,54,"First-time post here and on mobile so the format is bad anyways for context, my parents are divorced and my dad has a disease that increases the number of white blood cells in his body to increase which cause the white blood cells to attack his body (mainly his back) and I a 14F had a back injury a couple of weeks ago where the muscle in my back was torn and hasn’t healed so my doctor suggested that the best course of action was to stay home and rest until it’s healed enough to go to school anyways onto the story. I get a phone call from my dad (same as usual) asking what happened at the doctors and I told him that I got told to stay home and rest and then he said “That’s no excuse to not go to school I swear you teenagers will use any trick in the book to get out of school but that won’t work on me I know what im doing, I know how you feel but I swear that you get this attitude for your mother’s side” which made me a bit shocked and annoyed so I said “Well to be honest dad I would rather believe a doctor who when through ten years of work just be specialised in what he does than you” and this lead on to him yelling at me for ten minutes straight saying things ranging from how I’m never going to amount to anything in life, how the doctor and my mum are fucking idiots and how I’m just gonna be lazy and believe anyone with a slip of paper, I ended up hanging up which i think was the right this to do in the situtation but some of my family think I'm in the wrong and was rude for hanging up and disrepecting my dad but others think I'm right so Reddit AITA?

30,Not the A-hole,AITA for gettting mad at my husband for having a WhatsApp group named after a bullied girl coworker?,2287,m0z6xz,278,"This is my first post ever and English is not my native language , sorry if I don't explain myself correctly.I'm 29F Husband is 32MGirl coworker is 32F. (I'll name her Stacy)We've been married 5 years now and I've always thought that my husband was respectful to women no matter what until this incident . I'm terribly disappointed  and confused,  I'm not sure if I'm overreacting but this situation affected my emotions over him more than I could possibly imagine. My husband and I were chilling,  watching TV,  I was resting my head on his arm when I started feeling over and over again his smartwatch vibrating on me. It was difficult not to look at the notifications he was receiving,  I tried to ignore it a few times but the messages were unending so I couldn't avoid reading that they were from a WhatsApp chat group named something like ""The fathers of ... ""  I laughed and asked him what was that group about , he showed me the complete name of the group ""The fathers of Stacy's daughter "" and explained that they have a pregnant coworker that is having a baby girl and the chat was at the beginning some kind of club for bullying Stacy , he implied she deserve it because she has a bad attitude at work and also because she's ugly and fat. He was laughing and telling me how funny that was , expecting me to laugh too but I didn't,  I got mad and told him how disappointed I felt , that I couldn't imagine how must feel if my male coworker would ever make fun of me like that. I tried to explain how childish and stupid he was , he didn't accept it and said that at some point they stopped talking about Stacy's pregnancy and just kept the name of the group because it was funny , he said I was overreacting and that he would never show me anything from his phone ever again ."
31,Not the A-hole,AITA for restarting the internet?,60,m1khmc,53,"Basically my internet has been horrendous on my PC for the last week. I asked my family around 9 PM today if anyone minded me restarting the internet and was met with no’s from everyone. I then said that I would restart it tonight when everyone is asleep and my dad responded with a thumbs up emoji. I then wait till about 12 PM when everyone has gone to bed and go downstairs and turn the internet on and off. I’m suddenly then met with a barrage of texts from my sister asking if I had done something to the internet, which I replied with yes.She then starts calling me a selfish cunt. Apparently because I reset the internet she has now lost a whole days work because she was doing all her work on an online document. If I had any inclination that she was doing so I wouldn’t have gone anywhere near the internet, all she said when I asked about it the first time was that she was watching something. I felt like I made it clear that I was resetting the internet tonight but clearly not so there’s been a major lapse in communication here.What I want to know is, am I the asshole here? And if so how badly? Thanks for any replies in advance.Edit I’ve worded the way everyone said no incorrectly. I meant that everyone said “no do not restart the internet” that is why I waited hours to restart it."
32,Not the A-hole,AITA for making my sister rehome her pet?,557,m14lwr,49,"I recently moved in with my partner which left my flat open.I’ve spoken to my partner in the past about renting it out and we had considered it when my sister decided to leave her boyfriend, she asked to rent the flat and we allowed it.I didn’t want pets in the flat which I told her before we even started the process on anything.She told me the rabbit would be kept in the cage/run at all times and she’d put flooring under the run so nothing got chewed up or ruined and I begrudgingly agreed to THAT.We visited the flat to find that the carpet had been chewed up, the walls had little chew marks on and honestly I think that agreement we had above where the rabbit would be kept in the run/hutch was warning enough that I wouldn’t accept damage.I gave her warning that I would up the price in rent as we had only been charging half of what is normal in the area, I didn’t expect that type of rent that month so I’d given her almost two months warning, at the beginning of next month I was going to give her formal warning.I was open with her and told her it was because of the damage caused by the rabbit and because I don’t believe she would keep to her word.She decided to rehome the rabbit and I told her I’d keep the rent the same.It’s safe to say I’m not on her good side currently and I’m wondering if I’m TA?My family think I should’ve spoken to her or come up with a way for her to keep the rabbit.AITA?"

So, T is 14, she is kinda into that ""not like other girls"" stage, i have never really spent much time with her, i barely saw my dad so imagine.It was hard to bond with T, i'm into makeup, clothes, i even have a tiktok chanel for it and make money with it, T used to say its dumb.Besides the age gap, there's also a language barrier between us (my first language is Spanish and my English isn't great) but recently i was doing my make up at the living room and T liked it. She got curious and i teached her some things. All natural looking make up, i gave her things some brands gave me, she is really good at it! She must wear makeup 3 times a week at most, not for school and all natural looking but when my step mother found out, she got super mad, saying i'm making T grow up too fast and insinuating that she is ugly with no make up, she threw the things away and said i should not impose. She is not talking to me at all now and my dad is on her side. T is upset at both of them.I really don't know who is right. AITA?Edit to add: I don't know if there was a no make up rule"
34,Not the A-hole,Aita for revealing a secret my aunt has hidden from my cousin only cause im changing my last name?,161,m1bxp8,27,"So I (f21) am planning to change my last name to my mothers last name. Have been wanting to do it since I was 14 after I learned how bad of a person my father was. Im currently waiting for the courthouse to be open to public to do it. I recently changed my last name on all social media, as just waiting for the courthouse to open is my last step before I get my ssn changed an other stuff. When my aunt an uncle married, she still had her ex husband's last name, an when my uncle married my aunt, he took her last name, so now he has her ex's last name. He didn't find this out till after their oldest was born.... When my cousin (oldest cousin. F20) messeged me an asked why I was doing it an how girls keep their last names till their married. This happened yesterdayC (cousin): hey, why r u changing ur last name to your moms? You have your dads last name, aren't u supposed to keep it till ur married? Me: because I prefer my mothers last name, an the girl doesn't have to change her name when she get married. Uncle changed it to when he married aunt. C: so? You don't change it before marriage. You change it when you marry or divorce. Me: still not true. You can change it at any time. Plus aunt didnt change her name when she divorced. I guess she didn't know this, as now im getting texts from my aunt an uncle how I shouldn't have been the one who told her an how im a jerk. Honestly, other then the kids, everyone else in the entire family knows. So if my aunt an uncle didnt tell em, someone else would. It just happened to be me who told her. Now they had to tell the younger 1 about this as well. Aita?"
35,Not the A-hole,AITA for making a complaint about someone for calling me sweetheart / their reaction when I told them not to?,1095,m114xi,220,"Throwaway as the friend who called me an asshole knows my main. All this happened under an hour ago, so apologies for errors, I’m pretty flustered. I (27F) was walking down a part of my city that closed to cars, so it’s known for shopping, buskers, and people collecting money for charity. I walked past one particular charity, and there was a group of about 3 men who looked to be in their early 20s collecting money. One of them yelled at me ‘hey sweetheart come over here’. I said ‘don’t call me sweetheart’. He and the group started laughing and asked why, I said it’s patronising. Keep in mind, he yelled at me from quite far away, so I was walking past them without stopping for the whole interaction. They started laughing harder and told me to lighten up. Not my proudest moment, but I gave them the bird (while still walking away). I was pretty angry, I see the term sweetheart (when said to a stranger) as sexist and patronising, and I was angry that I was laughed at when I asked them not to call me sweetheart. I used to do that exact job (for like a month lol), so I know that they are not hired by the charity but a third party marketing company. I even worked for the company that included that charity in its roster. So ten minutes after the interaction I rang the company and put in an offical complaint, and I explained the exact reasons I was angry. They confirmed that they do do the fundraising for that charity still, and that they would look into it. (I was well out of earshot of the group by then).  Having worked there for a whole month, I know it’s unlikely they’ll actually do anything, but maybe things have changed since I was there. I ended up texting a friend to vent a bit, and she said that while she agrees and also hates being called sweetheart by random strangers, it’s not something they could potentially loose their jobs over, which might happen by making a complaint. She also said that I was very rude by giving them the finger.So am I the asshole?Edit for update: thanks to everyone who voted, I’m feeling a lot more comfortable with my decision. Apologies for not responding to comments, I’m an Aussie so I posted, went to bed, and then woke up to this. A couple of points-my friend isn’t a bad person, stop the insults. She has said since she does think they should loose their jobs, but she’s worried that I may be hurt in the future with my habit of talking back. Since our city is small, she’s also worried about them running into me again. - I contacted the charity they work for, they were extremely supportive and angry and gave a full apology and assurance that they will investigate - funnily enough I do actually already annually donate to this charity, so they wouldn’t have gotten anything from me. I won’t be stopping the donations, they do great work and it’s very close to my heart- it was very busy and the middle of the day, otherwise I would not have reacted for safety reasons"
36,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving my 2 month old daughter with her older brother to have a night alone with my husband?,119,m1cxzi,93,"Sorry if I didn't explain myself well, he's her half brother, he and his brothers (24M, 19M, 14M) are only my husband's children, not mine (and how could I be their mom if I'm only a few years older than them? lol) I (27F) know it may sound bad, but her brother is 26 and he and his girlfriend (25F) offered to take care of her so that my husband (50M) and I could spend a night alone, and I accepted because they work with children and I knew that she would be safe with them.My youngest stepson (14M) went to his mom's house on saturday so we decided to leave our daughter at his older brother's house that day and spend that night alone. And I'm not gonna lie I felt really guilty for leaving her, but my husband and I had hardly any intimacy since she was born (she's almost three months old) and we needed a day off.We left her at her brother's house around 7 pm and picked her up at 8 am the next day, and she was perfect. During the night her brother sent us videos and pictures of her to let us know that she was okay and that made me feel a little bit better because honestly I felt guilty for leaving her with them all night.But the guilt came back this morning when my mom (65F) came to our house and found out that we had left her at her brother's house. She got mad at me and my husband, she told me that she is still too small to spend the whole night away from her parents, that we could have waited a little longer to have s ex, that we shouldn't have behaved like hormonal teenagers. That that's not how real moms act, my husband told her that she shouldn't say those things because I'm a good mom and that I deserved a night off but she just said good moms don't do what I did.And even though I feel a little bit guilty I don't think that makes me an asshole because my husband and I deserved that night off, but she insists that what we did is wrong, AITA?"
37,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my own mother for a source on an extraordinary claim she made?,143,m1artc,87,"We were having a conversation, and it came somehow to the history of video games. She claimed, back in the day, people used to think that because you could die and come back in a video game, you could die and come back in real life. I just asked for a source on that, because all of the crazy stuff I’ve heard people used to believe, I hadn’t heard that. Really into the history of gaming so very relevant.She says I should believe her because she’s my mom, and not to question it. Am I the asshole for asking for a source?"
38,Not the A-hole,AITA Uninvited sister (MOH) after she had a family member text me that she can’t be the MOH.,63,m1g3ka,43,"My maid of honor (sister) bailed on me through another family memberI got engaged last summer and asked my sister to be my maid of honor and her 3 kids to be apart of the wedding party as well. She was excited and said yes. A couple months later she quit her job with no other job in sight. She called and said she can’t be the maid of honor because she just quit her job. I told her that I wouldn’t mind paying for her dress, bridal shower and she can stay at my house to save money on a hotel the weekend of the wedding. My parents offered to pay for her kids outfits and rent a van so she didn’t have to pay for gas and tolls and our cousin offered to pay for her kids hairstyles. She was perfectly fine with this and we proceeded. I bought her the first dress and had it directly mailed to her. She said the dress didn’t work so, she kept it and I told her I’d buy a different one. She agreed. Fast forward to last week, she decided to have our cousin text me to say she cannot be in the wedding because she can’t afford it. My first thought was why couldn’t she tell me herself and how can’t she afford a wedding she basically only needed to show up to? I texted her and asked her why she didn’t tell me herself and if this means she wasn’t coming at all. She never really gave me an explanation. So I waited a couple days and asked again. She said, only she would not be in the wedding due to finances. So I asked her what was burdensome when everyone was paying for her and the kids? I also asked her why she never contacted me herself and why hasn’t she apologized for having someone else relay the message? She told me she doesn’t owe me an apology, she did nothing wrong and I need to stop feeling sorry for myself. She said I’m using the family for money and making them broke for my extravagant wedding just so I can fill seats. My parents aren’t paying for any part of my wedding. My fiancé and I are paying for it. It’s a small intimate wedding of 60 people and under $6k. She then told me I need to see the bigger picture and stop thinking about myself. I decided that she no longer is invited and took her off my guest list. It’s unfortunate because I hated to uninvited my nieces and nephew but, I refuse to pay for one more thing for her. Am I the asshole?"
39,Not the A-hole,AITA for embarrassing my husband by leaving my party and going home?,3883,m0sbv1,632,"Last Saturday my husband and eight of our friends went to a local pub to celebrate my 40th birthday. Restrictions where I live are loosened so we thought we would go and have a nice meal and chat with friends that we haven't been able to spend time with in over a year.I am very introverted and shy. I do not like large groups of people, and I start getting anxious and have trouble breathing in very loud environments. My husband knows this, and is aware of this, and has been throughout the entirety of our 18 year marriage.When we go to the restaurant he was acting very odd, I just chalked it up to it being our first time in a restaurant in over a year. Right after we finished eating he excused himself to go to the restroom. About five minutes later he returns with a giant balloon bouquet, a cake and a line of wait staff behind him clapping and singing. All of our friends at the table were recording me on their phones, people at other tables were clapping and all I wanted to do was crawl under the table and hide. The noise was unbearable to me, I started sweating and shaking and couldn't breathe so I excused myself from the table and left the restaurant.I took an uber home and left my husband at the restaurant (he drove his car), with everyone else. When I got home, I just laid in the bed and cried. I felt humiliated.He came home an hour later yelling at me and accusing me of embarrassing him. I yelled back that he knew I do not like things like that, and he knows how I feel about it. I told him that he completely humiliated me in front of all of our friends and complete strangers. He said that it was my 40th birthday and I should be grateful to him for planning such an event.I told him I was not grateful, that he did not consider my feelings at all, and that he truly betrayed me by doing this. He is currently not speaking to me, he says that I need to send an apology text to all of our friends and make things right. He also says that he will not speak to me until I apologize to him for making a scene at the restaurant.AITA for leaving the restaurant and embarrassing him?**Edit**Thank you for all of your replies. I appreciate everyone of you for commenting and giving such thoughtful and kind advice. Even the people calling me an AH, I appreciate your honesty.I just wanted to say that I have been diagnosed with anxiety. I’ve also been diagnosed with ptsd. This is from a abusive childhood. I have been in therapy for 22 years and my husband is well aware of my diagnoses and also my triggers. He comes to counseling with me once a month. We did speak a little while ago and he did apologize. He said he wanted to do something nice for me and was hurt that it didn’t go like he planned. I told him that what he did was not okay and it really hurt me that I trusted him and thought he understood how I would feel about something like this. I told him he tricked me into thinking it was a meal with friends and it was a terrible thing to do. My friends know that I have anxiety but not how bad. This was the first time they ever saw me have an anxiety attack."
40,Not the A-hole,AITA for potentially blacklisting an applicant to my sport?,182,m17jzp,29,"I (17F) have known Bella (also 17F) for 4 years as we were in the same extracurricular in our old school (also a sport). I do not have a good relationship with her at all. I dislike that she nit picked everyone’s performance during training, even though she can’t execute techniques properly herself. Besides being hypocritical, she is a thick-skinned narcissist. If she sees some of us going out for lunch, she will invite herself along and keep talking about herself, so we have learned how to avoid her or ditch her if she’s incoming.Bella and I applied to my current extra curricular on the same day. I got in, and she didn’t. I have been going for trainings with the rest of my team, and although they are in the year ahead, I feel comfortable with most of them.Because I was accepted early, teammates from my year only started trickling in early March. I like everyone that has been accepted, and I feel like a mother hen because I’ve been organizing them and answering their questions.Yesterday, Bella showed up for trials. Apparently she had been rejected everywhere she applied to, and she was allowed a second chance to apply. I talked to her and found out she was so confident in her skills that she didn’t apply anywhere except my sport. After 4 years in the same extra curricular with her, I was terrified she was gonna join my sport. The captain noticed I looked worried and sad, much unlike my usual self. I talked to her about it, and mentioned what I said in the post. The captain told me not to worry about it, because ultimately the decision is up to our coach. I spent the whole night worrying the Bella got into my safe space, but as it turns out, she got rejected again. I told my friends about the incident today. I was so relieved Bella didn’t get in. Someone said I was an AH because what I said to Bella might have impacted the coach’s decision, especially since I am in a team sport which requires everyone to get on well. She said it was mean to do something that could impact Bella’s chances to get in, especially since she placed all her hopes on my sport.Someone else pointed out that since Bella got rejected once already, and it makes sense that she got rejected again. She thinks if Bella could get in, it is unlikely that one person’s dislike of her would affect her ability to get in. I’m also not sure if the captain said anything to the coach about what I said, because I am not that significant.AITA for voicing my dislike about Bella to my sport’s captain during her trial?"
41,Not the A-hole,AITA for how I stopped my roommate from eating my food?,498,m12k2s,88,"This is honestly such a small and petty thing, and it happened months ago, but I was reminded of it recently and I never got clarity on who was in the right here.A while back I was stressed out from online classes and a test I had coming up, so K decided I would treat myself by making biscuits. It didn’t take a ton of effort, other than going to the store, since I just used a can. Still, I hyped them up in my mind while they were baking for 30 minutes and was really looking forward to them as my one thing to make my day better. At the time I had also been counting my calories so it really did feel like something special.I let my roommates know that I was making them and that they could have some from the tray. I then got ready to relax, made myself some tea, buttered a fresh biscuit to my liking, added honey, and sat down ready to enjoy one. My roommate then enters the kitchen, looks at the biscuits, and grabs the biscuit from my plate and takes a bite out of it. She proceeds to put it back on the plate and say, “that was really good.”I pointed to the ENTIRE TRAY of biscuits that was on the kitchen table and said, “they are, you can have some from that tray.”She responds, “i’m gonna have some more” and grabs mine from my plate again.This is where I may have gone too far, as I physically stopped her from eating it by grabbing her wrist, and said “please don’t, there’s a whole tray you can have from instead of mine.”I will note that despite my saying “please”, I’m pretty sure my tone was fairly aggressive. My roommate then put the biscuit back and without saying another word went into her room and slammed the door. My other roommate was witness to this and assured me she overreacted.Later that day I saw her make a post online about being upset and then respond to it an hour later with “turns out i was just hungry lol.”I assumed she realized she overreacted and was over it. About a month later though, on a call with some friends, she referenced that incident as “one I ate a biscuit and [OP] got really mad at me.”That’s not how I would describe the events at all, and I was honestly shocked that she still thinks she was in the right in this situation. I know this whole thing is so small and ridiculous, but I seriously can’t get over it because I was sure I was in the right there, as she literally took food from my plate (twice) when there was a whole tray of the same food she could’ve taken from.The one thing I’ll give in her defense is that I have sometimes shared food with her in the past, so it’s possible that’s why she thought it was okay. AITA?EDIT: Appreciate all the replies, glad to know I’m not crazy for how I reacted. Will definitely work on communicating boundaries in the future."
42,Not the A-hole,WIBTAH If I told my roommate to stop asking for extra things?,46,m1hlzk,16,"I'm on mobile, and I'm a bit new to reddit, sorry! A bit of background my (19F) roommate (19f) and I have an agreement where we both work part time and split chores and bills equally. This is something we've both agreed on for a while and we've had no issues with. She works from home, and I make significantly more than she does. We get along great with no issues.I've mentioned to her that me and my long term partner are starting to save up for a place of our own together. My partner can't just move in with us because they would commute for college and the distance is too far for daily travel. So we want to relocate. Here's the potential issue. My roommate has a habit of asking for small things. She puts a lot of her money into her half of the Bill's since she doesn't make as much, so occasionally I'll buy her little things if she asks for it nicely. (I've never spent more than 20$ at once for her on an item)  but since I've started saving I'm trying to cut back how much impulse spending I do. I've told her this. Sometimes she still asks for things more than the occasional snack or drink on my way home from work. She's been consistently asking for DLCs for her games lately and I keep telling her ""no sorry"" and that's the end of it. But I'm starting to get more and more fed up with it every time she asks. I might be picking up on something that's not there, but it seems like she's started attempting to play it up like 'how nice it would be to own this but it expires this month so oh well I guess. Oh well'  -paraphrasing a text she's sent me about a DLC for a game.TLDR roommate knows I'm saving up money but keeps asking me to buy her things, we both have jobs.WIBTAH if I told her to stop asking me to buy her silly things? Or am I an enabler and I need to stop buying her things entirely? Am I just being overly sensitive?"
43,Not the A-hole,AITA for gamifying our flea infestation?,45,m1gxxv,83,"I live with 6 people and 4 cats. Of the six, five of us are friends. The sixth, Gray, is not. About half of the week, he’s not here. He’s at his girlfriend’s parents’ place. Gray is the owner of one housecat. When he leaves, the cat comes with him.2 months ago, a roommate sees a flea. I text the group chat. Gray, at his partner’s, tells us that he’s been pulling fleas off of his cat for weeks. During that time, the cat had traveled between houses at least 4-5 times. No direct proving where the fleas came from (nor do I really think it matters), but it seems pretty evident that Gray’s cat is ferrying fleas. Fleas can kill kittens (one of the cats is 10 weeks old), and my cat is horribly allergic - when I brushed her, I was pulling bloody bits of dried skin off her. Fleas aren’t something you can go halfway on. There is a whole other household out of my control that needs to be treated. Gray, in a comic twist, lives in the only carpeted room in the house and makes fursuits for a living. The guy is sitting on top of a flea hotel. But he will not comb his cat daily nor invest money in flea treatment. We have offered to help him pay for treatment. We have sat him down and explained that we are worried for the kitten’s safety. He knows my cat is allergic. He won’t commit to anything that requires effort, which flea-eradicating unfortunately has a lot of. He sprayed his carpet once, though commented that he couldn’t get it to spray right. He won’t do treatments at his girlfriend’s place because “her dog is allergic to fleas and we would know if we had them”. Considering his willingness to hide the flea problem from us to begin with, I’m not sure how much I trust him. Yesterday, I pulled 4 live fleas from his cat in under 5 minutes. We can’t effectively treat the house if Gray won’t.At my wits end, I create the Great Flea Off. The Great Flea Off is an excel sheet that tallies the amount of fleas that we’ve pulled off of a cat per day. Whoever’s cat has the least amount of fleas by the end of the month gets a free pizza one automatically goes to the roommate without one for dealing with this). This encourages combing the cats multiple times a day, including the ones that you do not own as to hopefully advantage your cat. It’s a flea penny war.My roommates love it and want to “play”, but we haven’t told Gray. They’re afraid it’s too passive aggressive. He just lost his grandmother yesterday afternoon and it might come across as asshole-ish. I want him to grieve, but this has been a problem long before the passing. I feel as if excluding him is an obvious sign that we think he’s the cause of it. But maybe since we aren’t close to him, it’ll seem more rude than I’m intending it to be. I would be lying if I said I didn’t come up with the idea in a bit of a passive aggressive fit. Would I be an AH for going forward with our game?"
44,Not the A-hole,AITA for me(16M) not wanting to watch my niece(1F),860,m0zn1k,141,"My sister(Mary) had my niece(Grace) in 2019. Mary had a good paying job but got fired because Grace needed speech therapy once a week(she had a lip tie) Mary, until recently, lived in our house with my mom,brother,step dad,and myself so we did what we could since she didn't have the money for an apartment. After Covid hit,the schools in my state closed down early, during that time Mary decided that she needed the money and started job hunting. She was hired at an Applebee's, it doesn't pay good and the hours are terrible. My mom didn't work at the time so she offered to watch Grace. That worked for a while but eventually my mom started going to work with my step dad(he owns a construction company) so we had no one to watch her,until my mom asked me. I was hesitant but I really didn't have much to do since school was out.I worked for my sister and got paid 3.50 an hour(which I know is a terrible pay). I assumed that when school started I wouldn't have to watch Grace. My mom and sister worked so they thought that since I was doing online that I could care for a one year old *and* do classwork. I tried for about a month, during that time I had three meltdowns(crying,screaming,isolating myself). I started getting snappier because of my lack of sleep(Friday's and Saturday's Mary came home at 3 am) and I was worried that because of that I might accidentally hurt Grace. I  asked my mom if I could drop out of school so I could focus on Grace. She was against it because 'colleges won't want someone who dropped out'. I was a little upset that she still wanted me to try and juggle both even though she’s seen my meltdowns. She finally withdrew me. I continued watching her and after about four months Grace had slowly gotten better with speaking so I assumed that my sister would put her into a daycare but no. I finally had enough and told both Mary and my mom that I was done watching Grace. Of course both of them freaked out telling me that I was being selfish. We got into a huge argument and I went to my room crying because I was just completely overwhelmed and they kept putting the blame on me. I ended up staying with my grandma's, which is what I usually do when I get into huge arguments with my mom.Eventually told my mom that I wanted to do a GED course so that I could just get into college. My mom was excited to hear that but asked who was going to watch Grace. I said I couldn't. Again my mom got upset but eventually my sister found someone to watch herA few days ago Mary called on a day i didn't have class, asking if I could watch Grace since her sitter cancelled. I said no because my sister is the type of person to take an inch and make into a mile.After my mom called and asked me to watch her. I snapped and told her no, *again.* She huffed and said that I was self centered.After the call I felt terrible. I'm the bad guy for wanting to focus on school instead of watching a child? AITA?Edit: So a lot of people are confused about Grace's father. He works out of state 90% of the time and Mary really dislikes the man. Another thing is moving in with my grandparents, I can't. My sister moved in with them after my mom started a screaming match and kicked her out. On a nicer note, I am in GED courses and i'm nearly done. I should be in college by next month! "
45,Not the A-hole,AITA for wanting my sister to reimburse me regardless of her financial situation?,47,m1fnuh,43,"So, my sister (F21) smokes a lot. I (F22) not so much. Because my sister smokes more, she often ends up asking for some of mine. I never have any problem with that because she is the one who usually picks it up, saving me from sorting it out.Last year my sister and I were living together. I was supporting both us with my social welfare. Recently, I decided to go back to college and so had to start seriously saving. This is easier now that she doesn't live with me. My sister wasn't able to get on social welfare due to technicalities and only has the meagre amount that she gets from our mum to live on.The other day, I accidentally left my hash in her new place. I immediately discovered I had done so, and sent her a message asking to keep it safe for me and not to smoke it. She said that was no problem.I didn't see her for about a week, and unfortunately someone in our extended family passed away. I knew I'd see her at the funeral, so I asked her to bring it (because of COVID, we were sitting in a car watching it as a livestream). When we were sitting in the car, I asked her about it. She then told me she smoked it all well before last night. I was pretty shocked and offended, as I felt that she had betrayed my trust, so I became visibly upset. She explained that she needed it (I know that she has a tendency to self medicate, and we both suffer with anxiety). We started to fight and I ended up calling her a selfish bitch - sister stuff. I laid off when I saw she was upset. She offered me some weed as a replacement, but I don't smoke weed as it exasperates my anxiety. I asked her to pay me back instead.She then stopped replying to me. I let my sister know that I was considering going through our mum (she know's that we smoke so it wouldn't be revelatory or punishable). She is working for her doing odd jobs. I thought I could get the money from her wage, with my sister's permission.I then receive this text from her today:'*I’m not giving you 20...you get 300 a week\*. 10x more than me.. I ended up offering you the equal amount in weed, which any reasonable person would have accepted. Instead you called me a bitch and now you’re hounding me for more than it was worth. Im upset that you threatened to go thru mum for 20 as if she doesn’t have enough shit to deal with right now! You’d rather make this everyone’s issue but your own, instead of just getting yourself a bag. That just goes to show how little you consider anyone but yourself.'*\*I do not get 300 a week, I get 200 and it's taxed.From the get go she felt justified in not paying me back. Should I just let her not repay me in anyway?tldr: My sister won't replace my hash which she smoked because I make somewhat more money then she does. Am I the asshole for thinking that this is a betrayal of my trust in her?edit: Some people have raised alarms about my welfare. I am not trying to fleece the government, I lost my job due to COVID (service industry) and I am receiving a stipend based on my years of work history. Hoping to return to employment as soon as I am legally allowed.  "
46,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I come out earlier than my parents want?,22,m1ku8l,15,"TLDR at the bottom. Sorry for long read and sorry for formatting issues, I’m on my phone.So as a context, I (16M) am not white and neither is my family. My parents are from a third world country and I to was born there but only spent a few years there. They are both very religious but my religion is based around an individual’s choices and my parents are kinda open-minded. I was very surprised when they accepted me as I was expecting the worst.My dad found out after he got tired of me being so secretive about my phone which had my secret gay insta, and he agreed to keep it quiet as long as I told my mom and didn’t let “my choice and backwards approach to sexuality and gender” affect my grades. I’m paraphrasing here but that’s what it felt like. I realised this during quarantine around Easter, almost a year ago.Anyways going off on a tangent aside, I told my mom in October, but not before telling all my close friends first. Side note: I had told a friend first cause I do NOT trust my parents that much.Both of their reactions were like “Are you sure, it could just be a phase...” and “When I was your age, I was confused about this too.” and “It’s just a choice.” Now I’m not going to go into how dumb that is and and how wrong it is to say that and how confused might actually be denied bisexuality.My dad didn’t care at all to whom I came out to, as long as I wasn’t rushing it. He respected my choice but would hope for me to ‘grow up’ and ‘be normal’. My mom in the other hand straight up said “NO. You’re not coming out now, and not until after sophomore year of University as you need to focus on out studies. Also, you are not coming out right now as think of all the bullying from the community well received and think about how hard this’ll make your sisters life!” Now I get her concerns, the community has been known to be super toxic to almost everyone, but I don’t get why I can’t life my life the way I want to.I’ve told them before that when I realised after years of denial, and up to that point, I was sad (I want to say depressed but it wasn’t clinically diagnosed.) and when I realised that I was gay, I was going to look at conversion therapy. My parents then asked me about conversion therapy, to which they said “Why not try it out?”. I can’t deal with how wrong that was, especially when the entire goddamn internet says otherwise.I am TIRED of hiding and I want to be free.So Dear Reddit, WIBTA?TLDR: look at the question."
47,Not the A-hole,AITA for no longer wanting to help my sister/her boyfriend but will help my nephew?,185,m153cu,47,"So my nephew just turned 1My sister is a choosing beggar basically.Her boyfriend was in a custody battle with his ex-wife, he needed a car to carry his two kids to her, I literally went out, bought him a car and fixed it so he could have his kids.Not good enough. They wanted a nicer car, handed it back to me because it wasn't ""cool"" and they got themselves an imported Van that was ""cool""They had an utter shit couch, it was horrible to visit and I'd always leave with back pain from sitting on their shitty half reclined futon thing.So, $600 later I got her a new couch, she loves it, but not the colour. It's grey, she wanted blue (to note, their house is basically a thrift store, there's no theme, nothing matches)I went and got a child seat so me and my wife can babysit the nephew, it's not ""fancy"" enough (the one my sister has came with speakers and stuff)At this point I'm just like ""Nope, if I buy anything else for her, it's actually for my nephew, like books, clothes, toys, stuff that will help him grow and develop""My parents are on my side, my grandmother thinks I'm am arsehole.So, AITA?"
48,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my partner's mom to leave my toddler be,333,m12dqs,197,"My partner and I are separated but for convenience I just refer to him as my partner. He lives in his mom's house where my toddler spends abt 50% of his time. My parenting style is to treat my child as his own person, and that includes respecting when he says no. My partner's family has had difficulty with this concept and this has been a source of conflicts as I will ask my partner to educate his family why they should not forcibly kiss/hug my son when my son has clearly said no. My son frequently ends up screaming/crying at my partner's family events. So that's the first impression that my child has of my partner's family.The incident: I'd spent the morning at my partner's home taking care of my son with no help from my partner who was busy. He needed me to urgently clear something so I finally found some time to do it because my son decided to occupy himself. At this point my partner's aunt and mom come home with my partner's cousin who was here to visit. I say hi and go back to the room. My partner's mom starts calling out for my son to come greet the cousin. She yells ~10 times before asking me where he is. I reply ""he's over there but if he's doing his own thing please don't call him"". She says ""what's that?"" Here, my partner comes in to say ""it's OK if he's playing by himself don't disturb him""She leaves, my partner closes the door to ask me why I had to sound so rude. I'm surprised but not very, since he frequently thinks that. Some context: his mom and I are not on good terms, I avoid speaking to her other than saying hi and bye. I use an overly polite tone with strangers but since my partner's mom treats me like air I find it quite tiring to sound friendly with her, so I sound neutral as normal people would speak to other normal people that they're on a hi bye basis with. I didn't think my tone was bad but my partner insists it was (which I KNOW for a fact wasn't, for 1 the door was open, my partner was nearby, I'm 6mths pregnant I rly am in no state to start a fight). I disagree that I was rude, and ask my partner how else would he rather I have said it? My son then starts crying for his dad to open the room door so clearly he's aware of his surroundings. He isn't deaf, he just chose to ignore his grandma. This is where our conversation ends because my partner starts screaming at my son to shut up. I immediately leave w my son. We continued over text where he claims that I could have said, and I quote him, ""*his mom's name*, maybe don't disturb him"" Which I don't find it sounds any better from what I said, I even used the word please. But he insists that my tone was terrible so maybe he is just annoyed that I dared to speak to his mom and suggest she stop doing something. He texted me this morning to tell me he never wants me in his home ever again and that everyone present that day thought I was ""incredibly rude for speaking to the owner of the home that way and it is basic manners to pay respect to elders and to greet them"""
49,Not the A-hole,AITA for choosing my fish over my sister and parents,5357,m0mdi8,596,"My parents were not nice to me growing up. They fed me and gave me a roof over my head but that's about it. I had a lizard when i was a teen and they said that i wasnt helping to do my sisters HW since she was failing her classes so they literally threw my lizard away and that's the main reason i cant stand them. Anyways when i became 18 i moved out and went NC. I am now in my late twenties and engaged but my husband/long-term fiance and i have a lot of aquariums in our house and have our entire basement dedicated to fish and we are in the middle of building a pond. My sister was a brat growing up so i dont talk to her as well but maybe the occasional happy birthday, merry christmas or check up on her but that's it. My sister got divorced (she married at 17) and then moved back in with our parents but they are having a hard time paying the bills because of COVID and an extra mouth to feed. My parents quit their jobs to deal with her and want to move into my home. I told them to shove it after what they did to my lizard and that they can be homeless for all i care. I posted progress of my pond and aquariums on facebook and my sister called me and said i was so selfish to put their lives above mine and that i am flaunting my wealth and my mum said she gave birth to me and that i am spoiled. Technically we could re-home the fish so they could live here since the basement has two bedrooms with bathrooms but they are filled with fish and i think that is too much hassle for two family members i don't even like. My husband said the homeless comment was too far AITA?"
50,Not the A-hole,AITA siding with my son about his piercings?,1120,m0vds2,212,"(please excuse my terrible knowledge of piercings beyond lobe piercings, hope I made it make sense)So my (46M) son (18M) moved out shortly after turning 17, he did not get along with his mom and he didn't want to live with her anymore. I made sure he had enough money for rent and bills and kept in contact with him.I haven't actually seen him for over a year, almost two. now that restrictions have been partially lifted I invited him to visit and he accepted. when he left home he was actually the only person in our house that had never gotten a piercing. both our daughters have their ears pierced (11F, 15F), my wife used to have a navel piercing (now healed) and I used to have one of my ears pierced (now healed)when my son arrived it was like looking at a different person (but in a good way), he looked happier than I think I've ever seen him. he also now had a few piercings and some tattoos. he has a lip piercing, both lobes pierced, a few cartilage piercings on one ear, and (the thing that my wife took issue with) a microdermal piercing near his left eye/cheekbone (a piercing where one end is embedded in the skin).I sat and talked to my son for a bit, he talked to his siblings, we talked about how he's doing at uni, how his boyfriends are doing, etc. then my wife got home and shit his the fan. at first she was like 'who tf is that' and then freaked when I told her that it was our son. she told him to either take out his piercings or leave he went to take out his lope ones but she told him to take out the microdermal first. he explained that he kinda cant remove that one, so she kicked him out.I asked her why she did that and it devolved into an argument about me 'condoning his lifestyle' and how she doesn't want someone like that around and influencing our daughters. she thinks he's TA for not informing us that he 'looked like that' and she thinks I'm TA for letting him in even after I saw what he looks like. shes now saying that we need to be a united front for our kids and blames me for the fight.I think I'm TA because I let him in knowing she wouldn't like it (i let him in because I invited him, I didn't do this to spite my wife, I just knew, after seeing my son' piercings, that she wouldn't like it) so AITA? should I have taken him elsewhere or handled this in private?"
51,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting pissed off at my wife for how much she spent on her nipple piercing?,3476,m0nluu,583,"A few months ago my (31M) wife (26F) got one of her nipples pierced. At first she just had a barbell with metal beads, but the other day she got an upgrade.Not long after I got home from work she told me she'd got some new beads for it. She showed me it and I saw two diamonds on it. I asked her if the diamonds were real and she confirmed they are. When I asked how much she paid she said $3800. I could not believe it.At this point I got extremely pissed off. I basically told her that I thought spending that amount of money, especially on something that except me, the doctor and a few of her girl friends is going to even see, was incredibly irresponsible. I also thought that she could've at least consulted me before spending a sum like that (I don't think I would spend more than $250 without consulting her).She basically said that I was overreacting. She said she just sees it as her getting something nice for herself once in a while and doesn't care that nobody else will even see it. She also pointed out that she's not brought us into debt or anything over it and that we are doing pretty well financially.She kinda has a point. We've actually fared pretty well financially despite everything that's happened so it's not going to break the bank and she's normally pretty good with money. But at the same time I still think she was out of line to splurge so much without even giving me a heads up. And I still think there's better uses of $3800 than a piercing.Edit: just to clarify, she took it from the joint account"
52,Not the A-hole,AITA For expecting my brother to pay me the same percentage as I payed him when i sold my PC.,19,m1jl7f,13,"A couple of weeks ago i found a PC for very cheap that i sold for a big chunk of profit, i bought it for 100 bucks and after fixing it sold it for 500. My brother did nothing yet i was forced to pay him 40 bucks by my parents. I dont understand why, i took all risk and did all the work but whatever i thought. I didnt wanna pay him but he told me if he ever sold a PC he would give me the same percentage. Now he is selling his own PC for 1500 bucks and told he would only pay me 40 bucks. Is it wrong of me to demand the same percentage of pay as he did? I even offered him a good offer, he planned to sell the pc with his monitor so i told him we could switch monitors and i would even pay him 50 bucks for it. Thing is this trade would not decrease the overall sale anyways so it should only be profit for him.  He declined and said my monitor is shit even though he literally sold me it a year ago.  Time and time again my brother is just using me for his own gain it feels like. Im not sure what to do. Anyways, am i the asshole?"
53,Not the A-hole,AITA for not speaking up about my boss's homophobia?,1991,m0qv9g,181,"Hi, y'all. I (20nb) work for a very polite woman (30-ish) as a nanny. I adore the job and all that comes with it. The pay isn't the \*best\*, but her relaxed approach to parenting and not minding me being on my phone when the baby is asleep makes it an incredible job. She is a lovely and kind woman who, up until recently, I thought was a very open minded individual.I recently was watching the baby when when my boss's MIL came by to visit and chat. My boss has more children than just the baby I nanny. Her middle child stays with the MIL in the afternoons for online learning reasons to my knowledge. MIL came by and brought the kiddo along with her. The kiddo is a super sweet child and very energetic, but because they wanted to relax and I was busy feeding the baby (normally if he's there and I have nothing to do I'll play with him to be nice) they just plopped him on the couch to watch Netflix while they talked. He started watching a show and the MIL turned it off, stating that the characters were gay and that she didn't want Middle Child exposed to that.I was shocked to hear MIL and Boss's conversation take a startling turn towards a homophobic rhetoric, but it wasn't my business. Because I needed to do a background check to be a nanny I just give out my deadname to people I want to work for. I don't mind. When I am able to afford the long process of changing my legal name and everything that involves I'll happily do it. But right now I'm just a nanny. I'm just there to get a check at the end of the day.I told my friends about it when I got home and a lot of them were disgusted by the fact that as a member of the LGBTQ+ community I didn't stick up for myself. My friends, while I love them, are all still in college and many have not had their first job yet. I tried to explain that there's a time and a place to speak up about homophobia, and that was \*certainly\* not the place.They said that by staying silent I was teaching middle child that being homophobic was fine. And I'll admit, I might have been. But I have also casually mentioned my ex girlfriend to him before and when he asked questions I was happy to explain, this was before I learned about my boss's beliefs.I know that it's important to be out and proud, but I enjoy and need this job. I'm just there for a check, not to preach the queer agenda to this family and pray things turn out like a hallmark movie.So, am I the asshole?**Edit 1:** After reading through this I kinda realized that my friends were being assholes for guilting me over just looking out for myself. I had been feeling like I'd outgrown this friend group for a while. They all are going to college on their parent's dime, which honestly? Good for them! But they also have not worked any real jobs. We all came from higher middle class families.I told them that I just couldn't have been an activist in that moment. I have food, rent, and savings to look out for. They all (yes, literally everyone in the group chat) started saying that me compromising my identity was terrible and I *should* be ashamed for hiding the fact I was gay. I told them that we don't live in She-Ra. Homophobia has real consequences and the consequences would have been my livelihood!They all said that they had hated me since I got the job. I used to be the group therapist and I told them they have to stop venting to me during work hours and they all took this as me abandoning them. I told them I'm not being paid to be their therapist, I'm being paid to be a nanny. After that I left the GC.Needless to say, I'm pretty crushed. I don't have any IRL friends and now I won't have any online friends either. I know I'll be ok as long as I keep on moving forward and as long as I keep working. Thanks for all the comments, guys. I hope you all have an incredible day!**Edit 2:** Thank you for the awards, kind redditors!**Edit 3:** I don't know if this is needed, but if someone, for some reason, wants to read this on youtube, it's whatever. Go ahead if you need content. "
54,Not the A-hole,AITA for being angry with my aunt wanting my paystubs?,26,m1gilj,46,"Story Time, I guess. For the next few months and the few before this, I've had to live with my aunt while my roommate-to-be saves up and we can rent an apartment. I try to stay as out of sight and mind as I can but we've still had some... Conflict. Apologies in advance for my pretentious prose, I promise I don't talk like this irl lmao. My problems are:She has made remarks about how I need to, ""stop eating like I'm poor!"" But only gives my half a drawer to keep my food.When I first started living there, she tried to have me call her whenever I left  or arrived at the house/work. She, ""just wanted to know where I was"" I'm 20.She seems disgusted by my lack of career? A la the first point. I have a well paying job with benefits at a warehouse. She gets mad about me having three days off, and me not being a career-man.My warehouse job has shitty management and the lengths of my shifts aren't clear until they're already over. So I'll be scheduled for 10 hrs, probably only work 8-9, but stay in the warehouse for a minimum of 12. I do well for myself, but she doesn't care about *that.* It's all about the hours, babeyyErgo, she implemented an *Interesting* system of rent. Now, I have been asking her from the very beginning if she wanted me to pay rent, but she waved me off until current. The rent is thusly: $100~mon if my hours are exactly 40 or higher. $300~mon if it's below. And she needs to see my paystub. ^ This make me really uncomfortable. It doesn't feel like it's about rent anymore. If feels like *control.* I'd rather pay the higher rent *anyways* hell, I'll pay more than that if she'd accept me keeping my hours and finances to myself. It's like I'm being put under a microscope.(And control has been a weird thing with her. She controls conversations too. She talks *at* me, and if I say anything she nods and carries on like I didn't. Small comments about the weather or a work injury turn into something like an interrogation.)When I bring up that my job doesn't have hour security like that, she tells me to get a different job. Go work at Home Depot, go retroactively have a degree and get a desk job, and most recently: Come work in the exact same building where *I* work.^ I'm only staying with her for a little while, and I *like* my job! I shouldn't have to quit because she it's not up to her personal standards.And lastly, the problem up top. This first month I didn't give her my paystubs exactly. I wrote down my hours and calculated my average hours. Which is all the information she asked for. She got really offended,.and said that I was being disrespectful, because she told me to give her my paystubs and I didn't do it and ask her why she wanted them.Maybe I'm overreacting, and I need to chill the fuck out. There's barely a line about my hours on the stubs, but and awful lot about how much money I have. I feel like she's fishing for my personal information, and trying to puppet me around with monetary incentives.EDIT: I tried setting boundaries. It just made her angrier. :///"

Me and my wife are so happy he’s with her because she’s just very kind and funny, and has become a good friend to us as well as family member, particularly with my wife.She has a high paying job. She live in a nice house, buy nice things, have a nice car etc. My brother has a pretty normal job, he’s not very ambitious and now that he’s with her, he’s content with that (which is totally fine by the way). Jane has told my wife a couple times that she doesn’t mind paying for everything, but that he doesn’t like to talk about it in public, and get defensive if she mentions anything that she bought when friends or family are present, I have noticed this too. Well, my parents got vaccinated so we all went there for dinner. It was a great time. At one point, my dad is taking about finances and saving, etc. And my brother mentions the house “he bought” and the car “he bought”, me and my wife are rolling our eyes, Jane looks a little disgruntled. And then, at one point he says “yes we have a simple relationship with money, I make it, she spends it!” Like a joke, but joking about the wrong thing if that makes sense, because he’s alluding to the fact that this is true. So I say “Luke, that’s a bit unfair. Jane is the bread winner in your household, and she bought the house and car didn’t she?” He laughs and says “no!” So I don’t bother after that.He called me later and blasted me saying it was none of my businesses and so what if she bought those things. I said he should be a little more appreciative and respectful. We haven’t spoken since, and my mum and dad are annoyed that I said it because it made dinner awkward.Edit: Jane appreciated it"
56,Not the A-hole,AITA? I told my dad to eat shit.,20,m1gu2u,22,"I told my dad to eat shit, AITARecently when I've communicated with him, he's been trying to take some serious jabs at me. For example: i cut my hair and showed it to him on Sunday and he called me ugly.He has also called me ugly before when I had some prescription glasses which has really affected me, so to hear this again just brought back a bunch of memories.I've been taking a heavy course load in university and am under a great deal of stress as I'm trying to become an engineer and make my parents proud. With covid, working from home ect it has been different to say the least. Now for the present story. My grandma (dad's mom) dies back in January at age 102. My dad has been alternating funeral dates because of covid, but he came back on his original date, Tuesday next week.I get informed today that I have an exam on Tuesday so I call my mom who has me on speaker and my dad eavesdrops the whole thing. My mom basically asked me in a calm tone if I can ask the teacher to push back the test for me. I then proceed to tell her I attempted this but the prof has not gotten back to me.My dad then comes on the phone screaming and telling me that I'm a fucking asshole and I need to attend this funeral and fuck you fuck this blah blah blah.I hung up on him.He then texts me, calling me an asshole, and that if I continue, 'I'M OUT', what ever that means.I don't think he understands I'm just laying out facts and facing a real problem, test or funeral, he exploded on me like I should already know which option to take. I seriously think this guy just has a jealously problem with me because he gets ANGRY and LASHES OUT AT ME for some of the most small and petty things.Anyways, after he told me I'm an asshole and that he was basically at his 'wits end' with me. I simply told him to eat shit.I am sick of being screamed at and forced to think in a narrow, useless band because of him. I truly believe if I listened to him on everything I would still get yelled at because well I'm his som and he gets off on feeling superior. I think he's a major power tripper and expects the world to not react to his shenanigans.Anyways, I told him to fucking eat shit and that his useless irrational reactions are going to cause him a great deal of pain. I am sick of needing to pretend that I care about his verbal abuse disguised as advice.AITA? I've been feeling bad for telling my dad to eat shit but I think he's just jealous that I'm 26 and he's 69 and he's just been having fun at making fun of me. It felt really good to tell him that. I apologized afterwards though."
57,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting to pay for my stepchildrens private school?,1232,m0t9q5,236,"I30F have two stepkiddos, both girls aged 9 and 11. They are from my husband's 51M previous marriage. I have been in their lives for over 5 years and we are a happy unit. Husband shares custody 50/50 with his Ex wife who I'll call Candy. When Husband and Candy got a divorce, they agreed to keep the girls in a private catholic school they had been attending since pre-k. Last year, Candy moved to a town 30 minutes away and insisted the girls go to a school closer to her home. We live in a major city so traffic and construction add to this time depending on time of day. Husband and I agreed but insisted we discuss public school options as both children are growing tired of catholic school and have expressed repeated interest in public school. Candy brought up the divorce decree and demanded they go to the catholic school close to her new house and offered to pay full tuition (over 12k). We tried to tell Candy that we needed to agree on what's best for the girls and since her new area has highly rated public schools we will concede the location but insist on a public school or even staying at their old school for another year. She enrolled them in the new catholic school anyway. Today, the school is asking parents for next year's tuition. Candy has asked us to pay for half. I said ""How about none of us pay tuition and the girls go to public school like we discussed last year?"" Not maliciously or in front of the kids. Husband wants to pay just to keep the peace, but I'm not interested in paying tuition for a school I don't like and the girls don't like. AITA?"
58,Not the A-hole,AITA Saying I can't transport my parents to Grandad's funeral?,19,m1gxen,32,"I always tell my parents I Have severe anxiety and so I can't take them on long journeys or serious trips where timing is important because I can't be responsible enough due to anxiety and constantly needing the toilet... If its time sensitive I'm more likely to ruin it. My parents recently have no car, i completely forgot this but my mum has assumed I'll be transporting them around on funeral day. I said to my mum you know I can't do that because I can't be responsible incase I can't get you all the way there or there on time you know that?So i tried to sort another lift and she shouted at me, told me no she doesn't want that and she thought seeing as it's an important day I'd just GET ON WITH IT. She said she's going to be the only one having a very stressful day not anyone else and to stop talking . So i cancelled the plans and said ok its okay don't worry i won't talk about it.Am I the asshole?"
59,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting to pay my partner’s vehicle repair bill?,167,m13107,45,"My partner (31M) and I (28F) have been together 5 years, cohabitating for 2. At the start of the pandemic he quit his job due to stress. I said I understood and would cover our shared costs for as long as needed. Reddit, I feel like I made a mistake. Nearly a year later and he’s still not working. I know his mental health has taken a huge hit, which was part of the reason he quit the job in the first place, but he hasn’t been doing anything to work on that. Nothing I have said or suggested has made any difference there. He also hasn’t taken up a larger share of house chores or done anything to make up for his lack of financial contribution. I feel like I don’t have a partner anymore, I have a dependent. Anyway, recently he damaged his vehicle. It was entirely an accident and just super unlucky. However, he doesn’t have the money to fix it. I said that I would not pay for the repairs but I would loan him the money, seeing as he has repeatedly said he will get a job eventually. He is “gutted” and extremely upset that I wouldn’t just pay for it, claiming that in the past I would have done it no questions asked. That this is the worst thing that’s happened and he hoped I would be more supportive. Honestly, I have paid for a lot of things in the past, or turned them into expensive birthday/christmas gifts, but this time I don’t want to. I want to be saving more money and I’m already putting so much financially into this relationship. I get that it sucks to not have a vehicle but I don’t feel like it’s my responsibility to pay for this (I have my own vehicle and never have or would use his). Reddit, AITA?"
60,Not the A-hole,AITA for not coming out with my cousin when she came out to our family and denying being LGBT+ when pressed by our grandparents?,6171,m0hxro,782,"Keeping this short. Names have been changed for privacy.My (f25) cousin Jessica (f29) came out to our conservative family a bit ago (despite me telling her it was a bad idea) and like I said she was immediately disowned by our family for 'choosing that lifestyle'. I don't agree with them, I'm bi but I can't support myself on my own right now. I live in one of my parents' rental properties and work for my grandparents. We live in an area with a high cost of living. I'd be homeless within a month if I lost my job.After she was disowned she was cut from our grandparents' wills too. She looked to me for support cuz her parents cut her off (they paid part of her rent) and I said I'd help her with it but she wanted me to come out too in a show of solidarity. She said they couldn't cut us both off or they'd never get grandkids (we're the only two 'kids' in the family so without us no grandkids). I told her no cuz I have no doubt they WOULD disown me too and I'd be homeless/jobless. She called me an ahole and said I was abandoning her and turning my back on the lgbt community by lying about being straight just to stay on our homophobic family's good side. She even said I was probably after the full inheritance. I said that wasn't true, I don't care about that but I can't afford to come out or I'd be in an even worse place than her. She hung up and ignored me.Days later I got a bunch of calls from my parents/our grandparents demanding to know if I was 'one of the queers' like Jessica. I was confused (and terrified) but played dumb. I asked what they were talking about and turns out Jessica got into a fight with her parents and said they'd never ever see her future kids but they said they didn't care cuz they'd dote on my kids instead. That's when she blew up and outed me to them, saying they would never get any grandkids. That led them telling my parents who told our grandparents. They all jumped down my throat and I was close to a panic attack so I just lied. Said I wasn't gay and Jessica was just lying to try and make me look bad. It took me an hour of lying and crying to get them to back off. They don't think I'm gay anymore but now Jessica's relationship with our family is worse. I'm the only one who will talk to her and I know it's breaking her heart because she feels so isolated.She says this whole thing is my fault and that I abandoned her for money and she'd have never done this to me if I'd come out. I feel terrible because I feel like she's right? Maybe coming out will force our family to accept her back. But I'm scared. I'm not ready to come out. I don't think I'll ever be while our family is alive. I cannot see them being okay with it and I don't want to be homeless.AITA? I think I might be because I could be the reason Jessica is getting thrown aside like this. My friend says I'm not but I don't know.**Edit Some people were assuming Jessica was a lesbian but she's not. She's Polysexual. I thought I included that in the post but I didn't. Sorry for the confusion!**"

As a thank you, my parents once sent me to her house with a $50 Amazon card as a thank you for her. Girl’s mother tried using the card, only to be told it had been redeemed already. Girls mom called my mom, then me, accusing me of stealing the money, stating things like “well you were the one who brought it over and had access to it, so you must’ve taken it.” My dad looked into the situation and found out the card had been redeemed under a different name, Girl’s name! All this while the girl’s mother is constantly accusing me of stealing the money from this card. We got the money from the card brought back, and put in her account. Later, girl’s mother was making comments again and I took her into a room and told her the account had been under her daughter’s name, and gave her the email it was under, and told her to stop accusing me because I hadn’t done anything and I was tired of hearing it. My mother found out I told girl’s mother and called me a massive asshole, saying that girl’s mother wouldn’t be friends with her anymore or “hug her” when they saw each other in public. She told me I was a horrible daughter. So AITA?"
62,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I refused to eat my mom's cooking?,34,m1cay0,23,"So hello, the title is the short version of it. I'm a 17M and still a student. My family is a bit weird in the sense that only the small branch of my immediate family is overweight. Even in that it only contains me my mom and my dad. My younger brother does not fit that and I'll explain why. My mom usually cooks and nags me about my eating habits and how I will struggle when I go to university. Furthermore she buys an excessive amount of snacks. She buys it for me and my brother and We've both told her we don't want it. We asked to stopped buying them. At one point me and my brother both stopped eating the snacks she brought and she made me eat them since I'm the older brother and I can't let food go to waste I guess? At that time I gave up on it and ate obediently. So anyways I realized that If I keep going the way I am I will eventually get to a point where it will be too hard for me to lose weight. I decided to completely revamp my eating habits forgoing all sweets and excessive food from my diet. I talked to her about it and I've been cooking my own meals everyday to not bother anybody else in my family. The reason is my brother. Though he eats the majority of what my mom makes, he cuts out most of it in favor of meat.I cook for myself making sure to have vegetables in every meal. Simply put I cut out all typically unhealthy foods and my diet has become a small amount of rice with chicken beef, carrots peas, broccoli etc. It has not even been a week since I started and I enjoy this. Not only am I learning to cook for myself I consider it healthy. Everybody in my house does. My friends do too just for the record. Today my mom is banning me from cooking. I asked her a reason and she gave me the reason because ""nobody else does it. We can't cook a family meal and have one person eat something different, it goes against my principles."" Frankly in my mind, this is utter bullshit. She didn't give a crap about the usual diet I eat even though My brother eats 1/4th of what she cooks.And for anybody thinking that maybe money is a problem, apparently not. She herself has stated that the food I cooked is healthy. She agrees that i am eating healthier and that money is not a problem, especially since I'm just using a small amount to cook only for myself. Its a matter of principle and nothing else.Problem now is that I am shit out of luck. Knowing her she'll follow through Unless I do something drastic. Now looking at this from her angle she might be mad because I'm not eating her food? This sounds ridiculous to me but maybe? I really can't see a reason why unless she is serious about the principle maybe I'm too uncaring about principles and traditions but frankly I don't care. I'm not willing to give up like this when I finally started eating well.My conclusion in all this would be to straight up refuse to eat her food. Maybe I eat salads and meat but nothing else. I can't see her being happy about this either. Any thoughts on what I can do?"
63,Not the A-hole,AITA for not joining my friend's self-deprecating habit?,93,m14swm,13,"I (20F) have a friend (24M), who I've been going out with since late 2019, and we have a good relationship. The thing is, he has a lot of self-esteem problems  ( mainly wheight-related) and even had a stomach reduction to get thin, which resulted in him being extremely thin in some parts and having deposits of extra fat in others.  I'm a fat girl and I try really hard to navigate society without breaking because I too have my problems and everybody seems to think its because I'm fat.So yesterday, we were talking normally as we do, and he said ""I took some photos but I'm embarrassed to show you, even though we are intimate"". I said go ahead and he sent me 2 profile (as in sideways) pictures and started to ramble about his double chin, and how ""I barely have a chin, and I invented to be fat"". It's not the first time he said things like that and I got a bit mad, and he said ""you're probably laughing at me, but that's okay"". then I got REALLY mad, and said that he doesn't come to me with these photos to share, to vent, to confide his insecurities, he comes with the hopes that I will join him on roasting himself, in a self-deprecating way. I told him he is creating these things by himself, feeding it and hoping I will agree with him when he comes to me complaining about his body image. I told him he shouldn't be embarrassed, that he needn't do these things and maybe should direct this energy somewhere else. He never responded. so, Am I The Asshole?EDIT: he's not my boyfriend, we are more like friends with benefits"
64,Not the A-hole,AITA for starting a silent neighborhood battle,196,m11kuk,49,"Let me start by saying I know that my initial actions were against the rules, but didn't seem like an AH move at the time.I live in a block of townhouses where most are street fronting, but five of them are only accessible by going down a driveway. The street number of the townhouses accessible only via the driveway is also not visible from the street - the dwellings either side of the driveway display their own street numbers, and visitors are expected to look at each of them and then come to their own conclusion that other dwellings must exist down the driveway. This was already frustrating for us pre-pandemic, but became even more frustrating once we required contactless deliveries and nobody could work out where our house was.As renters, we had no right to do this, but with the cost being a grand total of $12, we bought some numbers from the local hardware store (closely resembling the numbers used on all other townhouses in the group) and placed them on a communal post at the driveway entrance to indicate more townhouses existed down the driveway. We received an uber eats delivery that night that made it to our door step without any intervention from ourselves for the first time ever (happy days!)The next day, the numbers were removed. As we had stuck them on loosely, and there is a school only a few doors down, we assumed they had fallen off and kids had made off with them, so bought some more and stuck them on with better adhesive. Again, an online purchase arrived that afternoon with no treks to the end of the driveway required. The next day the numbers had disappeared again, along with a significant chunk of post that they were adhered to.The post needed to be repaired at great cost to the owner group, which I feel bad about, but the next bit is the interesting bit: after the post was repaired SOMEONE ELSE started putting up house numbers on the post. And whoever has been taking them down, keeps just chiselling bits of post away. The owner group keeps having to pay for repairs, just for people to keep putting house numbers up again. Tonnes of passive aggressive anonymous notes in letter boxes have been sent throughout our group. I feel bad about starting the neighborhood war, and know that technically I had no right to do it - but I don't feel mine was an 'AH' move. I can't even think why someone keeps defacing property like they keep doing. What are people's thoughts?"
65,Not the A-hole,WIBTA If I told my friend her dog shouldn't have puppies.,53,m17vzi,47," Basically as the title says, my best friend has a female dog that she breeds from, last year the dog had about 7 puppies and every single one of them died she's now planning on breeding her again, infact there's a stud lined up for her already despite not having any homes for these pups to go to once they're born, the problem is I want to remind her that all the pups from the last litter died and there's already enough dogs in the shelters as it is, but people have told me that it would be insensitive to bring up as she was upset when they died, ive already her already that it's partially her own fault the previous pups died as they had no vet care and she had no idea how to resuscitate a pup that comes out not breathing, not to mention the fact that one survived for the best of 2 days and had no vet treatment during that time, I really want to say something as I'm quite angry about it all but I've been told it's not my business and she can do as she likes, I suppose they are right but I feel like I should speak up for the puppies sake, and possibly the mother dog who will have no vet care throughout as they can't afford it, personally I don't think she has any business breeding if she can't even afford vet care and I want to say that to her."
66,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my daughter to be tolerant of my Christian-themed decorations?,3091,m0j4rz,1063,"Background information: I (34F) have a 15 year old daughter and two ten year old sons. My husband is deployed. Before anyone asks: yes, we married young, and yes, we were married when I had our daughter.Recently, my daughter (we’ll call her Belle) has gotten into occult. She’s not a satanist, but she does make altars and draw witch-themed art. I can’t say I’m 100% on board, but I know I can’t push Jesus on her. Her faith has to be her own. She still goes to church with us (on Zoom currently), but she puts on a stank face for it.Anyway, I recently got a very pretty wooden cross with hand-painted wildflowers. It was made by a local artist, and she paints only flowers local to our area. Needless to say I love it, and I put it up on our porch. Well, Belle decided to rain on my parade and start whining about it. She said I should take it down, because it’ll give people the wrong impression of her religious beliefs. I told her I liked it, it was my house, and like it or not, she’s living in a Christian household and should be tolerant. I thought that was the end of it, but apparently she went and complained to her friend “Lizzie’s” mom. I ran into Lizzie’s mom at the commissary, and she started telling me some very patronizing stuff about tolerance. I brushed her off to not make a scene, but you can bet I chewed Belle’s butt when I got home. I would usually be fine with Belle confiding in a friends parent about her problems, but this just crossed a line for me. The way I see it, the cross is a non-issue, and Belle should just ignore it. When she has her own house, she can decorate it however she wants, and I won’t say a word. AITA? I’d be especially interested to hear from other parents.Edit to add: I do not make Bella go to church. Church is our “family time,” but I’ve told her that she’s welcome to stop going as long as she picks a different family activity for us all to do together weekly. It can be just about anything (board game, hike, baking cupcakes, whatevs). Bella hasn’t gotten around to choosing something, so she’s still attending church. She doesn’t like it, but it would take literally five minutes of her time to think up an alternative and tell it to me."
67,Not the A-hole,AITA for being protective of my car,18,m1e3lz,22,"Feel free to ask more, details limited bc of 3k limitThis whole thing is silly but w/e- I (22F) have a younger brother, Dave (21M) - at the time all this happened I was about 18 and he was 16. I got my drivers license and shared our family jeep with my mom, while my dad uses his car. About a month in my mom bought herself a new-to-her car and I got the jeep to drive. The condition was that I had to drive my brothers Dave & Adam (16M - about 13 at this time) to their sports and stuff, and my parents would pay my insurance, etc. I paid for gasWhen Dave got his license, we shared the jeep. Dave is GROSS - I would find sweaty socks and food wrappers, and the car smelled. I couldn’t stand sharing with Dave - our schedules always conflicted (my college got out in April so I was working FT and he was in school through end of June). I wanted to buy my own car & had enough saved up to buy an older corolla.My parents said that if I bought my own car I would have to pay for everything, including insurance. I said ok.My parents would still ask me to drive Adam everywhere. I did it a few times to help out, but eventually told my mom that I was frustrated bc I was doing all this while Dave was home, sitting playing video games & they were paying for his insurance & his car - he should be driving Adam as I had to drive both of them when they paid for my stuff. Plus, I was using my gas and putting miles on my car. My mom just brushed me off, going back to asking me at least 3 times a week to drive Adam while Dave stayed at home. When I drove my brothers I had to plan around their schedules.Later Dave’s jeep had to go to the shop and he wanted to go to play a soccer game. My mom suggested he take my car, I said no. I said I would drive Dave to the game on my way to hang out with my friends, but he didn’t like this because it would have him be 20 min early to the game. He said instead he should take my car and I should have a friend pick me up. My parents said that I should let him use it, that it wasn’t fair that he wouldn’t get to go to the game. I said no it’s my carThey told me I was selfish and should “think about my brother”. No one cared when I was putting my time and gas into driving Adam around while Dave was home, & that the car was mine. I know it may be a petty issue. My family thinks I was an AH and that I should’ve just let Dave use the car and shouldn’t be mad about driving Adam around bc “that’s what families do” but I think they treated me and Adam differently, and were unfair to me. Am I the AH?"
68,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my daughter it's her fault she has no pictures of herself?,16523,m0dd2m,2152,"Ok, so I (54f) have 5 kids (3 bio, 2 step). The issue with is with my eldest- Clem who is 26f.The only pictures I have of Clem are from the day she was born to around her 8th birthday but none after that. She would ruin any picture she was in by making funny faces, hiding from the camera, making weird signs with her hands, or by messing with other people. It was like this until she was 12 when she started to straight up refuse. We would tell her to come for the family photo, but she would refuse. We never forced her, but would gently encourage her. She even refused school pictures. I have no pictures of birthdays, graduations, prom photos, holidays or days out with her in them.It broke my heart because I don't have any pictures of her growing up. Family photos look odd, because she's not in them.Clem is 26 now and is pregnant with her first child. She brought her SO over for dinner and after we were looking at photo albums. We got to hers and she saw hers was nearly empty. She asked where all her pictures were and I told her she refused to have any taken. She got all teary-eyed and told me to stop joking. At this point, I'm very annoyed- I tell her I'm not joking and that she did this to herself. I told her if she had swallowed her pride and had even one picture, we wouldn't be like this today. She got angry and thought I had printed out the ones she had messed up.She got super upset and went to sit in the car. The next say (today) I got a few texts from family members calling me an asshole for 'putting her on blast' and humiliating her.AITA?EDIT: Thank you for all your replies! I do want to clear something up:Whilst I agree it was a shitty move not to include goofy or rude pictures, that's not what Clem has an issue with. She's upset that I have no pictures of her from age 12-18 to fill the album with and the few I do have, caused extreme reactions from Clem. I can't fill an album with pictures I never took. That's what she's upset about- not the omission of goofy/rude photos.EDIT 2: To those of you saying 'who cares about rude gestures, or goofy faces': I didn't realise this needed saying, but the family photos weren't just for me- they were for everyone involved (aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents on all sides, etc). I can guarantee none of them want an 8yr old making the 'eat out' gesture in what is meant to be their nice family photo.EDIT 3: It's kind of sad to see so many people assume that because a child has anxiety, that I berate them whenever they mess around when taking a photo. I never yelled at Clem for making silly faces- would simply encourage her to stop and smile, but her rude gestures and faces would ramp up. But I guess that's what you expect on this sub- everyone hates their kids. "
69,Not the A-hole,AITA- I (20f) asked my roommate (19nb) to do a few chores?,35,m19lau,34,"Hi! First-time poster on a throwaway, longtime lurker, on mobile. I (20f) live with two roommates, N(19nb) and A (21f), we met during our freshmen year at college and they're my best friends and I'm so happy that I get to live with them but recently we've been having a few issues that culminated in a fight yesterday. Last semester we started living together, and A and I did almost all the work, all the cleaning, talking with the landlord, or making group meals happened to fall to one of us. It didn't really bother me because I was so happy to be living with my friends that I didn't really care. But then A got a boyfriend, and she's started spending 3-4 nights a week at his house, which is cool! But it means that I spend about half the week being the only person who does anything here.I work, and I'm taking a lot of hard classes this semester, while N is only taking a few classes and doesn't work. I don't know if this is important information for y'all but all of us have mental illnesses. Various ones and at various levels, but I can elaborate more on this if necessary.  For the last few months, like 75% of the work has fallen to me. There are a few chores that really, really bother me when N doesn't help, so I thought it made sense to ask them to help out with just these 3 things since I knew it would lower my stress levels a lot. Yesterday, I asked N ""hey, I've been super stressed out lately, and I know in the past you've mentioned that you can't always easily identify what needs to be done in the apartment. Can I ask you to do a couple of things?"" For reference, I asked them to do the following:1. If the Brita jug in the fridge is empty after they pour their water, can they please refill it so that the next person can get water from the fridge.2. When you bring your dishes into the kitchen, can you check to see if the ones in the dishwasher are dirty and if they are, can you put them in there? 3. If the trashcan is full, please don't just set your trash next to the trashcan. Open another trash bag and tie up the one in the bin so that it can be taken out. This is where I might be the asshole. N said ""you know I have mental illnesses that make taking care of things hard for me sometimes, and these aren't just ""a couple of things"" it's a recurring chore you're asking of me."" and I replied, ""I understand that things can be hard sometimes, and I understand if you're having an off day and something doesn't get done, but I have the same mental illness, and when you don't help and A isn't here I'm forced to put aside my problems and sacrifice my mental health care and I don't think that's fair to me."" After that, they basically said that I'm assuming the state of their mental health and need to leave them alone, and then they went to stay in A's room instead.TLDR: I asked my roommate to do a couple of basic chores in order to make my life a little less stressful, but I might be the asshole because I assumed things about their mental health."
70,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling someone I feel dirty in their house?,2362,m0klrd,387,"My BF (Ex now) doesnt take out trash often enough,  making his place... Smelly. After reminding him a few times,  I brushed it off as just being a guy thing. Not my house,  so it only bothers me while I'm there. One day,  I'm there. I'm sitting on the side of his tub while he shaves and I notice an odd pattern on the bottom of his tub. Its an oval, and a much lighter tan than the splotchy gray on the rest of the tub. I make a joke about how it looks like the only part of his tub that gets clean is where he stands in the shower. He's laughs with a confused smile and says 'How else would it get clean?’'... When you clean it.''It gets clean when you shower,  doesn't it?''Noooo. You know you have to wash your tub,  right?'He mumbled something along the lines of 'not everyone knows that' and 'my mom always took care of the house.' OK... I explain that he has to wash the tub because the scummy run off of his body isn't actually cleaning it. A few days later, a similar topic rolls around while we are taking a walk and it reminds me of his tub. So I ask:'Did you clean your tub yet?’ He makes a bunch of excuses as to why he hasn't done it but by this time,  he has lived in his apartment for 5 months and has never cleaned his tub. I'm getting sort of grossed out especially since there is a visible film of dirt residue on the bottom of his tub.  I'm saved from saying anything as he receives a call from the landlady. He called her earlier that week about the peeling in his,  wait for it... TUB. She asks all the standard questions before getting to the one that made me grin. 'What do you wash your tub with?''... Does everyone do that?'I could hear her through the phone asking if he was serious,  laughing,  and saying that 'yeah,  everyone has to wash their tub.' I cant help it. I burst out laughing. He hangs up,  pretty red in the face,  and turns to go back home. I catch up because I know he's embarrassed. He's actively ignoring me but it wasn't MY fault he told the landlady his business. Low and behold a WEEK later I come by and the tub is STILL a mess. All he has are excuses. Again. He doesn't have time. He doesn't know what to use. He doesn't own any cleaner. I'm disgusted and beyond annoyed at this point. I go to my apartment,  grab the ajax,  come back,  and put it in his hands.'Clean your damn tub. Its disgusting.''Can you stop bringing it up? Its not that big a deal.''Yes,  it is a big deal. I'm not coming back here until its done.''Are you SERIOUS?!’'Yeah, I feel dirty just standing in your house.'And then I leave. He does clean his tub and calls me to tell me so. He then said that I was an AH  because I knew he was embarrassed and still learning. I cant tell him how to feel and maybe I was a bit mean but AITA?Edit: He's 25/26.  This situation took a month before I brought over the cleaner myself. I did explain how to clean the tub. I did not call him scum I called the run off from his shower scummy,  as in a layer of dirt. Which after the water dried,  it was."

He's from Africa and moved in and at first I did not mind at all driving him to get supplies to get settled in. I helped him setup his TV and get some channels for him.The problem is he keeps asking for help and as much as I empathize for him, I did not sign up to be his tour guide. I get it that it's hard to get credit card working, phone and Uber setup and what not in a foreign country, but I lived in this off campus apartment to have my privacy, not help a 40 year old get accustomed to America. Pretty much any time I bump into him I expect him to ask me for help with something, which I am always right. He asked me the other day for help with Powerpoints and finally I just said ""Bro you have Google you have to figure these things out by yourself. I can't keep helping you""He won't talk to me anymore and it's awkward. Is that fucked"
72,Not the A-hole,AITA for staying home?,19,m1df4a,13,"Hi Reddit this is a throwaway account.I (18F) am asthmatic, and I have been having issues breathing, chest pain and dry coughs during these last few days. My mom suggested I go see a doctor as she felt worried.I went to go see the doctor and he said that my sinuses have been causing my chest to close up, but it wasn’t too serious. On the other hand he noticed that I was very anxious due to anxiety, and gave me a few days off and a doctors note for when I should return to school.My mom got angry at me when I told her that I would stay home because of what the doctor said. My mom said I should go to school anyway because she thinks I’m fine. However, I don’t feel good at all.(Also in my country the rules for the virus are more lenient so schools are open)Should I just suck it up and go to school?"
73,Not the A-hole,WIBTA If I asked my roommate if she stole my Adderall prescription,24,m1by1h,28,"I was away for a few days and while I was gone my mom mailed my Adderall prescription. I came back today and there's no sight of it, and I asked my roommate to check the mail while I was gone because it was important. It's been exactly a week, and I know there's the possibility that it was lost in the mail or delayed, but I just haven't had this issue before. She knows I'm on Adderall and has asked to buy it off me before, to which I haven't yet but only because when she asked I was usually out. She's really sweet and I wouldn't think she would do that, but I'm considering all possibilities and just angry right now."
74,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I asked my friend to be polite with my impolite neighbors?,23,m1bc05,17,"I (late-20s) and my partner (also late-20s) just bought our first home! We asked our friend R (mid-20s) to move in with us, too, as they’re in a tight spot, need a place, and we have some space. We’re so excited! We went over this weekend to begin getting things ready to move in, and we asked for R’s help. Our house has a deck that faces the next-door neighbor’s side door. R was out on the deck, when the neighbor’s door opened suddenly, and the neighbor said briskly, “Is this your house?!” R was taken aback, didn’t say anything, and came inside. Don’t blame R for that, it was very impolite.It seems the neighbor may have recognized that though, because R was on the deck a few hours later when the neighbor opened the door again and said, “Hello.” R refused to acknowledge the neighbor this time either, and made a show of ignoring the neighbor, in R’s own words. This, I don’t personally like, nor does my partner.We’re on our 20s, and have a great friend group that likes to get together for parties a few times a year. We’re not super-loud, but the neighbor is elderly, and our parties may be a little loud for their taste. Our house also sits on a narrow street, where parking won’t exactly be easy for gatherings, but not incredibly difficult either. I want us to be in good with all our neighbors, so that if there’s anything bothering them, they feel comfortable saying so to us and coming to an agreement before any authorities are involved. I’ve also read so many neighbor horror stories on here, and since we’re likely going to live next to this neighbor for quite some time, I’d like it to be comfortableSo, WIBTA if I told my friend to stop ignoring the neighbor when they speak, and be base-level polite? I understand the neighbor was impolite first, but I don’t want problems with neighbors, especially considering that we haven’t even met said neighbor. Is it dickish to expect R to “play nice” if the neighbor doesn’t? Am I reading too much into it? Help me out y’all!"
75,Not the A-hole,AITA For not wanting to meet my adopted brother,391,m0w6ug,58,"For context, I'm a 32F and I have not willingly had contact with my biological father since I was 14. We live in the same city, but after my parents divorced in my early teens, I cut him off due to abusive, manipulative behavior. This behavior existed throughout my childhood and I have a lot of trauma as a result of it, which has led to a lot of therapy.My younger brother has kept up with our biological father over the years and not long after I cut him out of my life, my biological father remarried and adopted a baby boy. I have never met this adopted brother and really don't consider him a brother at all. To be clear, I don't have any anger or malice toward him, I just don't have anything. Today, my biological brother approached me to say that this adopted brother is older now and wants to meet me. He was very upset when I indicated that I do not want this. He thinks I'm hurting the kid, when in reality I think it's strange that anyone even talked to him about me enough that he would want to meet me. If it's my biological father doing it, then I feel like he's been promoting an idealized version of me as he has no way of knowing me at this point in my life. If it's my brother doing it, then I think it's ridiculous that he is blaming me for a situation he created.This has spread throughout my family and now everyone is mad at me and thinks I'm an asshole. So, I'm asking here: Am I the asshole?"
76,Not the A-hole,AITA for not doing what my friend wants,40,m177p5,33,"(sorry for poor grammer english isnt my native language)so this started a few days ago when my friend started forcing me to do stuff i dont want.Basically it would start off like little things eg: go get me that, give me that or else and shit like that  then it went to more “stuff” like: send pictures, answer me back bitch and if we are ever on a discord chat he will just boot me off the room and not drag me back we have a whatsapp group on our phones and hes made it so only admins can speak and he would get rid of my admin ( basically muting me ) i feel bad because i dont give him what he wants and i feel as if all the things that he does is just revenge for my selfish behaviour"
77,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my boyfriend he’ll fail university,69,m141dy,54,"Mandatory apology for being on mobile.Long story short, my boyfriend has barely done any work for university in the past 2 years. As far as I know he passed maybe 3-4 exams. Contrary to that, I’m nearly done with my bachelor’s degree even though we had approximately the same amount of ECTS points when we met. (For non-europeans, you pass your exams/courses and you get a set number of points for them. A bachelor’s degree is worth 180 ECTS points.)Some context:Am I the most dedicated student? Hell no! But at the end of the day I get my shit done. I’ll stay up all night to study for an exam if I have to since I absolutely hate failing. Our lives changed drastically a while ago when we adopted a dog, which resulted in me struggling with my exams and I failed at least one of them (I’m still waiting for one more grade to know whether I passed or not). That is entirely my fault for not realising in time that I can’t pull my all-nighters anymore since I have another living creature to take care of which also exhausts me a lot more physically. Failing these exams fortunately doesn’t set me back, I can re-take them in May. This hasn’t really happened to me before and I do feel bad about failing but there is nothing I can do about it and hey now I know better.My boyfriend’s lectures take place early in the morning, mostly around 8am. Mine are in the late afternoon/evening time. He is one of those people that need 100000 alarms to wake up. No judgement here, and I wouldn’t mind waking up that early because of his alarms since I have to take the dog out anyway, but after going through I don’t even know how many alarms he still doesn’t get up.It is only the beginning of the new semester and he woke me up that early multiple days in a row for no reason because instead of attending the lecture, he fell straight back to sleep. I did get really pissed today because he did the same exact thing last semester, and the semester before that. He always says that he’ll do better this time and attend his lectures and pass his exams etc etc etc. but quite frankly, I don’t think he ever will at this point.As I said, I got really pissed at him and asked him if he’ll even attend any lectures today to which he started screaming at me saying that I better start studying for my exams now so I won’t fail next time round. This is where I think I’m the asshole because I told him rather harshly that he will never get a degree if he keeps this attitude of not doing anything for uni.So, dear reddit people, AITA?"
78,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my brother I won't stop supporting and being there for my nephews?,2513,m0if3z,220,"So my brother has two sons from his first marriage who are 16m and 14m. My brothers first wife/their mom died a decade ago and he remarried 8 years ago. The boys have pretty much never accepted his wife as their mom. I don't believe they treated her badly but they didn't treat her how my brother and his wife wanted her to be treated. They wanted their dad for everything, wanted him to keep bringing them to school, wanted him for bed time and stuff like that. The oldest would especially ask for that. And my brother would always say he couldn't but their stepmom would. It got to the point where after three years and when my younger nephew told them she wasn't his mom age 8, after two years of them being married, they got the boys counselling and started family therapy. Nothing changed. They had two kids together. Nothing changed. The boys are much closer to each other than their younger siblings. I honestly don't know that they interact with the littles at all.It got bad several months ago. They were doing virtual sessions where the therapist was trying to help them set boundaries with my brother and sister in law when my younger nephew said something that changed things. The therapist was asking him to say something along the lines of ""stepmom, I love you and I appreciate you but I don't want to call you mom because I feel like that is something special for my mom"". My nephew said no and when asked why he said it would be a lie because he doesn't love her. My older nephew chimed in saying he felt the same and ever since my brother has been pissed and the boys have been treated different by them. Neither mind. Which drives my brother and sister in law crazy. My brother had the attitude if they didn't appreciate what she did then they could take care of more for themselves, but both seem to be thriving with it and not missing her.I don't like it and nothing has changed with my nephews. They have opened up to me about how they just never grew to love her. My older nephew said it's not that he doesn't appreciate her trying and being nice but he just doesn't love her and they both admitted had the marriage failed (which it almost did pre lockdown) then they would have chosen not to see her on a regular basis and would not have wanted her in their lives really.My brother is pissed that I am still close to the boys and treating them as normal. He told me they believe treating their mom this way is okay because I have no problem with it. I told him he can't force them to feel a certain way and I certainly wasn't going to punish them for being honest in therapy.A friend told me that the boys have been really unfair and they feel supported and validated in treating my sister in law like shit and maybe I should follow their lead for a while.What do y'all think? Am I wrong here?AITA?"
79,Not the A-hole,AITA for not making my bf apologize to my mom & sister?,7568,m0ds49,744,"**Update:** Wow! I did not expect this much support :) After reading your comments and a long talk with the bf, I decided I needed to cut ties with mom & and Jen. In fact, he pointed out that if we had kids, the mistreatment could extend to them as well and that settled it for me. I blocked them both and sure enough, relatives were calling/harassing me left, right & center. I blocked all of them too except an aunt and two cousins who actually took time to listen to me and apologized. Honestly I've never felt this scared but happy in my life. I am literally shaking as I type this. Thank you guys so much! Had I not gotten such overwhelmingly amazing support on here, I might not have taken this step!So I was talking on zoom to my mom & sister Jen (fake name). At one point, my bf came in & handed me some tea as I had killer menstrual cramps and tea helps. When Jen saw this, she said my bf's actions were ""offensive to women"" and treating me like a fragile princess was enabling me. She said her husband doesn't help her whether she's well or sick and that's how a partnership between equals works.This made me mad. My bf is a sweetheart and he understands that this time can be painful for me, so he helps out in whatever way he can. I told Jen that when I'm well, I take care of him as well - pack his lunch (his office has reopened, but my college classes are still online), make him breakfast etc. She got even more angry and congratulated me for becoming a 1950s housewife. This was crazy! I love taking care of my bf, but that doesn't mean I'm giving up on my career. It's just that I'm a morning person, so I handle morning chores, he does nighttime chores.Jen went on about how offended she was until I left the call. Later, mom, unbeknownst to me, texted bf and asked him to stop helping me out whenever I was zoom because it upsets Jen. He didn't take her seriously, at which point she said he - an outsider - was disrupting internal family matters (This is the man who has made it abundantly clear that the minute our financials are in order, he's asking me to marry him). He lost it and said he'll take care of whoever he pleases in his own house.So, this is where it might have gone into a-hole territory. As my mom persisted, bf said he had to look out for me since no one in my family would. This is not very far from the truth. Mom thinks older children always get the short end of the stick and has over-compensated by going the other way (e.g. I wasn't allowed to cry as a kid because ""younger children get it easier, so my problems were nothing in comparison to Jen's"", I had to share my birthdays & milestone events with her so that she didn't feel bad). This used to hurt, but I've made my peace with it.Now my extended family is blowing up my phone, saying we were rude and hurt mom's feelings. I got a text from my mom saying she did her best to be a good parent, but she was only human. This made me feel terrible tbh. But then she added that she expected bf to apologize to her and Jen on zoom in front of the entire extended family. I lost it! I'm not going to make him apologize for taking care of me just because they feel offended by it.So AITA for not making my BF apologize to my mom & sis?"
80,Not the A-hole,AITA For 'faking' a fainting spell?,4609,m0f4lj,374,"Just a note, I didn't actually fake it but I did dramatize it. I (17F) suffer from several medical conditions, one of which is fainting. We're still trying to figure out why this happens, but it does. I have a service dog, who is honestly the light of my life. He has saved me in so many ways and I'm forever grateful. I live with my dad but recently he's been hospitalised and it's not safe for me to be alone, so I'm staying with my mom, her husband and their kids. They refuse to acknowledge that my dog works. They constantly try to overfeed him, or give him food he is not allowed, and are always trying to distract him. No matter how much I tell them to leave it, they won't. He's almost missed several cues, and I am getting increasingly worried. If I were to have a seizure and he not alert me beforehand I could very easily fall and hit my head too hard.So, the other day, they were once again fussing over him, after I had told them several times to leave him alone. I went to walk over and remove him from them when my vision went blurry. This is a sign of a fainting spell, and when I can tell I'm about to have them I usually sit back down. I decided against it, and as one would imagine, fainted. I hit the ground pretty hard and had a headache, but most of the impact was on my arms. Even through this whole thing, my stepdad held my dog back while my mom tried to figure out what was wrong. I snapped and told him to give my dog back once I came around, and have since decided I'll take my chances living alone for a while. My dad found out I was planning on going back home, and called to ask why. I explained what had happened, and he asked why I had allowed myself to faint on the floor (he knows I can usually feel them coming) and I explained that I wanted to see if they would actually let my dog do his job. I'd rather faint in a more controlled way than have a seizure and not know if they're going to help me. I guess my brother heard and basically told his parents, both of which blew up at me for scaring them. Yelling triggered my PTSD and they once again refused to let my dog near to help. I have since left, and everyone is blowing up my phone, calling me an evil bitch for scaring them like that. My dad said I shouldn't of done it, and says I need to make up with them so I can go back, because he doesn't want me staying alone. I reiterated that even if I stay with them I'm at the same amount of risk because they won't help. At least here I have access to my dog. Am I the asshole?"
81,Not the A-hole,AITA for saying something I didn't need to?,7,m1ioo6,15,"Throwaway because my main account does have pretty obvious ties to me.For background, I (18) live with my grandma (80). My grandma can't drive. She never got her license, so my parents (mostly my mom) have mostly driven her to stores, appointments, and the casino. Since the pandemic, I have primarily taken on the responsibility of taking her grocery shopping every two weeks (for about two and a half hours) and to appointments about once every couple of months (anywhere from one to two hours, but typically only one). This is also my first year in college which I have been taking some time to adapt to.Usually, I don't mind taking her. She also pays me after I drive her which, while I appreciate, I would much rather her pay me maybe once a month instead, if anything, because I feel that it is my responsibility to take her and I don't need to be paid to be doing this.This is the week before my finals. I have my first one on Saturday in a very difficult subject for me and as such, I am trying to get as much time as I can in studying. I could have done a lot more studying last week, but I was fatigued because I had just finished taking my midterms (I am on a quarter system). So I fully take responsibility for that mistake, but I can't do anything about it now and just need to study as much as I can now.She asked me to take her to do a urine sample today. So I took her at about 9 AM and it was quick. Then she got a call that she has to go back in because she didn't give enough urine. The reason she didn't give enough urine was because she went to the bathroom right before we left to get to the office (about a 10 minute drive from our house). My dad said he could take her again at 2 PM because I am in class from 12:30-3:00 today. It turns out she declined my dad's offer. When I asked her why she said that she already told the office she couldn't make it today and would come tomorrow. I was upset because I knew that would mean I have to take her again tomorrow, despite her having the opportunity to go back today. The office isn't by appointment either, it's all just by drop in so I don't really know how much it would have mattered that she told them she couldn't come back?This is where I think I might be an asshole. I told her that I need to study. She said, ""It's only an hour."" I told her I know but I really need to study because my first test is on Saturday. I know she's mad at me because a little bit after that I asked her if it was fine to go tomorrow after my only class instead of the morning because I want to try and get some work done before. She didn't say anything and just shrugged. Later, she told me I had a package in a aggravated tone.I just feel like an asshole because I probably should have just kept my mouth shut, and because she pays me, but I was just so annoyed because I felt like my time was not being respected."
82,Not the A-hole,AITA for wanting compensation?,10,m1gt7y,30,"Quick back story, my (34m) wife (30f) and I have been married for 5 years. Together for 7. And in the past 2 and a bit years I have been working a fly in fly out job making good coin in the mines. So I'd be away from home for 2 to 6 weeks and home for 1 to 2 weeks before back to work. In the time I was away my then wife had to build a sort of normal life to deal with the time I wasn't around and as such I felt like an outsider when I got home. Jump to last august and she said she wasn't happy and wanted to ""act like we were separated"". I did up a spreadsheet of our assets with a ""short term"" ""long term"" and ""permanent"" separation options and found a new place to live. I moved out the next day and we sat down and went through the spreadsheet to which she agreed we were in long term and as such I left most of what we had with her in the house. Took a small amount of spare furniture, beds, etc. And bought new fridge, washing machine, and the rest to replace everything else I needed. This was fine to me as I wanted to make it work. Our five year anniversary came up a month later and I did up a wedding slideshow that id been working on since February trying to get pics and videos of friends and family (we didn't have a videographer). She said we could maybe get a meal and talk. But then nothing. Didn't answer her phone. Didn't reply to me until the next day saying she was busy with friends. Long story short over a few months I tried to talk with her about it. Work out what actually happened (there was no cheating or violence or aggression from either of us). And all to no avail. She would talk when she was ready. I ended up going to a mediator to discuss what was going on and split things more fairly for a permanent split. She brought her mum as her silent support person (who wouldn't shut up). And they had decided that I got the TV and cheap second hand car. And that she should keep everything else (including my dog). At this point ill add that I just finished helping her pay off all her debt (and was left with 20k debt of my own) and just finished building a verandah for the house (owned by her mum) to the tune of 15 grand. The house itself included thousands of dollars of equipment and furniture and basic appliances id already bought replacements of and in a private conversation she agreed that she would pay me half the verandah and half the bond I'd paid for the house and we both be on our merry. 6 months on and I havent seen anything. She keeps side stepping and my friends are in 2 minds. Just forget that I'll ever get the money and move on. Or fight and take what I deserve. Including my doggo. I messaged her again asking when I can see this money and she's pushed me back to July 2021. I'm starting to get ancy but don't know if I'm in the right here. So. Am I the asshole for wanting compensation from her?"

School was online, we basically lived together, spent every day 24/5-6 together. And we got along really well!!I graduated college May 2020 and moved an hour and a half away from him. Since then, the small signs of jealousy & trust issues got even bigger!! At least once a month we’re having a fight about something having to do with jealousy or distrust, neither of which I did anything to deserve. I’ve never cheated, never lied, never deleted a message. It’s his trauma & I understand that, so I try to be really patient.I’ve been really stressed with money, just paid off $4500 in debt these last three months. I’m working a ton, trying to workout, I am the ONLY person in my house who cleans regularly, and I honestly just feel like I have no time for myself.My boyfriend and I used to see each other every weekend, but I asked to move it to every other weekend. It took almost a month before we finally followed through on it.Now, this last weekend, we took a trip to another city & got a hotel to celebrate our anniversary. I planned it this way specifically because our anniversary falls in the middle of the week & is harder to plan around.Last night comes around & he’s asking what time we’re having dinner for our anniversary tonight. I said “I thought we had planned not to do anything, since we just took the whole weekend!”. Mind you, we did brunches, dinners, bubble baths, wine, the whole nine yards.He is insistent, which I get. It’s our anniversary & it’s special. He’s coming to my town to have dinner & I think it’s sweet he took on the drive just for that.He’s on his way right now, but I asked him if he could head out after dinner, and he flipped out. I have to shower tonight, I just got my car wrecked into over our anniversary weekend, I have so much to do that I can’t seem to find the time for each day this week & he is mad at me! I told him I wanted the extra time to pamper myself & decompress, and he hits me with the, “oh, well I thought hanging out with me made you feel relaxed. I didn’t realize it stressed you out.”Y’ALL? Am I not seeing something? Am I the asshole, after planning our entire anniversary weekend, for wanting extra time to take a bath instead of a shower & feel rested after dealing with insurance & work & housekeeping every second since I stepped through my front door on Sunday afternoon?TLDR it’s my anniversary & my boyfriend is coming up for dinner. We just spent a weekend away for our anniversary, and I’ve been really stressed, so I asked if he could head home right after dinner because I want some time for myself tonight & he freaked out. AITA for not wanting to spend more time together on our anniversary, even though we just took a weekend to celebrate it? Help me."
84,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not wanting to clean the bathroom I share with my nieces every week and calling them spoiled, then moving out?",510,m0ta3i,132,"Every Friday I (f20) clean with my family. This has been our thing for ages. Clean up day is Friday and everyone does their part, you make the mess you clean it. Since 12 I had cleaned my own bathroom, vacuumed the entire house or the top floor and did dishes. I remember one time when I was 13 my mom made me do the dishes until I finished and I didn’t stop until 2AM. In high school When I lived at my sister’s house I cleaned the bathroom once a week. Even in boarding school when I went to slept at my sister’s for the weekend, I would still have to clean the bathroom.Now due to covid I had to live with my family in their new house last semester. I slept in the office since the house doesn’t have an extra room. I also ate my own food usually and had to pay them $250 a month to sleep in the office. I really didn’t care until somehow my payment included me cleaning the bathroom again regularly.I don’t mind cleaning the bathroom at all but her kids are about 10/12 now and have zero responsibility. Meanwhile when I was that age my sister and mom had me cleaning all the time. So now she wanted me to clean the bathroom I shared with her kids every week and I would not have cared if her kids were not spoiled, disrespectful and messy. Every Friday I had to ask her kids to pick up their piles of clothes from the bathroom to which they would argue with me and my sister would say “just shut the fuck up I’m tired of you arguing with kids about cleaning! Just shut your mouth and clean it” So I did. For weeks I cleaned the damn bathroom with shit stains and clothes everywhere. Her kids had zero consideration and would also do “science” experiments in the bathroom and squeeze toothpaste all over the mirrors and what not. I could not even put my own things in the bathroom because her kids would brake it. I constantly was cleaning up after every mess they would make in the bathroom and their parents would not care to discipline them. They still don’t even flush because they know that I or someone else will do it. I would refuse to flush after them and tell them to but then they would argue with me and my sister would just say flush it because they won’t listen. Their dad basically does all their chores for them bc they don’t want to deal with their tantrums. I pointed out how spoiled they were to my sister and how I wouldn’t mind cleaning the bathroom if they did the basics of cleaning up after themselves but she says I’m being lazy and unwilling to do my part in the house. Her and my mom would defend them bc they are kids and I’m the adult. So I moved out. Now my sister is still salty over me leaving and I don’t even like visiting her house on the weekends because somehow they find a way for me to clean it. I’m not expecting her kids to be maids or anything but they lack any form of respect aside from doing basic chores. AITA for not wanting to and calling her kids spoiled for not having to do the things I did at their age?Edit: I do not think my sister is a terrible mother and her kids aren’t being neglected or abused. They both refuse to listen whatsoever when their parents try everything but give in once a tantrum ensues. They know I don’t give in to the tantrums and that also annoyed their parents bc we can hear them screaming and yelling all day bc they didn’t get their way.Edit 2: I see what you all mean now, I just never thought like that before. I was adopted by my family at 12 and came from nothing. My family taught me about give and take, “we put a roof over your head” so I should clean. She isn’t doing her job as the parent I agree, thanks for the eye-opener...."
85,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I sold the house my parents live in?,405,m0uohb,99,"Background: my sister (29) and I (30) bought the house my parents (45F and 42M) now live in about 8 years ago, taking a loan out while I was still in University. Our parents' credit was terrible and they were being evicted from the house they were renting (using my sister's income to pay the rent). As a family, we agreed that buying the house for them would allow them to rebuild their credit. My parents paid the mortgage as their ""rent"" and have the run of the property as if it's their own -- we never wanted to profit off them. My sister and I have now bought our own houses with our fiancés, each taking on second loans.The house burned down in September and my parents lost everything. Luckily, the insurance I selected (and paid for up to a few months before the fire when they took over the payments) will cover everything. My parents have already gotten a new (to them) truck and an RV (which they're living in until the new house is built) and there is still money leftover. None of which is going to my sister or myself.During all of this, the relationship between us and our parents has become incredibly strained. They have made comments that we aren't doing enough, that the insurance isn't enough, etc. and my sister and I want out of the situation completly. When we've brought this up, suggesting they take over the remainder of the loan, our parents won't hear any of it, and have even said that ""nobody is going to sell their house out from under them.""WIBTA for selling the house ""out from under them"" if they continue to avoid taking over the loan? They're my parents and they have relied on my sister and my income since we started working at 16 y/o but they are making more now than we were when we bought the house. My sister and I are trying to plan our lives entering our 30s but our parents obviously need us..."
86,Not the A-hole,AITA for beating my girlfriend in board games?,82,m131cn,73,"My girlfriend and I love playing board games togehter and most of the time we play against eachother. When we play games that heavily involve stratergy I win about 95% of the time. Now I don't have a problem with losing but I am competitive and usually try my best to win, as it helps me explore and appreciate these games. There have been a few times where when we my a few games or rounds in a session my partner gets upset after I have won multiple times in a row or if she hasn't won at all. Sometimes I do intentionally not play optimally which she sometimes (not always) picks up on and gets mad at me for letting her win.I feel like i struggle to find a balance of playing a game where I get to play hard, so that I enjoy it and not making her upset and even more so if she catches me taking it easy on her. So i want to know if im the asshole for beating her most of the time, or if someone can provide me a different persective to help me with this issue."
87,Not the A-hole,AITA for moving away from my mother?,11,m1eyrw,13,"So jumping right into it, my mother and I have a rocky relationship. My dad was horrid to her and that treatment trickled down to me. Eventually they divorced and my mom moved away with my younger siblings. I soon followed after, and everything seemed to be looking up.Fast forward about two years, I had met my husband and we're going to have my mom's first grandchild. My mother has always wanted grandkids and doesn't let me or my younger sister forget it. She's always lamenting how her own younger siblings are already grandparents and she's not yet. Makes one feel like their sole purpose is to produce grandchildren. My little one arrives, and my mom is a wonderful grandmother, but our relationship begins to erode back to square one again. Her guilt tripping and overstepping bounds leads to a huge falling out between her and my husband, leaving me between a rock and a hard place. So my solution to all the problems is to move closer to my husband's family (so we can have a support system), which happens to be two states away. My relationship with my mother always seems to improve the further I am away from her.When I told my mother I was moving, she's immediately angry, saying I'm taking her only grandchild away from her. Children aren't supposed to move away from their families, especially their mothers. She's jealous over the fact that my husband's mother will have more to do with my daughter than she will, saying ""She already has a grandkid, I don't have any, it's not fair."" Her yelling only pushes me further into the plan.We moved away about a year and a half ago, and today I'm still getting guilt tripped over how she doesn't have a relationship with her grandchild, she has a relationship with a phone. I tried telling her that there are many grandparents who deal with having grandchildren far from them and she came back with ""The number is fewer than you think."" She then started talking about her recent trip to visit her own grandmother and said how it reminds her that she'll never have that with her grandkid. I told her the guilt tripping wasn't going to work and she hung up without even saying goodbye. Now I'm starting to wonder if it was the right call to move away because I know she misses my daughter and this is something she always wanted. I feel horrible about it after speaking with her, feeling like I stole something from her and that I'm the asshole she says I am. I think perhaps she was just trying to vent her frustrations and that I'm being selfish for staying away, even though travel is sketchy due to the pandemic.AITA?"
88,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my mum I feel like she doesn’t support me enough?,31,m1756b,13,"TW: mention of eating disorder Yesterday, me (16F) and my mum (48F) got into an argument and I’m not sure who was being the AH in the situation. Context: I am suffering from an eating disorder and have already had it for about a year. Three months ago, I officially told my parents about it and asked them to allow me to go to therapy. At first it was all fine, my mum immediately made an appointment with my doctor and I am now regularly going to therapy. My parents told me they would always be there for me and if I felt depressed or felt guilty about recovering I could always come to them and they would try to console me. That is really nice of them and I 100% appreciate it. However, when I came to them while crying a few times, I got the feeling that I was just annoying them and they made me feel like I was exaggerating.Therefore, I haven’t really come to them when I was feeling down since because I also don’t want to be a burden.Unfortunately, my mother doesn’t really understand my issue. I kindly asked her multiple times to adjust certain meals a tiny bit for me because it would really help me. However, she never does, as she doesn’t see the point in it. We had arguments about that already and I told her that I would cook these meals for myself, but she refused because she doesn’t want me to weigh my food etc. Yesterday, my mum came into my room and asked me how I was doing. I answered truthfully that I wasn’t doing so well that particular evening and also explained why. I almost started crying because I was just really exhausted. She then told me to “just get over it” because it “can’t be all that bad”. I then really started crying because I was really frustrated. I got a bit angry, so I told her “I’m sorry, but I can’t just get over it because to me this is very hard and I’m trying my best. I feel like you don’t support me enough in my recovery!” She then just gasped and left my room. I felt really bad and we haven’t really talked since because she’s angry at me. I can’t really decide if I’m at fault for telling her that she doesn’t support me enough even though she enabled me to go to therapy and says she’s always there for me. I know that this is hard on her as well and I’m guessing she blames herself to some extent and that’s why she wants this whole ordeal to be over as fast as possible. On the other hand, I don’t think it is okay for her to be telling me to “just get over it” because it is just not that simple and I felt she really discredited me and the achievements I already made by saying that. So, AITA?"
89,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting to get caught up in the battle between the rest of my housemates and the neighbours over trimming a hedge?,6,m1jlw3,20,"So me and my three flat mates have been living here for about 3 years. About 2 years ago, they started a band which created some tension between them and the neighbours due to the noise. They complained about the music, and in response the bad organised to make the whole thing much quieter and that is no longer an issue.However the other flatmates have taken their issue extremely personally, and now take issue with absolutely everything to do with the neighbours. This includes the fact that the neighbours come over every two weeks to trim the other side of the hedge between our two properties. They have done this the entire time that we lived here, and before we moved here. A few months ago, one flatmate went and asked them to stop and then asked me to tell our property manager what was happening. At this point, I didn’t message them as I didn’t think it would be a lasting issue- the neighbours do this when everyone is at work, and it just happened that someone else was home.Now a few days ago, flatmate was home and the same thing happened. The neighbour and the flatmate talked, where the neighbour said they’ve always done this with permission of the homeowner. Again, flatmate asked me to ask the property manager to get them to stop. I didn’t send any messages, and told him I wanted to stay out of it because I didn’t see the issue- if anything they’re saving us money.Now, the neighbours have gone to the property manager and told them what’s happened and the property manager is asking us to allow the neighbours onto the property. I showed the message to the group flat chat, and one person just said ‘permission denied’, so I commented that I had no issue with what was happening and that I didn’t like the tension because it’s my name solely on the tenancy, and thus I have to now deal with it.Flatmate wasn’t happy that I wasn’t siding with them, asking why I even bothered to show the message if it wasn’t a democracy and that I was just ‘flexing my authority’. I decided to turn off notifications at that point, but now I’m sitting here feeling like an asshole for causing tension in the flat, to go along with the tension between neighbours. AITA?"
90,Not the A-hole,AITA (25M) for encouraging my competitive step-brother (25M) into a career he didn't really want?,4413,m0dwxs,301,"This came up recently and I was told I was an asshole, but want to hear from other people.My mom married his dad when we were both 8. We all got along well, his dad was an ok guy and my mom was happy.He was hypercompetitive about everything where I was a lot more laid back and chill. We actually balanced each other out a lot I think.Great, eh? Until we went to HS and he started competing directly with me, for things I liked and cared about. He took friends from me. Any girl I expressed an interest in, he went after, dating them for a short while then breaking up. I learned not to tell him who I liked.I loved TKD so then he had to do it - he was much more athletic than me and put in a lot more work so he advanced quicker (his schoolwork suffered badly for it and I had to help him). I was glad he found something he liked but he edged me out of it. He did the same with guitar. I talked to him about it and he either dismissed it or said it didn't matter. We got on so well in other areas so it was always weird, but he didn't apologize or stop doing it. Parents didn't listen when I talked to them about it.My friend Alice was the only person he couldn't become friends with. She's an amazing artist. One day he came into my room and saw some of her drawings, and asked if I drew them. I said I did. ""Yeah I draw at Alice's house... I don't want the attention from mom and David (stepdad)."" I don't know why. I just wanted something of my own for once that he couldn't have.But of course he could - he then learned to draw, and got good at it over the next few years.I lied about my college/uni course, said I was doing graphics and computer game design. I took up weightlifting and started doing a different martial art (BJJ) and never told him. He got jobs in graphic design.At no point did it seem like something he didn't enjoy, but I did egg him on, saying stuff like ""you draw so well, way better than I ever did"".So now we're both 25 years old. I've been incredibly lucky in a career I love. It took a lot of hard work which people were surprised with - I never saw myself as 'lazy' but even people said I had a very chilled-out personality. Recently it was David's birthday so I got him the manly meme gift of expensive whiskey and cigars, and wore a suit when I came over (he's former military and likes that kind of thing). We had a great evening. He opened up and we had an actual talk, he said he was proud of me. I had to hold back tears at one point.Stepbro came over late (deadline) and bought a bottle of wine. As the evening went on I was doing a bit of BJJ with David (we're in the same household bubble and work online). I could see stepbro getting more and more upset, making snide remarks here and there. He looked hurt, his dad was getting angry with him.I told Alice all of this at our weekly zoom. She said she didn't know it was that deep - I shouldn't have involved her in ""a massive lie"" and I took opportunities away from Stepbro.AITA?*Edit:* You're all so awesome for replying to me - I feel a lot better about the situation and you've all given me a lot to think about. I want to keep growing my relationship with my Stepfather, and I will see if Stepbro wants help in changing career direction but I'll stop feeling guilty that he's not always happy with graphic design.Thank you all so muchEdit 2:* I came back this morning to 100 new replies! I'm really busy with work so I can't reply to all of them, but I will read them all. Thank you for replying and giving me so much to think about, you've all helped in far more ways than just saying I'm not so much of an asshole :) love and best wished to you all"

92,Not the A-hole,AITA for wanting my(f18) sisters(20) boyfriend(21) out of the house,13,m1bw7n,33,"PLEASE take a minute to read, just looking for some Parental advice.Few key points to take into consideration:\-My sister has suffered with an eating disorder and severe depression before (hence my mothers over protectiveness)\-Parents are separated, me and my younger sister(16) alternate between houses and my older sister lives permanently with my mum\-My relationship with my older sister is very strained and definitely not what it used to be since she has been with her boyfriend of just over a year\-You may find this extremely petty but all I am after is some adult/parental adviceIn the past month or so my sisters boyfriend... we will call him Steve, has become a lot more comfortable living with us. Here ar a few things he has one in this past year that has really tipped me over the edge loud obnoxious sex in a full house, playing his Xbox in a communal living room for a prolonged amount of time, eating the food my mum buys even though he has been asked to buy his own food, disrespectful to my mum when asked to wash his dishes, and the worst part is my mother washes his clothes!!! I tell you it all kicked off on Sunday when my two sisters had and falling out and I decided to check on my younger sister. After doing this I left the room to find my older sister had been listening in on the conversation. So when I asked what she was doing she returned to her bedroom and ignored. So I persisted, standing outside her door asking her the same question until she came out and said “I don‘t want to be involved in your drama” I said “this is not an argument I am a part of, you are”.We left it at that and as I walk down the stairs I hear Steve in the kitchen with my mum and stepdad saying that I... needed to just drop it. I was shocked to say the least. I couldn’t believe he was getting involved in something that was none of his business and to say that to my own mother. I went in all guns blazing “you’ve got some nerve you have saying that, the past month you have lost all respect for everyone in this house and I’ve had enough“ I then told him to bugger off whilst he laughed in my face and then proceeded to loiter in the kitchen with confidence for the next ten minutes I’d say.This is not the first time he has done wrong, a few weeks ago my sister was having a down week and didn’t talk to anyone at all apart from Steve of course. So my mum eventually asked Steve what was wrong with her and he replied with “I dont think its anyones business“. Shocked, my younger sister who was also in the room said “I think it is her business as she is her mum” Steve said nothing, rolled his eyes and left the room.I have BEGGED my mum on two occasions to send him back to his family home but she won’t because that isn’t fair on my sister. Please tell me Am I Being The Ass here because mum seems to think I am."

94,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting mad that my sister is being mushy with her Bf?,14,m1boto,21,"Recently me and my family went on a vacation for the weekend. This trip included me, my mother, my sister and her boyfriend. We decided that we would just get one hotel room (two beds) to save on some cash. My sister's  boyfriend has come on family trips before and he's actually a very cool dude. The biggest problem is that both he and my sister are very affectionate which wouldn't be a problem if me and my mom weren't in the same room with them. They've been dating for a year but are still acting like they are in their puppy love stage. They were constantly kissing and making inuendos and jokes of what they would do when me and my mom went to sleep (our bed is literally a foot away from theirs). Constantly whispering in each other's ears, hopping on top of eachother and even showering together. The boy is wrapped around my sister's finger. He even at one point in the trip let her clean her brand new shoes with his underwear (which I thought was weird because there are no shortage of towels in a hotel room) Neither me or my mom care that they are having sex, but we both agreed that it was sort of disrespectful to do stuff like that knowing we were near by. We called them out on it multiple times. And my sister got really mad, saying that we were jealous and what not. I'm really happy that my sister has found such a great relationship. And I'm glad she feels comfortable enough to share this with us but sometimes it's a lot. Idk AITA for wanting them to calm down a bit infront of me?"
95,Not the A-hole,AITA for not lowering my prices for a friend?,2078,m0giyv,426,"I (28 F) work in a school. As a side-hustle, I bake cakes and cookies. I've had some people from my school order from me after I made some baked goods for the school Christmas cookie swap. I just started in this school, and one of the people who helped me when I first got here was a woman who we'll call Fran. Fran loved the cookies that I made for the swap, and has since mentioned ordering some from me. I said sure, just to let me know what she wanted and when. It's her birthday next month, and she asked me to make her a cake. She described what she wants, so I suggested my recipe that most closely fits what she wants. It's a little extra, but it was close to what she wanted. It requires a lot of time and some pretty pricey ingredients. I told her that I could do it for about $35. She said it was too expensive and asked what the lowest price I would accept would be. I said $35 is the lowest I can go, since because the recipe requires a lot of expensive ingredients, I would only be accounting for covering the ingredients, not really even my time (which, for this specific cake would be around 3.5-4 hours total). I did say that I understood it being too expensive, and offered to make her a simpler cake for about $10 less. She said she also couldn't afford the simpler cake. This morning, she came into my classroom and asked me what I charge for cookies. I told her that, unfortunately, because the cookies take so much time (I use a royal icing and I have to let them dry for about 24-hours after they're decorated), I have a dozen cookie minimum, and they're more expensive than the simple cake she said she couldn't afford. She got really huffy with me and basically said that since I'm her friend, and since I know that she's having another baby, I should help her because she can't afford my prices. I told her I'm sorry, but if she really wants a cake for her birthday, the ones at the local grocery store are pretty good and might be more within her price range. She hasn't talked to me since, and I'm beginning to feel like I should have just agreed to make her the cake and just given it to her as a birthday present because now I feel awkward around her. AITA?UPDATE: She has now asked me for the cheaper cake but asked what decorations I can do to make it look fancier. At this point, I don’t want to make her anything, because I know she’ll keep asking for things and not want to pay. I have no idea what to say other than to tell her to bugger off."
96,Not the A-hole,AITA For Saying To My Aunt What She Said To Me,2320,m0f4e7,201,"Hello, obligatory ‘on mobile’ apologies for typos or formatting.To get to the issue, my aunt comes over rather regularly (at least twice a week). I would call this a bit of an issue with ‘everything’ going on, but the main issue, is in my opinion, my aunt is entirely entitled. By this aunt I have 2 cousins, both boys who are 9 and 13 years old. The boys are extremely sweet, but of course like normal kids have their moments. My aunt is recently separated from her husband. Which may explain why my mom lets her come over so often, but I’ve never really liked her. Well most of the time when they come over I just play video games with the boys. I realized early on listening to her and my mother arguing with each other that there was really no need to put my point of view in. That was the norm until her and her husband separated. I’m a 23 yr old woman, and my aunt still treats me like a child.I recently (it’s been about 7 months) started dating a new person. It’s been years since I’ve dated anyone (and he’s amazing), but my aunt didn’t like him from the start. Any and everything she’s said about him has been negative. The rest of my family love him, including my cousins, but she has made it evident her disdain for him. Finally, the other day when my aunt and cousins came over, my bf and I were leaving to go to work. She loudly commented that he and I “would never work together, men are trash, and women who stand by trash men are whores”. I turned around and flipped on her. I told her that her and her husband were separated, and if she’s always calling her man “trash” then she’s only speaking about herself being a “whore”. I know, I was out of line saying this. My cousins were luckily not around when this happened, but she’s said they’re never allowed to see me again. My family is split now because I talked back to her. My parents are on my side, but my mom still says it’s my fault that this is happening because I could’ve kept my mouth shut. My aunt thinks I’m completely in the wrong and I should apologize to her. I do feel bad, but not for how she feels, more just my cousins. I understand I’m an adult, and should have better self control, but am I an asshole for talking back?Edit- I feel a need to add based off a comment received, the other reason I felt like an asshole was my boyfriend did not know the extent of her disdain for him. I tried to keep that hidden from him to not hurt him, but while the rest of my family tried to reassure him, I still felt bad that I could’ve given him a better warning."
97,Not the A-hole,AITA for not driving Mom to Physical Therapy for her Wrist?,12,m1a1ps,74,"Background – Mother (M) is 55, lives alone & 35-45 minutes away from me & my Brother (B) depending on traffic. I am married & my husband & I have a toddler, & B is a full time college student. We live in the same apt complex so drive time to M's is the same. There is quite a bit of baggage in the relationship between each of us and M, to the point my B is seriously considering going no contact. Also necessary to this, our Grandparents (Gs) live 5+ hours away.M broke her right wrist 2/8/2021, had surgery to fix the break with a plate & a handful of screws on 2/24/2021, had post-op appointment 3/8/2021 & was cleared to begin physical therapy 3X per week.In all of that time, at her request, she has not been alone for more than 2 hrs between one of us leaving & another arriving. She doesn’t drive, walk around, get her own pain & nausea medications, or fix herself meals she just sits with her arm propped up in her recliner. Whenever one of us is there, we are quite literally her legs because she says she can't walk without getting dizzy. This extends to running her bath for her, bringing her various items (including the tv remote), doing several household chores, etc.Gs have been staying at her house & making weekly trips home to check on their own home. They have been helping as much as they are able, but most of her care still falls to B & me which has caused me to miss several days at work & has caused B to miss a few tests.Now that she's been cleared to begin physical therapy, the doctor has also told her that the only thing keeping her from driving is her continued use of pain killers.Our Gs are going home this Friday, & M has already decided that B & I are going to be responsible for getting her to her physical therapy appointments because even if she gets off the pain killers she can't reach the gear shift in her car.I have missed enough work that I literally can't be her taxi. Not to mention for either B or me taking her to her appointments means driving 35-45 minutes there, twiddling our thumbs for an hour, getting her set at home, & then driving 35-45 minutes home. In her eyes, B is ""just"" a college student, so he should be able to handle it since I can't. However, he still has classes, he still has job interviews, he still has plans with his (serious) girlfriend, & it isn't fair to expect him to be at her beck & call.I tried explaining that we would do what we could but that neither of us would be able to take her to all of her appointments, & I explained Uber/Lift or an actual taxi might be an option & I offered to help her figure out how to drive herself.She burst into tears, saying she can't drive because she's still on the pain medication, how could we expect her to get to her appointments on her own, how she needs help & can't do this on her own, how she still needs our help around her house just on & on making me feel like I was being completely unreasonable in expecting her to help herself.AITA here?EDIT\*\*\* my husband works nights, so he sleeps during the day for anyone wondering why he can't drive her."
98,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for telling my MIL to stop coming over unanncouned?,1540,m0gz5d,261,"Me (25F) and my boyfriend (30M) live together in a house that he bought last year. I'm working on getting my PhD so I did not have the money to apply for a mortgage. However, I pay for the groceries and payed for furniture. We made it clear that it would be OUR house and not just his.My relationship with my MIL is good, but recently she picked up the habit to come over unannounced.*For example:*I was napping on the couch and suddenly she entered the living room, asking me why I was asleep at 3PM and that I could have already started to make dinner for my boyfriend. I told her that I had worked the night before but she didn't think that was a valid reason to be taking a nap.A few days ago she came in and threw my plants away that I had bought while my BF and I were both at work. When I asked her why, she told me she thought they were dead (they were not). Every time I am home alone I fear that she will randomly show up and tell me that I should take care of her son or that I'm not doing enough.I've talked to my BF about this and he thinks she is just 'looking out for him' and  she has good intentions. I feel like I'm being put away as a 'bad woman' for not cleaning the whole day and making sure my BF has a warm meal when he comes home from work and trying to rescue plants. It feels like she is checking on me or that she is gathering evidence to show her son that I will not make a good future wife.WIBTA for telling her to stop coming over unannounced?"
99,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting my best friend to work with me?,8,m1e9qm,42,"Hi so just for background, I’m 18 F and my friend is a non binary so to represent them I’m going to go with the letter E.So last summer my friend E told me about a job at a pet store, we both applied cause we wanted to work together, but I was the only one who they wanted. I’ve been working their ever since last may and it’s almost been a year and I honestly really like my job, I love my coworkers and it the people I come into contact with and I can say I think I have grown as a person from working here. So about three weeks ago my job stated how they were gonna try and hire a few new people and my friend E asked me to give my boss good recommendation of them, as they still wanted the job and was planning on applying again. I told them I would try but I never got around to it. In all honesty I avoid talking to my boss about it, as I knew the job I had wouldn’t be right for E. I’ve tried to explain to them about what I have to do and they don’t seem to fully listen, I’ve told them the many times I’ve had to clean dirty and gross bathroom and they just responded with “lol I’ll just get the other people to do it, I’m not touching the toilets lol” Yesterday my boss came to me and asked me about a person who wanted a job here, he stated how they said they knew me and how I would vouch for them. I took a long pause and told them the truth about my friend. I said they have the best intentions and are hard working but is too sensitive for the job, as we get many angry costumers and that E is terrible with confrontation. E is one of my best friends and I adore them dearly but they are VERY SENSITIVE, I once saw them cry in class over a prompt they didn’t want to write about. My job is easy but the customers are a make it or break it deal in my opinion, you have to have thick skin. Hell I’ve even been sexually harassed. I know 100% the one time a person misgenders E. They will cry and break down. After I told my boss the truth about how I feel about my E, she sent me on home. When I got home I got a very angry phone call from Es mom. She began screaming at me and calling me names, yelling at me about how could I spread stupid lies about E and that I cost E the job. I told her that I’m sorry but I had to tell the truth, E isn’t good in customer service, I’ve seen them yell and cry at others for telling a innocent joke. She hang up and E texted me not to call or talk to them ever again. This feeling a guilt keeps riding on my back, I’ve talk to my boyfriend about it, and as I was talking out my feelings, I also admitted how I also didn’t want E to get the job with me because I had made work friends, and how I didn’t like the idea of my work life and outside life mixing. I told him I feel selfish and a bitch for how I handle the situation. He told me I’m overreacting and that E can find a new job somewhere else. I just feel like shit, am I the asshole?Edit1) let me explain that I did explain my job to E thousands of times, but whenever I gave them an example of we few different jobs that I have to do, like cleaning the toilets or picking up dog poop they would laugh and say “I will just ask my coworker to do it, or if we work together I know you’ll do it for me” Edit 2) I accidentally left out some of the story, my manger told E that I didn’t approve of being a Voucher. E called me when I got home and asked me what happened and why I didn’t vouch for them, I told them the truth and they hung up on me"
100,Not the A-hole,AITA for not doing the dishes for two days in a row?,11,m1aant,25,"So, I live with my mother who works in retail and claims it's very tiring for her. I'm a university student and I'm doing everything I can so I'll graduate this semester, I'm also currently writing my major paper. Sometimes I teach on the weekends and I'm doing EVERYTHING regarding housework. Plus I'm the only one who takes care of our pets. My mom's only responsibilities are going to work, taking showers and doing her hair. She often says she's busy because she has to do these basic self care tasks and then spends the rest of her day on the sofa on her phone or sleeping. There's a huge pile of work for me to do every day, I need some time for myself to think. So I skipped doing the dishes for two days and my mom is acting like I let her down and that I'm being lazy and disrespectful. I don't think she plans on helping me out in the future either, I told her I really needed to take some hours of my day for myself and she just told me that I shouldn't have :) She expects everything to be ready by the time she gets home so I'm often doing chores around the house while being on the zoom call with headphones on so I don't miss class. This isn't too sufficient of course but she'll throw a fit if I haven't completed all of the work and I really don't want to deal with that. She also HAS TO be around me at all times when she's in the house she's almost always interrupting me when I'm doing uni work or if I'm in my room for whatever reason. She can't stand staying alone, while alone time is very important to me. I might be studying or listening to music or painting or whatever but she'll get me to sit on the sofa with her so we can do nothing together. Idk it's a very weird situation, she has no life of her own and no hobbies at all. I'll automatically stop doing whatever I'm doing when she arrives home. She pressures me to be successful with uni but won't really let me?"
101,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I don't invite my siblings to my wedding?,340,m0ryp5,104,"Going to cut what could turn into a ramble very short. I (23f) am the youngest of four. I have three older siblings (35f) (33f) (32m) who have a different dad to me. Their dad is my mom's first husband and he passed from cancer three years before she met my dad and five years before my parents were married. My siblings and I are not close. There is actually no real relationship there. They have always found it hard to accept that our mom got married again and even though they never spoke badly to me, they also made it pretty clear they wish I had never existed. Not through words or even actions but there was always a coldness there, a lack of anything. I felt like an only child honestly. It always felt like they were separate and they wanted to be. I think the first time the realization hit me for real was when I was 8 and I'd been in an accident and they never came to see me in the hospital for the two weeks I was in.  But then when I was 13 I was talking to my cousin and he admitted that my siblings had never really wanted me and always felt like I was just a reminder their dad was never coming back. He said they didn't hate me. But they were really really not into the whole idea of having their family change after their dad died.So it's been about a year and a half since I saw them, haven't spoken to them since either. I actually was never truly introduced to their kids or anything either. I know they exist. But again the relationship just isn't wanted.And I am finally in a place where I can accept that. And I don't want to be thinking about that on my wedding day. But when I see them it's all I think about. I think about how they just don't love me or want me and it doesn't feel good. I mentioned it to my parents and my mom was really upset and told me I needed to invite them because they had never treated me poorly. My dad told me he was secretly glad and it's not so easy for him too and I should follow my heart.My mom keeps telling me it would be the wrong move if I don't invite them. AITA?"
102,Not the A-hole,AITA for waking my fiance to help me with our kids?,6,m1g0j8,24,"Please don't post this anywhere.I (23F) and my fiance (24M), have 2 toddlers. They are very bouncy and active. When I woke up this morning I felt horrible, I felt the same yesturday, but today it felt worse. I felt like I was going to throw up and everything hurt. I told my fiance this when I woke him up in the morning. That I felt horrible and that's why my grandmother had the kids in the morning. So he gets up, brings the kids into the room, gets them food, and goes back to sleep. So I decide I can entertain them. I play with them as best I can, but periodicly wake my fiance to help because I feel like I'm going to activly throw up every time they bounce. I ask him to grab me some wipes and a diaper so I can change our youngest, and if he can get them some grapes. He doesn't respond. So I wake him and ask again. Nothing. I roll my eyes and just play with the kids for a while, then ask again. Nothing. At this point I feel like hell, and I'm very annoyed he won't even answer me. I eventually wake him up, and this whole thing happens.Me: What's up with you today?Him: I wasn't able to sleep last night, but I still have to get up. When you don't get any rest I let you sleep, but you have to wake me up. He then left the room with the kids. Any other day I would gladly watch the kids while he naps. No problem. But right now I want to throw up and rip my uterus out. I can't even get up, let alone handle the kids on my own right now. I needed help. I feel bad about waking him up, maybe I should've just delt with it. At the same time, I sit up and am filled with horrible nausea. AITA?Edit: Sorry if it was confusing, we're currently at my grandmother's since she is scared of being alone. So she was with our kids in the living room, my fiance just walked over and got them into the bedroom."
103,Not the A-hole,AITA For telling my brother I'm never loaning him money again?,142,m0wwy5,29,"So I (16M) recently got grade money. I've never been a good student, so my parents promised me 20$ for every A I received. I worked really hard and they ended up giving me 120 dollars! I was so happy and told my brother (14M) that I would take him shopping and that he could use my grade money, but he had to pay me back half of what he spent. We went shopping and he ended up buying 40 dollars worth of books, comics, etc. using my money. He assured me that he had 20 dollars. I forgot about him owing me money for a few days, so I was surprised when I learned that he had recently spent tons of money on Pokémon cards. I asked him whether he had spent the money he was supposed to pay me back with, and he said no. I then asked him to pay me back, and he quickly backtracked and said that he did spend the money. I asked him if he had a plan to earn more money, and he said no. I yelled at him and told him that I'm never loaning him money again. My parents say that I'm being to harsh and he just made a mistake. Reddit, AITA?"
104,Not the A-hole,AITA for not taking care of my roommates cat?,28,m14jws,23,"Hello, this is my first post on here so bear with me. I moved in with my friend in August. We talked about pets before moving in together. She wanted to get a dog and I wanted to get cats. In December we talked to our landlord but he won't allow a dog, which was a huge bummer for my roommate. In January I thought about adopting a cat and talked to my roommate about it but she said she didn't want two cats, only one. I said I wouldn't wanna get a cat that doesn't have a friend to play with and I don't want a cat that needs to be kept alone because it doesn't get along with others because I might wanna get another cat in the future. So I said that it's fine and I'll wait to get my cats until we no longer live together (in presumably 3-4 years). She didn't like that idea either because she wanted pets in the house and kept trying to convince me to get just one cat but when I didn't give in she had a new idea. Since it's ""unfair"" how I'd have two cats and she wouldn't have a pet she decided we should get one cat each. We agreed on that and that we'd each take our cats with us when we move out. A few weeks later she got a Persian cat off of Craigslist. He's very sweet and I love him very much but this is where the problem started. I do things like feed him when she forgets to or play with him but she has to clean his litter box and take care of his fur since he's her cat but she's starting to make me feel like the asshole. For example, he got poop stuck in his long fur and she told me I had to clean it because ""You saw it first"" when I told her it's her responsibility since it's her cat she got mad and told me to just do it. She also kicks him out of her bedroom at night when he's being annoying and he'll scream the whole night because he wants to get in. She now keeps hinting at the fact that she'll leave him to me when we move apart. She has told me on at least three occasions how we ""probably can't seperate the cats because they've grown too close"" and how I'd never give her my cat (which is true) so I HAVE to take her cat with me. But I don't want to. I feel like an ass for saying it but I don't want her cat. He's a Persian so caring for his fur is a lot of work which I never signed up for. I got a short haired cat for a reason. Also he's very clingy which is cute sometimes but I just prefer cats that are a little more independent, which is why I got a cat that's more independent. I feel bad for saying I don't want him but i think before adopting a pet you should consider what you want in a pet and decide on one that fits your life and I never signed up for the responsibility of a long haired and very needy cat.AITA?"
105,Not the A-hole,AITA if I don't go out of my way to give someone their jury summons?,540,m0n4ga,79,"We have been renting the same house for 4 years and have always gotten the old tenants mail, they know this and used to contact us every few weeks to get it, which i get and it wasnt a big deal. But it's been four years (and no they dont own the house). Theyre even still registered to vote with our current address but by the end of the first year seemed to change their address for other things like krogers coupons and amazon. Well about a month ago one of them (its like 5 people) got a jury summons, i was like wtf but called the courthouse twice and sent it back with the ""Returned to sender, moved"" they told me to put. The first time i called someone straight up told me its their problem/fault and to just throw it out. the second person acted like i knew the people personally and kept demanding her forwarding address, which i dont know and was never given nor was the landlord but ultimately told me to put it back in the post. so i did. today, got a second notice, again i called the courthouse told them the situation and they told me again its her problem and ive already done what i was supposed to do. so AITA if i dont go out of my way to track her down and tell her? i have her name but i dont have facebook or other social medias like that either (and their name is kinda generic?)  and its been over four years, i dont feel its my job to tell grown adults they should change their address?"
106,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I don't give my friend her money back?,14,m17tl9,35,"Hello, this is my first post on reddit please be gentle hhhTLDR at the bottom This story has been in progression for about 3 months. It started when my friend gifted me a sum of money for my birthday (about 250$). She got the idea to just send me the money to my bank account after I talked to her about my obsession to reach a certain amount of money to be able to build my own house (I've been working on it for years). I tried giving it back afterwards but she insisted I keep it, so I decided to just do something for her birthday and gift it back discreetly (her birthday is March 16th).Unfortunately we haven't been on the best of terms since. First of all, she began treating me like she owns me. We were supposed to go to the bank because I have a car and I help her with that stuff. But she wanted to go a week before finals (I'm in my final year of med school, I barely have time to shower before finals). Still, I didn't want to be ungrateful so I accepted, only for her to cancel the next day because she has to study. Then finals were over, we were free so we did what we had to do and then went out. The thing is I was robbed that afternoon and she was with me. The robber took only my phone, nothing happened to us physically. But I was very shaken up and just wanted alone time, I had some pretty bad nightmares and was scared to go out for weeks. I spent the whole holiday in my bedroom, alone, not talking to anyone except my mom (occasionally). I couldn't sleep well for 2 weeks. Suddenly she sends me a message about why I'm not talking to her. She thought I was talking to everyone except her. I explained to her that the only reason a mutual friend of ours knew of what happened was because I had to cancel my plans with that friend. Plans we were supposed to have the day after the robbery.Anyways she apologized for misunderstanding then asked for the money back. Honestly I lied and said that I didn't have it anymore. I know I shouldn't have but I was so shocked. I do need it though, and I was going to use it but there has been a slight delay in plans. I promised her to give it back as soon as I have it (more like as soon as I'm sure I won't need to use it). 2 weeks later, she asked me about some lectures that the prof didn't record, I didn't answer right away because I don't wanna send them to her. Especially since she gives them to everyone and I don't want that. When I didn't answer immediately, she said ""at least give me back my money"". I feel like she is holding it over my head (ever since she gave it to me actually). She said this even though I already told her I don't have the money anymore.WIBTA if I don't give it back right away? Should I even give it back? I just want to teach her a lesson, why gift it then want it back? My evil demon and my good angel are fighting hhhh TLDR : My friend gives me money as a gift for my birthday, insists I keep it when I try to give it back. Now she wants it back when I told her I don't have it anymore."
107,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I Told My Boyfriend I didn't Want to Room With His Friend?,8,m1dvt3,37,"Oknay, so me (18) and W (27, boyfriend) have been together for almost a year now, and we both still live with our parents. Recently, we've talked about moving in together due to both of our families either being hesitant to let us stay together/intruding in on our privacy. I respect both his and my parents wishes and we both decided that the best move would be to move in together. We have a great relationship so far, and I really want to start a life and future with him, but here's the problem: He invited his friend, T, to move in with us as well. When W told me, I was initially upset because I wanted to start planning a future with just us. Don't get me wrong, I don't by any means hate his friends or anything but I don't want to become a third wheel. W and T have  known each other for such a long time and talk about everything. When I'm around, I just kind of fade into the background. I don't want that to be an everything thing when we all end up living together. Another reason why I feel bad about not wanting his friend to stay is that T has had a really tumultuous childhood growing up. He lives with his grandmother who is very controlling and I don't want to hinder him finding a way out if that makes any sense.So AITA?Edit: to clarify, my parents know my partner's age gap and have met him and actually really like him. They just don't approve of us staying in the same areas alone within their house which I respect. Also me and my boyfriend met when I was still 18 and I'm going to be 19 soon just to clear that up!"
108,Not the A-hole,AITA for not buying my nieces clothes anymore because the clothes don’t suit my taste?,33,m12zhx,35,"I occasionally buy my nieces clothes, they’re 5 and 7, and usually it is very girly stuff that I buy *but* that is their sort of taste! They love everything pink, sparkly and absolutely love unicorns.I usually do stick to the same type of clothes during the summer which is cutesy dresses but I do make sure the clothes I buy match the season.I’m aware they’re growing up and when they reach say the age of 10 they may not be so into pink but they’re not 10 and they are into it right now.Anyway, it’s my nieces birthday coming up and as usual I thought I’d buy the girls a nice outfit.For my youngest niece I picked out a cute little pink dress with little bees over it, I’m not selling how cute it was, it was cute.But then when I got confirmation from my sister she told me not to get things like that because they’re too young, what you’d see on a baby.The clothes went up to my nieces ages and higher.The clothes list she sent me were all crop tops and camouflage leggings and just not my cup of tea and I KNOW my nieces are into pink more than camo.I just don’t feel comfortable buying my 7 year old niece a crop top and I don’t want to so I backed out of buying the clothes.I’m not going to judge my sister for dressing her children the way she wants but she says I can’t buy clothes for them that are “too young” and then she’s buying clothes that we sure  wouldn’t wear at 13 let alone 7.It’s a big deal now because my family think I can’t just back out of buying the clothes because they’re not what I want to get and because they’re not cutesy.I like buying the cute clothes so maybe I am biased but I just also don’t want to buy them clothes that I don’t see as children clothes.My sister is free to buy her children’s clothes without judgment from me but as I said they’re very much into the clothes I buy for them.AITA?"
109,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I don’t credit my former friend for a song he originally helped on?,6,m1cmb2,24,"A few months ago, my former friend Josh allowed me to record vocals for a song of mine at his place since he lived alone and I couldn’t afford to rent a studio. Between that time and now, Josh and I had a disagreement that concluded with him ending the friendship entirely and removing me from his life.Also between the initial recording and now, I re-recorded the vocals at another friend’s place. I decided to change the key of the song to make it more comfortable for my vocal range. As a result, I didn’t need nor use the vocals I had recorded at Josh’s place anymore.Even though I didn’t use the vocals I recorded with Josh, I feel like I’d be TA if I don’t credit him since he did still allow me to use his place originally which he didn’t have to do. However, since he decided to cut me out from his life I also feel like if I do credit him he’ll demand I remove his name or have his friends and family come at me because he no longer wants to be associated with me. I’ve seen him do so before with friends he had disagreements with, myself included even before this last disagreement.WIBTA if I just don’t credit him at all?"
110,Not the A-hole,AITA for making my BF go to therapy?,42,m12ke0,35,"My boyfriend has recently started reading Gilles Deleuze and he's become utterly incomprehensible. Ever since he has been obsessed with potatoes and nomadic war machines and he has started wearing cat ears. Being unfamiliar with the author's work I have no idea what the hell he is talking about but then he brings up shit like how schizophrenia is a shamanistic trait and how it stymie's the capitalist system's effort to curb desiring production(Again no idea what the hell he is talking about). I have been concerned for his mental health for a very long time and ever since he has started reading Deleuze I feel like he has been deteriorating. After a long talk I have convinced him to go to therapy but he has since called me an ""Oedipianizer"" for trying to have his psychology triangulated and turned towards familiar relations by forcing him to go to therapy. Am I the asshole? I just want to look out for his mental health."
111,Not the A-hole,AITA for not inviting my friend on a trip,120,m0x43h,89,"Hey guys, I'm not really sure what to do about this one. So, in October, I invited my friend Carrie on a road trip to the mountains for a few days. My friend, Megan, ended up getting really hurt that I didn't think to invite her. I apologized, and we made up, and we agreed to go on a trip in the spring. I thought that was that.Last month, my friend Carrie invited me to go on a short trip with her, and I agreed. This week, I reached out to Megan about our trip coming up. We had planned on going on a road trip in May to a National Park to do some camping and hiking. I wanted to secure some of the arrangements to start planning. She kept pushing me off, and saying we would talk about it later. Finally, she told me that she was really upset she wasn't invited on the trip I recently took after what happened in October. I told her my intention was not to exclude her, and that I had been the one invited to it, and I didn't feel comfortable inviting another person to a trip I wasn't planning. She told me she doesn't want to travel with me anymore. I'm not really sure what to do. I tried reaching out to her. I apologized. I feel horrible for hurting her, but I'm also not sure what else I should have done.I might be TA for not giving her warning that I was taking another trip, and telling her why I wasn't inviting her (it wasn't my trip and she doesn't know my friend Carrie that well, so I really didn't feel comfortable inviting her along). What do you guys think? AITA for not inviting her?Update: Thank you everyone for your feedback. I'm sorry I haven't been able to respond to you all. I appreciate all of you. Thank you for helping me realize how unhealthy this is. I've decided to talk to her and let her know she needs to back off and let me make my own plans without consulting her or we are done. I didn't realize how draining this friendship has been until answering some of your questions so thank you all! <3"
112,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting my manager chewed out by his manager?,16,m16txi,9,"Okay so context and a little backstory. I like my job, for the most part. Since December I've been struggling a lot mental health wise and dealing with severe burnout. I have two jobs. I was hired to work 2-3 days a week but this position required 4 which I was fine with. Shortly before Christmas I had a family member pass away and had to switch shifts with somebody to get two days off to drive and attend their funeral and ever since I came back it's been consistently bad. My coworker was out for a minor surgery but then really stretched the time she was gone as much as possible.I took as many shifts as I was able to, I did have to tell them no a couple of times. Burning out fast. When she came back, she put in her two weeks. I didn't find out about this until it was a week away from her leaving. I told my manager (MM) that I can pick up extra shifts but I cannot work saturday (my mother's 3 year death anniversary) . He said alright and I thought that was that. But when I came in after my days off, I saw that I was scheduled that specific day. His manager had done the schedule because he hadn't, and his manager didn't know I needed that day off. I asked MM if there was anything he could do about it, and he said he would see what he could do but no promises.Next day I come in, schedule is the same. Complained to my friends about it. They convinced me to talk to his manager about it. I was iffy about it because it sounded like a terrible idea but so did coming in on saturday. But I was scared of doing that because I know how bad I get on that day. So I did it, I messaged his manager and asked him to call me at his earliest convenience and lo and behold at 7 am he called. I explained the situation and he was immediately mad at me for talking to him about it and not MM. I was willing to just drop it then and there, I'm scared of conflict.He got chewed out by his manager. And now he's mad at me, and I don't blame him. I got him in trouble, when I could have just waited for him to try to deal with the situation. And I think a part of me thought that since his manager made the schedule maybe he could fix it. I do feel very sorry for what I did, her quitting was not his fault and he's working with what he has. I think I am the asshole in this situation, but the people I live with are convinced that it was super unprofessional for both my manager and his manager to lash out at me over this. I am so scared to show up to work tomorrow, I really don't want my manager to be upset with me. At this point I'd rather just work that day and pretend like none of this happened. I don't want to quit, because again I like my job. I like my coworkers, I like MM even. I'm just so burnt out and overworked and I always get super bad on the day and... I don't know. Am I the asshole like I think I am? Or am I just a pushover who lets people walk all over me?"
113,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to do everything around the house?,16,m16cg5,10,"I'm 19yrs old (M) and in my last year of high school, i live alone with my dad (39) and tensions have been running high at home lately. Obviously i go to school, also a school related internship, working on dealing with severe ptsd and manic depression,  i also have a job and two rabbits, a cat, and a hamster that i'm completely responsible for all on my own, both financially and general care wise. Even despite all of that to my dad i'm just a lazy piece of shit, even though without me there nothing would get cleaned up but the moment i leave a single cup on the counter or forget to take out the trash all he does is scold me. ive told him before that im literally physically unable to do everything at once. that learning from home doesnt suddenly mean im sitting in my bed all day doing nothing but he just doesnt get it. it's made my issues worse to the point where ive started relapsing and he just really doesnt seem to be bothered. he's been like this ever since i turned 18, i get taking more responsibility at that age but am i just an asshole  for telling him i cant do it all? ive been genuinely doubting my own feelings lately. I've been thinking about rehoming my pets and trying to move out but my heart breaks just thinking about it."
114,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting to knock the door?,5,m1egz3,19,"hi all, im a longtime lurker here but i need some help with this issue (also on mobile so formatting is bad, apologies).So today its was my (14F) friends birthday and I had gotten her some gifts but because of the lockdown we couldnt meet up so i dmed her asking what time would be alright to deliver her presents, she said that any time suited outside of the discord call we were having (just watching a movie and playing a couple online games) so i asked my mum if she could drive me there and she said yes, she then had to go do something (she didnt tell me what) and that when she was back she would drive me up. And she did at around 6-6:15pmSo this is where i might be the ah i got out of the car to knock on the door and no one answered so i waited for awhile before knocking another couple of times and waiting but still no one showed up so i walked back to the car and told my mum that nobody answered and my mum told me that they were home because some of the lights were on (even though my mum keeps our light on when we're out) at first she told me to phone my friend (which i did, but i got no reply) and then after that she told me to get out and knock on the door again. I didnt want to because i thought i would look weird and would get nervous, but i didnt tell her that, i just told her that  shes obviously not home and even if she is shes not going to answer the door.After telling her this a couple times she shouted at me to get out of the car and stop being such a bitch about it, so i did and knocked the door again and again i got no answer so i came back to the car and my mum told me not to speak to her again tonight and started shouting about how lazy i was for not doing that and how odd i am and a bunch of other things. idk i just feel like an asshole because i shouldve been able to go up and knock the door without an issue but i couldnt and i made my mum drive to my friends house for nothing i feel really bad, please tell me what you think and i'll try to answer questions, if you have anyEDIT: so regarding why my friend didnt answer the door, she texted me to say that her family came over and they were in the backroom so didnt hear me and she apologised"
115,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my friend not to complain about her school work?,4,m1g2vu,10,"I didnt know a better way to word the title, so please read this beofre you judge me.So I have an online friend who we'll call N. N and I live in different countries, she lives in the Netherlands I live in the UK. We were talking about school and such, until N started ranting about how hard her work is. For context N has to do complicated work that to be fair is quite hard, she told me depending on your set you have to do certain subjects and it isnt possible to change them and as she's in quite a high set she has no choice but to do this work. Meanwhile there are kids who can do subjects like cooking, art and sewing or such. N started complaining about this, and said something along the lines of this""I find it so annoying when bitches who get to do things like cooking and stuff complaing about how its SoOO HaRd when it's basically their hobby."" Now keep in mind she said this in a rude tone, mocking the people in a high pitched annoying voice.I was a bit taken aback, I can definitely understand her struggle because its unfair that she has to do boring work she doesnt like yet others can do subjects they're passionate about. But she was rude about it, completely dismissing how hard cooking and such can be. It especially hurt a little because those are my hobbies and the subjects that I picked for my GCSE's, and i can tell you they're not as easy as they seem. You get a mountain of work, and you definitely cant mess around in those classes. I understand that the education system could be different in the netherlands then in the uk but its still hard.I told N I I understood her but those subjects can still be just as hard and mentioned my own struggles I went through. N told me that those people get to do subjects that are their hobbies, and it should be easier for them. I cut her off by saying ""imagine if someone told you you cant complain how hard a math question is because you've been doing complicated work like that for years so it should be easier now.""She got super mad at me and left the call and wouldnt talk to me, she then said that she didnt mean it because she just gets mad over stupid things. I snapped at her and said ""so you got mad and threw a hissy fit because I proved you wrong?"" And now she's uspet at me again. I dont know if I took it too far, one friend said I didnt but I'm not sure. So AITA???"
116,Not the A-hole,AITA for allowing my husband to decide what our kids call his stepmom?,591,m0l5u5,147,"My husband lost his mom when he was 12. His dad remarried when he was 15. My husband is the oldest of six siblings and he is the only one who does not call his stepmom mom. Most likely due to his age at the time of the remarriage. I won't say he doesn't like his stepmom but he definitely resists having a closer relationship with her due to a desire not to be mothered by another person and also I think he feels like at least one of the group of siblings needs to hold that space for just their mom. He accepts that have a different relationship with stepmom but he feels like someone needs to hold on. So he does. He is not particularly close with his stepmom, or his dad when it comes down to it, because his dad feels he should make more of an effort with his stepmom. But anyway, we have two children together. Our older son is 5 and our younger son is 7 months. I let my husband take the lead on what the kids would call his stepmom. She our oldest knows her by first name and she's ""grandpa's wife"". This has caused a stir lately because after about three years of almost no contact my husbands dad is definitely keeping in touch more. Which I believe is down to his stepmom.Anyway, the whole family met in an outdoor setting a few weeks ago to see each other for the first time in a while. It was there my in laws learned that my son calls my husbands stepmom by her first name. This brought up a discussion and my husband told his dad that our boys would always be aware they lost grandma and grandpa remarried. This turned into a fight and then my father in law turned on me away from everyone. He told me as the person who can think more clearly about this I should have discouraged my husband from not letting her be grandma and that I should have at least taught the boys different. He said by leaving the decisions in my husbands hands I knew what I was doing. Which I can't deny. But I also know it's not MY relationship with her that would influence the part they play in our lives. So I don't know.I do feel kinda bad because my husbands stepmom looked devastated when our oldest used her first name and I know she has never been pushy or treated my husband bad. It's just circumstance for why things are the way they are between them.My husband has done therapy btw. I know this will be asked.AITA?"
117,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to share my new portable blender with my mother ?,59,m106qf,25,"So let my explain this as simply as possible. I recently got a relatively cheap,  portable blender because I couldn't afford the one I really wanted.  I've been using it for about a month to make smoothies when I just want a small portion and don't  want to clean up the large blender that I have in the kitchen. I live with my parents, so naturally my mother asks me to make her a smoothie when I'm making one. I didn't mind this at first but after a while she would ask every time or even when I wasn't making one and repeatedly ask me to make one or when I was going to. I want her to eat healthy so I would always make one for her but since this blender is pretty cheap and really only has enough power to make a few smoothies at a time before needing charged again, it defeats the purpose of a portable blender for me. It turns a 10 minute thing into a half hour or longer because the blender gets weak and I have to cut frozen fruit each piece at a time , for my smoothie and the one my mother is asking for. So I have to blend up materials about 5 times for one smoothie. It takes up alot of time and just completely defeats the purpose of a portable blender when im in a rush and want to drink out of it for just myself.  So I decided to save up for the one I actually wanted, its supposed to be stronger and able to crush ice ect, I'm  very excited about it and I told my mom she can have the other one since I won't  be needing it anymore.I thought this was a kind gesture, apparently not. Her response was that she would be using my NEW portable blender to make her own smoothies. I don't have a problem with sharing. My parents have to deal with me living there, but I buy all my own groceries and anything I need. I just can't understand why she has to use my new portable blender when I told her she can have my previous  one AND we have a normal plug in blender as well. Also side note: I buy all the ingredients , fresh veggies/fruits, frozen fruits , soy/rice milk and it all becomes pretty costly.  I find myself running out of these items very quickly since I am sharing with my mother.  I don't  mind but I think she can atleast use her own blender and make her own smoothie if I'm not currently making one, instead of repeatedly begging for one when I am busy.  She is very capable of making her own,  I just don't want to spend my entire night in the kitchen making food and cleaning dishes after work. The idea of a portable blender is to make one drink for one person and even drink it straight out of the blender since it is small. I actually bought the new one because I just wanted something  to myself.  Am I in the wrong here and being selfish ?"
118,Not the A-hole,AITA for expecting my MIL to cook?,6,m1h6gh,17,"She is getting up in her years and told my husband and I that she needed a lot of help at home, so we sold our house and moved into her place, a 120 yr old house on 1.25 acres. It does need some work but nothing major, though the yard does need some maintenance.  In return for moving in, we would take over the mortgage and would get the house when she passes. Its been over a year, and she won't tell us anything about the mortgage other than it's a reverse mortgage. When pressed, she doesn't know the account number, how much the payments are, when they're due or how much is left to pay. She also is very healthy for 73 and lazy beyond belief (we knew that before moving in). Both my husband and I work full time, she doesn't work at all, spends the day surfing the internet, buying Amazon stuff and playing game, yet when I get home, she always asks what's for dinner. We've had this discussion before about us being tired and since she's not working, she can cook. (I buy 90% of the groceries so there's plenty of food in the house) She feels that if I would cook for us when we didn't live there,  I can cook for all of us now. Yes, we are looking to move out, just saving money now for a down payment in a houseAITA?????"
119,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I told my friend I don't enjoy taking to them anymore?,5,m1dcxd,12,"An acquaintance from high school and I became really good friends over the past year. We live hundreds of miles apart now and most of our conversations are through text. Lately anything I say, not matter what, she just answers with an emoji. When she texts me anything she expects a long and drawn out conversation. I get she has issues, a lot, but I'm tired of always talking about her and whatever she wants. I don't feel like a dumping ground and we mostly talk about inane topics, but the second I turn the discussion in any direction that's not the way she wants the conversation is over. I don't want to be a jerk and say anything because things are tough for her but I'm also tired of being dismissed. I don't know what to do and I don't have many friends, she wasn't always like this but now it's like a chore to respond to her and then a kick in the gut when I'm ignored."
120,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for asking for a different handyman from our property manager?,3,m1h2zu,6,"There’s a long list of problems with this guy, so bear with me here. When we first moved in, we filled out the form of damages for the property management company. Among those “damages” were: Two missing screensWeatherstripping on door falling offStorm door handle and lock not workingFireplace screen falls offKnob on closet door falls offShed door missing most screws in the bottom hinge The handyman came by the first time and he took off two screens from two of the windows as templates, as the other windows are the exact same size. He ripped off the weatherproofing at the bottom of the front door saying, “There are four layers of this, I can replace the one strip next time I show up.” He took a picture of the fireplace screen and said, “The property manager has someone else who handles these.” He removed the knob from the closet door (stripped screw) and said he’d return to replace it. He looked at the shed door and basically only said, “Yeah, I see what’s going on there.” Two weeks later, he returns to take pictures of the knob on the storm door, as he’s struggling to find it. He also got a piece of a frame to try in the window and it’s too thick, so it wouldn’t work. He told me he’d have to special order it and went on his way. Yesterday (a week later) he texts me saying the company he uses to make screens doesn’t make them anymore. He told me he’s using a different company, but wants to come by and check that the screens he’d originally removed for templates actually fit the missing windows. I told him we’d measured the windows and they’re identical, but he said he’d want to test them just in case. When I asked about the status of everything else, he said that the fireplace screen can just be thrown away. I expressed issue with this, as the screen is there for safety, but he didn’t address this concern. He said the storm door handle won’t be here for a while, but he can do “the other things” if I’m pressed for time. I attempted to clarify, “Does this mean you’ll also be fixing the weatherstripping on the front door and the closet doorknob?” He says, “I can do multiple things at once if you’re pressed for time, but I still need to test the screens.” Today, he texted me again asking to do this on Friday instead of Thursday because my property manager has another job for him. Would I be the asshole to reach out to the property manager and express how much of our time he’s wasting? My dad did this stuff for a living for over 30 years and thinks this guy is incompetent. Note: We’re still moving in and two of the windows in question are covered in boxes. It’s not as simple as allowing him in I’d have to rearrange the entire room to allow him access to the windows."
121,Not the A-hole,AITA for losing my shit after all my bf could do was talk about... Cinco de mayo??,52,m105pu,48,"This happened last night. I thought I'd go to sleep so I can calm down a bit and maybe I won't feel as PISSED. BUT nope. Still pissed. We are long distance, he's in the US I'm In Asia. We were on video call and I was feeling pretty vulnerable and open with him. It had been a weird day and we were talking about funny childhood moments which led to me talking about the bad parts as well.I started talking about one of THE MOST traumatic events of not just my childhood, my whole life. It still haunts me.I said ""I remember the exact date it happened, 5th May."" and up to this point he was just nodding and humming but the moment I said the date he just perked up and said ""funny, that's on the same day as Cinco de mayo!""And I'm just like ""... Huh?"" and he took that as me not knowing what that is and started explaining in detail what it is and that it's celebrated on 5th May as well.That made me feel so fucking stupid??? Here I was talking about real scary trauma and he just kept talking about a Mexican holiday...?Idk maybe I overreacted but I stopped him mid sentence and asked him why that was necessary. He said ""it was just an observation!""I felt so humiliated and stupid, I couldn't help but start sobbing suddenly and left the call.He has ADHD and said he just makes such observations and ends up saying them out loud sometimes, it ""just happens"". Like... Even when I'm talking about something so scary and traumatizing?? Idk.AITA?Update: we've made up, I talked to him openly and he apologized profusely, we Gucci."
122,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I asked my coworker to stop eating at my desk?,11,m17rcd,26,"So, my coworker and I share a desk since we both work on each others off days. I started 2 years ago, so I already have an established spot with my things, and she started back in November. For reasons, she always brings her lunch and eats it at the desk. We are student workers and we both work at a university. She could eat at her dorm later, as both of us don't work full days (she normally gets off at 3ish).The issue is that she's started getting food everywhere. I won't claim to be the cleanest eater, but there is food dried on my keyboard and my office blanket. I'm a little frustrated that my things are getting food on them.WIBTA if I asked her to stop eating at my desk?Hello! Quick edit, it's kinda hard to explain, it is my desk, but she uses it when I'm not here. When I am here at the same time as her, she uses the desk of our other coworker. She would ideally have her own desk, but because of social distancing, all the desks at my office have been pulled apart and we can't use some of them. Officially, in the office and such, it is my desk that I just so happen to occasionally share.Edit #2: Thank you all for the responses! I'll just ask her if maybe she could wipe down my desk at the end of the day. The blanket has to stay in its current home on the back of my chair for now, but I am going to try to find it a new place. Thank you again! :)"
123,Not the A-hole,AITA for not calling my sister?,19,m14s3e,16,"I haven’t spoken to my sister since January. We used to be close but as adults have taken very different paths. We grew up on the poor side I learned to do without while she’s a bit of a label-chaser. I chose urban education, while she married a finance guy and started her own business. I don’t judge her choices, but they’ve not made life easier for her. She’s going full tilt for 10-12 hour days to make it all work, but her kids and marriage and health are suffering. Instead of paring back, she only increases her workload at work and other projects. Her eldest got waitlisted for a school they didn’t even want to go to, so my sister was freaking out that they’d never get into the *right* kind of school, and never amount to anything.I tried saying that not all kids need to take the path of an expensive “name brand” college, and maybe this child (who has been deeply unhappy and in need of a lot of mental health care), would find a different place that fit them better. My sister spat at me “I bet you want my child to go to a *COMMUNITY COLLEGE*!” and hung up on me. 1) that’s not what I said. I said there are thousands of colleges and maybe this one wasn’t going to be the right fit2) I think there’s nothing wrong with community colleges, especially as someone is getting their legs under them. I decided not to be the one to call her back. She hangs up on me a lot and I’m getting tired of it. Now we haven’t spoken in months. I had lost my job with the pandemic, and I’m finally getting it back. My mother is insisting I call my sister to tell her the good news. I said if my sister wanted to talk to me she could have dialed the phone any time in 2021. My mother is upset, and saying that I just have to understand that my sister is suffering and needs someone to talk to. I believe a lot of her suffering is voluntary, and screaming at the few people who actually talk to her is a poor choice. AITA for not giving in and calling her? (Btw, the kid got into their first choice, which was a big name-brand college, so crisis averted)."
124,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting to clear out old stuff from my late husband?,846,m0gupu,119,"I’ve been with my boyfriend almost 3 years. My husband has been dead for 4. I’m in my early 30s so I don’t think this is odd, especially since my boyfriend (also early 30s) has a 7 year old daughter. He has a past, I have mine.It’s been nice outside so the other day he went into what I affectionately call “Springtime Dad Mode” and wanted to start going through our storage areas. Now, we have a nice house with plenty of storage. I had to move out of my own house so that was stage one of clearance. I tossed SO much stuff. Then after moving in with the boyfriend I did another huge sweep through my stuff.However, I ended up with two storage tubs (regular size, like what you’d get from Walmart) of things from my late husband. I have one or two more that are filled with high school memories. These aren’t dumb things. They’re notes, programs from shows, and when it comes to my late husband a lot of stuff from his funeral.My boyfriend told me I should be going through this stuff again to toss it. I said flat out no. That I’ve been through this process a few times and the things I have I want to keep, for sure, and it doesn’t matter how little it means to him. I’m not putting it out on display, I’m saving it.He said “If it’s not going to be out then why do you need it?” Ok, as though he’d be ok with me framing photos or notes from me and my late husband’s life?Then what hurt: “You need to live in the present and not the past.”I said “Some people can have a healthy combination of both.” We haven’t talked about it since.ETAI have considered bringing out some of the things from storage to put on display since that’s his “reason” but I won’t because his daughter doesn’t know I was married previously and she’s too young to explain that yet."
125,Not the A-hole,AITA for abandoning and refusing to care for my friends because they all have alcohol addictions?,1396,m0dvjf,116,"Edit: Thank you all so much for the kind words, I woke up to my notifications being blasted with responses and it really validated me. Many people suggested to distance which I very much agree with. My closest friend has decided that overly drinking is more important than our friendship, he has decided to continue drinking knowing that it’ll drive me away but that’s his decision I guess. Thank you all, this meant a lot. I’m a female senior in HS and recently my friends (predominantly made up of males) are starting to turn 18 when it’s legal to purchase alcohol, most of my friends have alcohol addictions and they’re still 17.Every time they have a party someone injuries themselves, is extremely sick or shit gets dangerous. One friend who happens to be my closest friend has required stitches to close a wound, basically thrown out of the house for lying to his parents about where he was and coming home/ being drunk at night, exploiting being legally allowed to purchase alcohol, arriving to campus drunk and or hungover, bringing alcohol to school and being extremely overbearing with his emotions towards me. Others have been beyond sick, one girl slept on the concrete with a blanket because she didn’t eat before drinking multiple beers, another was all but passed out over the toilet for 2hrs while I was trying to force feed him water and food because again he didn’t eat before drinking. One tried throwing a party in which they’d all be drinking while he planned to leave his house leaving everyone unsupervised to go to a strip club basically leaving all the drunk people in the hands of me and a few other sober people. The final straw was when we had a very full on night of drunk idiots, the guy was over the toilet for 2hrs, my close friend came home drunk and was “kicked out” of his house the following morning and after all that they were begging in the group chat for someone to drive them to buy more alcohol because they had consumed all of it and none of them were sober enough to drive. I told them all quite harshly that I wouldn’t be there next time to supervise them and basically told them I had enough of the bullshit. Most of them are still underage and they already have alcohol addictions. My closest friend was hit the hardest, he kept asking those at the house “Where’s OP? I want OP, I miss OP” when he tried messaging me drunken words I muted the conversation and went to bed, I woke up to a spam of messages “Do you hate me?” I have yet to respond or talk to him since. I don’t want to spend every party looking after my friends because they have no self control around alcohol, but I feel guilty for just abandoning them because they DO have no self control.I know this post is long but I’m just exhausted. If it wasn’t for his drinking I’d probably be really into one of the guys, but his lack of control is a major turn off and it almost disgusts me to see him in that completely drunken state.  Maybe I’m talking like a sober loser who needs to loosen up a little bit.AITA?"
126,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking someone if they would be willing to be paid for housework?,18,m14dp1,33,"Ok so I have seen similar on here and I need to know if this was an asshole move. This happened over 5 years ago with my ex (partner at the time). I came from upper middle class parents, went to private school and have been told I’m very entitled so this is why I think I might have been the asshole here. I was dating this girl for only around 2-3 months and we didn’t live together but either I would visit her or she would visit me most weekends. I worked full time as a teacher and she was unemployed on disability benefits. I was pretty busy working and paying competitive bridge 3 nights a week and had very little time. So I was paying a house cleaner, a Gardner and a dog walker. I also had 4 housemates at the time (2 couples) so The mortgage on the house was split 3 ways but I covered all bills all the cleaners etc and most household expenses. She kept complaining about not having any money and I’d offer to buy her groceries when I was there and I even paid her rent a couple of times. But she was so angry that I was paying a cleaner, gardener and dog walker when I could do it myself. She fought with me many times over it. So I eventually said, look if it makes you feel better you’re welcome to do the things they do and I’ll pay you the same. And she was so upset about that comment that she didn’t speak to me for a week and kept calling me a huge asshole. So I want to know was I the asshole here? Like I think she wanted me to just do it all myself and then give her the money but I wasn’t willing to do that, especially so early in a relationship."
127,Not the A-hole,"AITA for refusing to get my ,,best friend“ a birthday present?",13,m15zgq,16,"Hello :)I (F18) finished high school last year in June, and since then life changed a lot.Back then, I was in a friend group of four (all girls). We‘ve been best friends for all our high school years (where I live it‘s 6 years) and we used to do nearly everything together, never had major fights or anything. (some smaller ones, but nothing terrible)After we graduated, one of my three best friends became distant and we kind of grew apart as a group (especially with the pandemic because meeting in a group of four in person is really hard/ wasn’t allowed for a while and it was hard to adapt to since we used to see each other nearly every day in school). The friend, let‘s call her Emily, was always known for her ,,cold“ personality back in high school, for saying everything she thinks, for not really caring about the opinions of others and so on. She was always independent, and sometimes a bit rude which I have to admit, caused some problems in our friendgroup. (For example when she voiced out her really honest and direct opinion and a friend of the group took it personally. But that never lasted longer than some days before we went back to normal.) Despite that, she was also super funny and really caring, a side we often got to see while other didn’t, since we were really great friends.So, tbh it is not a shock to see her go her own way after parting ways at our graduation. If one of us becomes super distant, it would be her.Now, almost one year after of our graduation, I‘m not sure if I should continue to view it as ,,her personality“.For almost half a year, we haven’t really heard anything from her. While the three of us still text often and meet up sometimes, she disappeared from our life (she goes on and on posting in her instagram story about her life, but cannot find the time to go write a simple ,,how are you? We haven’t seen each other in a while!“)It‘s always one of us that has to approach her, and when I sent her a card for christmas she said she even felt bad for being such a bad friend. Still, nothing changed after that.While I and another friend of the group, let‘s call her Nina, find it really rude of her to simply throw away a friendship of 6 years like that, my other friend, let‘s call her Lucy, believes it‘s just „the way she is“ and that ,,you have to take the initiative with Emily“.So now, with Emilys birthday coming up, Lucy says it would be rude to just not get her anything after we’ve been friends for so long.My other friend Nina says since Emily doesn’t value our friendship anymore and simply erased us from her life, she does not get a present from her. Nothing.I also don’t intend to get her anything, since I agree with Nina. But Lucy believes we are major AH for throwing away our friendship with Emily, only because we can’t adapt to her personality.AITA? I don’t see a reason for me to continue to treat her like a best friend and send her a card or a gift after she didn’t try to contact us for over half a year."
128,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I told my friend he has to call me when he wants to talk on the phone?,2,m1icvb,20,"Hi, long-time listener, first-time caller. My (40F) friend and former coworker (50M) has this annoying habit of texting me when he wants to talk on the phone. He’ll say something like “Could you call me?” instead of just, you know, calling me, like a normal person. Also, he doesn’t actually text me he picks some random app that we’re friends on (like Instagram, or one time he used LinkedIn) and sends a message through that. He has my number and seems to have no problem actually texting me about other things. And it’s never been an emergency it’s usually about some disagreement at work.I can’t explain why this annoys me so much, but it drives me absolutely crazy. If you want to talk on the phone, just call me, like all of my other friends. If you want to schedule a call, like some of my other friends do (and I’m happy to do that), he can do that. But this “call me when I tell you to call me” thing, combined with using Instagram/LinkedIn/etc. to do it, strikes me as bizarre, and borderline inconsiderate.This person is not receptive to feedback of any kind, no matter how minor or gentle, so I’ve been reluctant to push back. He gets sullen and vindictive when I disagree with him, or when I tell him that I think he’s in the wrong in a work situation. That might be the source of a lot of my irritation.Anyway, I feel like he expects me to be at his beck and call, and that he thinks it’s my responsibility to call him when he wants, and that feels gross. But I also wonder if I’m just getting wrapped up in some difficult history and making too big a deal out of a harmless quirk. WIBTA if I put my foot down and insisted that he just call me when he wants to talk?"
129,Not the A-hole,AITA for walking out on my mother every time she smokes in front of me?,402,m0llv2,72,"Long story short: my mother refuses to go outside to smoke. She smokes in the living room, the bathroom, the kitchen, and even the dinner table, while the rest of us are still eating or finishing up our meal.I've told her countless times that I do not like it when she smokes around me, yet she continues to do so. So, whenever she takes out a sigaret, I just walk away. She refuses to listen to me, so I have to take my health into my own hands and remove myself from the (literally) toxic situation.The thing is though, she often smokes right after dinner, whilst she expects us to clear the table (& walk through the smoke countless times) to prepare for the dishes. But when I run off, I'm not helping her with those chores, and I do kinda feel guilty about that. But then again, I just feel like she could easily respect my wish to not smoke when I'm near.AITA?Edit: as I'm getting this question a lot: I'm in my early twenties, but I have a sister who's a minor, living in the same  house"
130,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my sister her body hair is ruining her dates?,17347,m056a0,1554,"Bad title, hear me out.My sister (22F) and I (26F) both have PCOS. As a result we have very thick, dark body hair and facial hair that can honestly rival some men’s. I personally choose to shave regularly because I can’t stand how it looks and feels. My sister used to shave but about a year ago decided she wanted to stop. Of course I support her 100% and think she’s beautiful! What she does with her body is her business.However, there is an issue. My sister uses old pictures of herself back when she was shaving on dating apps. This has led to a lot of problems in her romantic life. She often complains she never gets a second date and sometimes people even leave mid-date. I think this is kind of her fault because she’s being disingenuous about her appearance which is a shitty thing to do. I have always bit my tongue and just supported her about this topic until recently.The other day she was venting again about another failed date. She asked me why this keeps happening to her. I told her she should consider updating her profile pictures. She got defensive and asked why she would need to do that. I told her that it would probably help so people know what she looks like since she looks a lot different than when they were taken. She started getting extremely angry and said that “a little body hair doesn’t make that much of a difference” and “the right person won’t mind a little hair.”Again, our body and facial hair is very thick and dark, and (imo) definitely makes a difference. When I don’t shave, I get a full mustache and beard, and my sister is the same. The people she’s going on dates with aren’t expecting her to show up with a full mustache and beard because her pictures show her clean-shaven.I told her that she’s beautiful but she’s giving people false expectations which is why she’s having bad luck dating. She should just be honest from the start and the right one will come along! But she was infuriated and said I was being unsupportive and misogynistic. She has refused to talk to me since and my family is now calling me an asshole too because they think I was shaming her. My sister even posted on social media that “body hair is beautiful, the stigma attached to it is misogynistic, it sucks when your own family won’t support you.”Did I go wrong somewhere here? I love my sister and don’t think body and facial hair is a bad thing at all! But I don’t think it’s right to basically catfish people and then blame them for not being interested, and treating them like they’re horrible people when you misled them...AITA?"
131,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling someone that I was playing with another friend?,3,m1f3ag,14,"Ok, so the title might be a bit weird, and I’ll try explain it the best I can, though I am very close to tears right now.I was playing with one of my friends, let’s call them Jay. I was playing with Jay on No Man’s Sky and then my best friend (her fake name shall be Emmy.) texted me, asking if I wanted to play with her. I replied that I couldn’t play then, not mentioning that I was playing with Jay, which would probably be my biggest mistake. Emmy said alright and to text her if I could play. I continued to play with Jay.Before I go onto the next bit, Emmy does not like Jay. So normally I’d play different games with Jay, then with Emmy, and they were alright with this. Jay can be a bit mean to Emmy, but I know he doesn’t mean it. It’s his way of showing that he likes people. Emmy doesn’t take it very well. When I’m playing with one of them, and the other one asked to play, I’d normally say that I was playing with the other person. Jay usually understands, and asks if we could play the next day. Emmy gets a bit upset, but gets past it. I said I couldn’t play with Emmy and didn’t mention Jay was because it was quicker to type, and Jay and I were battling sentinels.Fast forward a bit, I was now playing something different with Jay, but my sister joined in as well. Emmy texted me, asking if I could play again, and I said I couldn’t. Emmy said that she saw I was online and playing with Jay, and then said I was lying. I said that I couldn’t play with her at that moment because I was playing with Jay. Emmy called herself a rat, and said that I clearly didn’t want to talk to her. I apologised and said that I should’ve told her I was playing with Jay. Emmy said that I don’t need to apologise, and that she should just shut her big mouth and leave. I said that I do need to apologise, but she never responded to me.I never mentioned any of this to Jay or my sister, and we just continued playing. I felt incredibly guilty and I was nearly crying. I was called down to dinner, and I struggled to keep myself from crying while eating. I didn’t tell my parents about what happened, what didn’t help is that they kept asking about Emmy. When I finished dinner, I went upstairs and am now writing this. This happened around an hour ago, and my sister is now playing with Jay, while I’m by myself.I’m scared that I just lost my best friend, and what tops it, is that she is also my crush. I’ve liked her for a while now, but never had the guts to say anything, and I’m afraid that she wouldn’t accept me for being bisexual. I also think she’s straight, so that’s another reason.Am I the asshole?Update: Thank you everyone! Due to your suggestions and pointing me out on my bullshit, we are now friends again! I am working on becoming a better person!"
132,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my roommate's guests use my bathroom?,167,m0rq90,72,"I'm a 24M and my roommate is 24F. We live in a 2 Bed 2 Bath apartment. She has the master bedroom with an attached bathroom and I have the other bedroom with the bathroom directly across the hall from my room, but it's still my bathroom that I clean and that has all of my stuff in it. We split rent roughly like 60/40 because obviously she has more space than I do. We've never had any issues before this.My roommate told me that she has 2 friends (both 23F) who will be crashing on our couch for a few days. I just said ok, I have no problem with that and I probably won't see them much anyway. She also told me they'll be using the hallway bathroom. I immediately told her no, it's my bathroom. She told me that bathroom is communal, considering it's in the hallway. She said that everyone knows that the hallway bathroom is always used as the guest one. I told her again, NO. It's literally my bathroom, and I don't want her guests using it. If I had guests over, they'd use mine. Since these are her guests, they should be using her bathroom. My roommate said her bathroom is literally on the other side of her room, and that the hall bathroom is the communal one anyway.I told her, you know what, fine, if *my* bathroom is considered communal all of a sudden, I'll be paying less rent then. I told her we split costs based on rooms and baths, and we use the shared spaces equally. If suddenly I don't have a private bathroom, and I ONLY have a bedroom that's private, I will not be paying anywhere near what she's paying for her own bedroom and bath. It's not fair. She refused and said that her friends are just guests, and they should have access to the communal bathroom. Neither of us are letting up, her guests will be coming soon, and I have a headache for days. Now I'm starting to question everything and I just don't know anymore. AITA for not agreeing that my bathroom is communal just because it's in the hall?EDIT:I didn't expect many people would see this in such a short time but I'm really glad I got to read these before I had to go to work. To clear up something: my roommate has always considered this bathroom mine too. She's had guests before and every single time they've always used her bathroom up until now, because she said before it was my bathroom. This is the first time she's ever used the words ""communal bathroom"". Secondly, I will say one of the comments kind of hit the nail on the head with mentioning the whole COVID thing- I genuinely wasn't sure if I was allowed to mention it for risk this post would be taken down? (I don't even know if I'll get flagged for making this comment?) I told her I wasn't comfortable sharing a bathroom with people I don't know while I'm not even sure if they're safe. Either way, though, I see a lot of comments bringing up a lot of good points and I'm going to be talking to my roommate more about this when she gets here. I don't want to have any more conflicts with her, since I do like living with her, and I want to be sure we're on the same page in what we're comfortable with. I want to talk to her about splitting rent more fairly if that's the case, or maybe asking her friends to shower in her bathroom if they can. Thanks for the comments, guys."
133,Not the A-hole,AITA for expecting my ten year old niece do chores once a week?,20,m13001,52,"I live with my 79 year old mother and 10 year old niece. It's a hassle getting the ten year old to do chores and my mom thinks we're asking too much of her and I'd like to know if I'm being unreasonable.The chores are broken into four different things and once a week she picks two and I pick two. Categories are kitchen (sweep floor, wipe stove, countertops, etc), bathroom, vacuuming living room and dining room, and vacuuming halls and stairs.We have two cats so when vacuuming, all of their toys need to be picked up and moved. For example, I'll pick up everything in the dining room and move it to the living room. I'll then vacuum the dining room, and do the same to the living room so everything is actually getting cleaned. My mom thinks this is expecting too much, and I think it's the bare minimum. What say you Reddit?"

135,Not the A-hole,AITA for accidentally spoiling a book that my friend didn’t want to read anyway?,57,m0xlzj,27,"My (17f) friend, H, (17f) has to read 1984 (George Orwell) for her English class and was talking about the essay she has due in a few days. She said she didn’t really like the book and wanted to finish it. My other friend (17m) and I have both already read the book and while H was talking with some of our other friends, we were talking about the ending. I hadn’t noticed that H had come back up behind the two of us and overheard what we were talking about. She didn’t say anything until after our conversation was over, and now she’s upset and won’t talk to me or our other friend because we ruined the ending. I think she’s being a little unfair, considering we didn’t know she was there and then she didn’t bother to stop us talking when she heard what we were discussing. Was I wrong?"
136,Not the A-hole,AITA For Not Sharing My Inheritance With My Sister?,3097,m08rqd,854,"Throwaway AccountOkay, I'll be the first to admit that I can let my emotions get the better of me and I know it's not my sister's fault, but this is all still so raw for me.I (22f) recently lost my paternal grandma and I'm heartbroken. The first eight years of my life she was my primary caregiver because my parents both worked full time and we had a special bond. During summer I had hadn't washed my hands properly and accidentally stained one of her books she had. It was part of a collection that she had started when she was a little girl and I got really scared. I cried, thinking my grandmother would hate me, and hid the book. When my parents picked me up I told them what I had done and they said that they would handle it. Later they sat me and my sister (18f) down and told us that grandma decided that she didn't want to be a grandparent anymore and not be apart of our lives.I thought my grandma was angry about the book and hated me. I was devastated and cried hard and begged my parents to let me see her and apologize. They wouldn't do that and told me it would get better in the future and that I still had my maternal grandma, but it wasn't the same. We moved away not too long after that and I spent the rest of my formatives years worrying that if I ever made a mistake people would stop loving me. As a teen I wanted to reach out to her again but my parents either tried to persuade me not to or said that they would pass the message along for me, but got no response.Now I know that my parents are the biggest liars on the planet. Turns out that my mom cheated and my sister wasn't my dad's bio kid. In the beginning my dad was going to leave them both but decided to stick it out, my grandma wasn't happy but supported his choice to stay with my mom and would babysit my sister too, but she did not want to take a Grandmotherly role in her life. Eventually, my parents gave her an ultimatum either she be a grandmother to my sister too, and love us equally, or she'd never see me again. My grandma called their bluff and they followed through. All this time I thought my grandma didn't love me anymore and that I was the cause of it but it had nothing to do with me. I was furious and moved out a few days later.I finally reached out to her myself and by then she was sick and died a few months later. I'm glad that we were able to spend some time together and was surprised that she left me some money. Like pay off all my Student Loans, buy a decently used car and still have some later over. My parents found out and they want me to share it with my sister. I was upset by this and reminded them of the damage they caused me and the years I lost with my grandma, and that the money doesn't make up for it. I told them that just because they put themselves and my sister before me doesn't mean I have to put them before me too and wasn't going to give her a cent. My parents are calling me petty and selfish but given the circumstances it's falling on deaf ears but on the off chance, AITA?Edit: Sorry spelling errors.Edit 2: Okay just wanted to add in more information because I keep seeing the same question/comments1. This isn't about punishing my sister. I know she's innocent in this and that my mom deserves the majority of the blame. I don't want to share the money because my parents showed no remorse for what they did to me and demanded that I share.2. Yes my sister knows that another man is her bio dad. He and his mother are still alive, so if my sister wanted to, she could have a loving relationship with two grandmothers while I mine is still dead. It basically salt in the wound right now.3. The affair was discovered before my sister was born so my grandma didn't just one day stop loving my sister like a granddaughter, she never had that bond in the first place.4. One of the things my grandma and I talked about was her reluctancy to view my sister as her granddaughter. Her reasoning was that she didn't want to get too attached on the off chance that things went wrong. She did not think my parents' marriage would last and that's why she called their bluff.5. For years my grandmother tried to reach out to see me but my parents refused. It was one of the reasons why we moved, so she couldn't find us or send me letters.Edit 3:1. Also, again, I told my parents about the book so they knew that I thought my grandma hated me over it and had no problem letting me live on like that.2. My sister was around 4 when we stopped seeing my grandma so she doesn't really remember her and I honestly think she doesn't care about the relationship. Especially since she's closer to our maternal grandmother."

In the middle of my exam I politely told her to stop messaging my sister because I was having an exam, and they were supposed to pay attention to what the teacher was saying. 10 minutes later I got fed up because they had continued to message each other, so I messaged ""shut up."" Later my sister started screaming at me because her friend thought, *she* had sent the message.

138,Not the A-hole,AITA for evicting my Friend over his choice in women.,300,m0kmnw,53,"  I have a house and a friend (Let call him Tyler) of mine wanted to move in, I had the extra room, so I let him move in with very few conditions. The biggest one was:If you want to bring a different girl home every night, that's fine. However, this isn't your love nest. If you are seriously dating someone, 3 nights a week. If you want to play house, get your own house.Late December, this girl (Let’s say Marla) who just started working at his place of employment flirts with him a bit. They are talking, and Tyler wants to start dating her. Which she takes him up on, the day before she got evicted from her apartment. Also, Marla has a house about an hour away from us, that was raided by the cops for being a heroin den. Has no front door or running water. Marla said she was too nice to some friends. Her backstory is a long and convoluted shit show. She lost her main form of income (stripping) because of Covid.I make it clear to them both she is over-staying her welcome. She practically moved herself in. She is nice and friendly, but I don't like strangers in my house 24/7. Tyler’s father just had knee surgery. Tyler got asked to stay at his parents to help his dad for three weeks. She is also staying there with him. A week later, he finds a syringe in the bathroom, she fesses up to a $100/day fentanyl habit. He gives her an ultimatum to get her own place to live in two weeks. That night she totalled her car (she had just started stripping again) and injured her leg. No more transportation and no more job.I am of the mindset of ""You can never trust a junkie"" and have been burned in the past by it, I won't be fooled again. My roommate is one of my best and longest friends, I have known him since grade school. I gave him the ultimatum her or me. She is completely persona non grata in or around my home. If he returns to my house in two weeks, and I see her at the house, I will promptly give him a notice to leave. Tyler, who is a waiter, walked off his job of 3 years because he didn't want to sit a table of 20 during COVID. He has not paid me rent since January now. I know when he gets another job, he would make it right, and I don't NEED the money to survive, but it did make things easy.I will gladly accept his friendship when this all falls apart. But I can't help him now. Junkies need to hit rock bottom by themselves, or they will just drag everyone with them.Now, in her defense, all the ills that have been beset her could just be coincidence, and she has been nothing but sweet and caring to me. My roommate has made her go to the methadone clinic, which she is now doing. So she has given no evidence that she is untrustworthy."
139,Not the A-hole,AITA for removing my mom from Disney plus?,470,m0h7rf,74,"So this is a secondary account. Since my family knows of my main again. Also I'm on mobile if anything looks odd I(27f) got into an argument with my mom(46f) about 1 month ago, due to me not telling her what is in the bank account I share with my dad (55m). After that argument my mom blocked me on everything, Facebook, phone, text, whatsapp, even a game we play. My mom then blocked my husband as well.  Which I don't understand. I have spoke to my father and brothers(36m and 23m) about this and how I'm not okay and it's not okay for my mental health and it's not how a mother should treat their child, because I don't want to disclose money with her( mom will always sprends everyone else's money , but will not fork out her own money and is pretty secretive over her money) Last night I got an email from my Disney plus saying ""op, mom set a pin on her account"" I don't think it's right that she blocked me on everything else, refuses to speak to me, but wants to use the service I pay for. So I signed out of all the accounts. Places pins on my brothers and dad's accounts (my profile has a pin on it) and deleted her account. I guess she found out shortly after, since my brother sent me a message saying ""you need to fix this shit right now op"" I told my brother that "" I'm not apologizing, because the only reason why she is fighting with him is because she can't use the service I pay for. "" My husband thinks I'm doing the right thing because this is not the first time mom has done this to me and thinks it's good I'm finally standing my ground to her.  I do want to know AITA for removing her account?Edit So the reason why I share account with my dad is because my dad has had money issues with my mom before.

140,Not the A-hole,WIBTA If I threw away something sentimental of my FILs?,29,m10h72,28,"My FIL is a self-proclaimed vagabond and after many years of bankruptcy and couch surfing, he has met and married a nice lady in Florida. Right now he is still couch surfing here in Australia, and we don’t see him much at all. For some context, he and my now deceased MIL split up when my husband was 12, and to say his relationships with his kids has been fraught with difficulty would be putting it nicely. He suffers from bi-polar and for the entire 15 years my husband and I have been a couple, he doesn’t medicate properly or at all sometimes. The relationship is very awkward for my husband, who tries to maintain an open door to his Dad, but has confided in me over the years that he really struggles with his Dad trying to force a friendship when they haven’t really had a good relationship over the years. My FIL plans to move to the USA when Covid settles. For approximately 4 years we’ve had the contents of my MIL’s estate in our possession. Husband has 2 brothers, younger, one of which lives in Europe and the other in a small apartment. So it’s fallen to us to store the mothers family possessions. One of these items is this fairly large model boat. For scale, it’s about 4 foot long by 1 foot wide. My FIL built it with the youngest son when he was a teen. Each time we have moved house, we have tried to ask FIL if we can either donate it, toss it, or if he has any plans to collect it. (He lives interstate.) and he repeatedly says he doesn’t want it gone, because it’s important and sentimental of his relationship with the youngest son. To add to this dynamic- the youngest son won’t speak with my brother (inheritance issues from his side, not ours, we are always trying to invite him back into our lives where we can) and to be honest, I’ve had enough of my family home being the hoarding spot for the dramas of my husbands family. My husband feels the same, but whenever the subject comes up with FIL, FIL lays on the emotional manipulation very hard, and makes my husband feel guilty over wanting to get rid of this stuff. We are about to move into our new home which we have spent the last 5 years working our butts off for, and I want a fresh start. I don’t want to drag all the family junk with us, and I’d really like to get rid of this giant model boat which is taking up space in my closet. We will have a lot of space in the new place, but my desire to get rid of it is more to claim OUR family space and get rid of the emotional baggage we are literally storing in our garage, shed, closets and home. So tell me WIBTA if I threw the boat away?"
141,Not the A-hole,AITA Went to Professor about Disruptive Student,23,m11hed,17,"Edit: Thank you everyone, i really appreciate the the input and kind comments. My anxiety has been crazy high since reading all of the group's messages, so i really appreciate the confirmation that I did the right thing.------------------------On mobile, sorry if format is wonky.In my online foreign language class, we have a student who is probably what you would call the class clown. Logically speaking, i can see that a lot it stems from social awkwardness. I'm not by any means judging him, as I am definitely in that same boat.However, he has taken to playing random music videos in the background of his zoom during class, wearing costumes, doing a light show, and has started accepting song requests in the group.me. In the past couple of days, he has also mentioned that he got a soundboard specifically for the class and something about showing off ddr videos in the background as well.Most, but not all, of the other students in the group.me have been outwardly supporting him and egging him off. There are a few of us, however, who aren't really impressed as it's very distractive during class. A class which has fewer weeks in the semester and is very fast paced. While I can't speak for the others who agree with me, i know for myself that I was too scared to directly say anything to the student as he had so much support.As more and more ideas came pouring out of him and others, i finally gathered the nerves to message.... The professor. I told her that I understand I was probably being melodramatic, but I was very concerned that it would effect mine and others learning capabilities while in class.She messaged me back staying that she had noticed some of his antics but was surprised that he was planning to do more, especially as she had spoken with him prior, and that so many supported him. She said she would message him and that was the last I heard of it.(Please let it be known that I did not name anyone who supported him or egged him on, only this particular individual.)A few hours later however, he came back to the group chat and complained that a student wrote to the Professor instead of going directly to him. He was annoyed thinking the professor would call on him more now, esp. as he is not at all versed with the material and is convinced he is failing every assignment (or maybe actually is, I'm not sure). He also complained of wasted money spent on the soundboard.Immediately other students chimed in asking him questions and calling me a rat and a fun sucker. I was too scared to say anything all night and just let them talk amongst themselves (though now I think of it, that alone might help narrow it down who I am as I was one of the few to not say a single thing yesterday....)Everyone was extremely upset, and now I'm concerned that maybe I really was in the wrong and should have just kept my mouth shut and dealt with it.So reddit, please set it for straight. Am I the asshole?"
142,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my husband that we can't get his dream car?,345,m0inyr,123,"My husband and I are both fans of the show Supernatural (at least the first handful of seasons for me). In the show the main characters drive a 1967 Impala, which my husband has always said that he really wants to have one someday and that it's his dream car. I agree that it's a cool car but I've never felt a particular need to have one myself.We're currently driving an '03 Camry and it's about time for it to be replaced. My husband sees this as the opportunity to spring for the Impala, I am telling him there is no way.1. I have been roughing it for years in this car and now that we can finally upgrade he wants to get something much older than what we already have.2. Because it's famous from the show, these cars are extremely expensive. He said we can save money by getting a slightly different version (i.e. the 2-door model when the one on the show is a 4-door) to which I say well what is the point of dealing with all of the downsides of the car and not even getting the upside of it being *the* car?3. It is very important to me to have a car with modern safety features.He says the solution here is to get the Impala as ""his"" car and then we can spend ~3k on ""my"" car. In total that's already way more than I wanted to spend on a new car, and I don't think it's fair at all that I would get saddled with another beater just so he can get what I feel is essentially a toy for himself. In my view it's a waste of money to get two cars when we only need one and we only make 55k a year combined. I know he desperately wants this car but I just cannot bring myself to agree to any of these compromises. AITA?"
143,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling a veggie I was eating a bacon sandwich?,10,m13t73,39,"In UK for context. I’ve (F51) been chatting to a prospective date (M50)over the internet/WhatsApp for a while. His bio said he was a veggie but we’d never actually discussed his choice of lifestyle. We got on really well and chatted about a couple of topics we didn’t agree on. I’m a Christian/he isn’t. He’s an antivaxxer/ I’m not. On both occasions I’ve said my decisions are personal to me and I wouldn’t shove my beliefs down anyone else’s throats. I’m a live and let live kind of person. He agreed. We were chatting on WhatsApp yesterday while he was working and I was walking with my adult daughter in a beauty spot. I’d bought a bacon sandwich at the snack van and told him I was just sitting ‘eating a bacon sarni’. He didn’t respond and I assumed he was busy with work. He didn’t message throughout the evening but again I assumed he was busy. I messaged him later about a voice call...no response. I messaged this morning to check he was ok as we’ve messaged a lot since ‘meeting’’ and I was worried something might have happened. No response and then his WhatsApp profile picture disappears. I know this happens when someone blocks you (not from personal experience!) and was surprised. Had a little think about it and looked at the last thing I said and it suddenly dawns on me that his dating bio said he was veggie. We’d not discussed it at all but I can only assume my bacon comment offended him. I iPhone messaged him to apologise and that message was delivered. He can’t have thought to block my number, just my WhatsApp. I wished him all the best but AITA for mentioning bacon?"
144,Not the A-hole,AITA for buying a cheap washing machine for my wife to use when we have enough money for an expensive one?,704,m0dcgc,522,"I'm a 35-year-old man, and I work full-time in a corporate environment. My wife is 26, and she stays home taking care of the house. We are both happy in this situation.When we got married two years ago, I had a washing machine that I used as a bachelor. It was a high-quality washer/dryer combo that I imported from Japan, and it cost me over $2500. I wrote the English translations on it for my wife and taught her how to use it. Within six months of her becoming a stay-at-home wife, she started complaining about clothes not drying, about it giving her errors, and so on. I gradually realized over time that she was stuffing too many clothes into it, or not cleaning the filter frequently enough. She insisted it was a faulty piece of machinery, so eventually we agreed to sell it to a repair shop and buy a new one.This time, I dished out $3000 for a model from South Korea. It was fairly close to being the top of the line as far as washing machines go, and my wife was very happy. Months later I realized she was still doing the same things--stuffing too many items in to push the button and set/forget it, not cleaning out the filter, and not really doing any of the necessary maintenance. Predictably within a year of buying it, it catastrophically overflowed. We called a repairman who miraculously fixed it, but another few months of my wife doing the same things later, it completely broke.Last Sunday, we did some online shopping for a new one. I was fed up, so I told her that we weren't going to buy an expensive one. She argued that we had the money, but I said I wasn't going to spend thousands on a machine that she was going to break in a year. While shopping for it, she eventually got frustrated and left the room, telling me to ""do whatever [you] want.""So I bought a decent washing machine. It was inexpensive, had good reviews, and has been a popular model since its release. It came a few days later, and I installed it myself. My wife refuses to touch it, and she's still sulking. I've been doing what laundry I can, and she's furious at me for making a ""big financial decision"" myself. Am I being an asshole here?Edit: thanks for all the responses everyone. I have determined I was NTA because the only people who think I was the asshole are posting emotionally-charged nonsensical rants about how my marriage is apparently in shambles. Have a good day!"
145,Not the A-hole,AITA Trying to pick up my kittens,103,m0ptv0,59,"We adopted a pair of kittens from a local rescue two weeks ago. People usually pick up the kittens the day of meeting them, but ours were due to be spayed that day, and we were told to come back in a few days to pick them up. That was last Sunday.Tuesday am the rescue called and said the kittens might need to stay an extra week if they test positive for a bug that was going around, and they needed to collect a fecal sample and would let me know.When I offered to pay for prophylactic antibiotics, or to take the kittens to my vet, the rescue declined. They told me that they would be back in touch with me to let me know a timeline. This was last Tuesday.I texted them the next day just to check in and see how they were doing and if there was any movement. She said she would check ""right now,"" but did not answer my text.A day went by, and noon on Thursday, I texted to check in again, and she said that they weren't sure which kittens were infected, but once they tested my kittens, she would let me know more. She made it sound like they wanted my kittens out before they too got infected.I texted them again this morning (Monday) just to check-in, and they told me that my kittens were in the middle of an antibiotic treatment. So this means that they did get sick, but the rescue didn't say anything to me about it. They said that the kitten should be ready by Thursday.I then explained that my mother-in-law has planned to accompany me to drive to the shelter (it is a two hours drive from my house), and I asked the shelter if I can go ahead and tell her that Thursday is likely the day.The shelter didn't respond to my question on timing.I also, you know, work, so I also need to plan my week. I can't just drop everything for five hours to go get kittens. I get that they are on antibiotics, but I can administer and I don't see why it is so hard to look at a calendar and give me a date.I think I might be the asshole because I keep pushing for a time to pick up kittens that are still undergoing medical treatment and because I keep texting the adoption coordinator when she told me that she would call me when she's ready to. Am I the asshole?"
146,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting people in my landlord’s apartment?,267,m0iby4,34,"First of all, English is not my first language so please bear with me.First things first, I rented out this apartment exactly one month ago. Some days ago my landlord contacted me saying that there will be an upcoming renovation of the entire building. And by upcoming he literally meant it starts the next day. This already made me super annoyed because I just recently rented this place and he didn’t say anything at all, I find it hard to believe that he didn’t know anything until now. I have a newborn and moved in there when she was a couple of days old so if I knew about renovation there is no way I would be picking this place.. I already lived through renovation during my pregnancy and it was super noisy, I had to keep windows and curtains closed all day. I literally had to run out a couple of times out of the apartment and walk outside for a couple of hours because I couldn’t tolerate the noise, but with the newborn, I can’t just ran out of the door, it takes time to get her ready, what if the weather is terrible, etc.Anyway as annoyed as I was with the entire situation I didn’t say anything about it to my landlord until today. He called me and said that the workers would like to access my balcony from inside since it’s easier. I told him there is no way in hell it’s going to happen, I won’t let some maskless strangers into my home during the pandemic, I already tolerate the noise, and my baby sleep is constantly ruined because of it. They can access the balcony from the outside. Then he goes like “you mean my home”. So then I became furious and my have called him a selfish prick for not letting me know about renovation beforehand, and yes it may be his place but I am paying to stay here and we have a contract.So now he blames me for making the job for workers much harder and being a terrible tenant. Which I would argue against since I am taking good care of the apartment, I painted all the walls at home out of my pocket and cleaned the apartment well before moving in since some places were quite nasty..Anyway AITA?"
147,Not the A-hole,AITA for fixing the sink?,58,m0tfs0,34,"I (27F) recently had a new roommate (Jamie, 22F) move in. Her boyfriend Tommy (22M) stays over a couple nights a week. This morning, I went downstairs to make coffee and noticed the sink was backed up, it had a small amount of water and food scraps in it. I tried to unblock it with a plunger and with some baking soda and vinegar, but neither helped more than minimally. I also turned on the garbage disposal but it was just making a little humming noise. I texted Jamie letting her know to avoid using the sink until I can figure it out. She responded saying Tommy could look at it in the afternoon (he was staying over last night and tonight he'd gone with her to her work, which is a gym) and I sort of thought to myself, whatever, one less chore for me to do.Evening came and he had been at the house for a few hours in the afternoon but didn't do anything to the sink that I could see - it was still nasty and backed up. So I got to work on it because I can't just not have a kitchen sink, not to mention I plan to buy a house in a couple of years and want to practice doing basic fixes like that. I tried the other stuff again to no avail, then remembered that I had at some point seen a little metal thing that I vaguely understood had something to do with the garbage disposal. I found the little metal thing and saw that it fit right into the bottom and turned to the left, and bam the water drained. I texted Jamie letting her know I fixed the problem. Tommy, however, was sulking because apparently it emasculated him that I didn't ""give him the chance"" to fix it. He's still pouting because he didn't get to look manly in front of his girlfriend, even though he may not have even known how. Was I the AH for not giving him the chance to?"
148,Not the A-hole,AITA (m22) for moving out of the house that I’ve been renting with my older brother? (M24),77,m0rgr4,24,"I lived with my dad and my older brother in a 3 bedroom house for a while, but when I was 19 and my brother was 22, my dad decided to move out of state. My brother and I took up the responsibility to pay rent and utilities, but the house is way too expensive for him and I. My brother lost his job more than a year ago, and since then he had been late on rent multiple times, causing us to be late on rent.I work around 40 hours a week to cover my share of the rent and to pay the bills, but all he seems to want to do is smoke weed and play video games, refusing to get a job. I have realized that he is a bit toxic, and not someone who is positively influencing me. He has made me late on rent and utility bills multiple times, causing my dad to have to take up his half of rent.On February 4th, I had enough, and told him that I will be moving out.It is now March 8th, and I have found a place to live, but he has not made any effort to get a job or find a place to live. The new person I’ll be living with seems to be a very good influence, and the location is in the downtown city so it will force me to grow as a person.I will be moving out on April 1st, and I am concerned that he will end up homeless, but I can’t take care of him anymore, I feel like it’s not my responsibility to have to take care of my older brother. Between my dad’s anxiety and my brother’s apathy, I have become extremely stressed out.Am I the asshole for moving out of the house? I told him at the start of February that I would be moving out, so he will have had a collective total of around 56 days to have made an attempt to find new housing by April 1st.Thank you,And I appreciate any insight.I think I might be the asshole because I gave him about 55 days of notice, this might seem like not a lot of time to find a job and housing to some people."

In short, Sam has been a nightmare to live with lately. she got a new boyfriend (been about 3 months) and has decided she wants him to move into our apartment. They basically treat the space like their own already and she constantly picks fights with me and our other roommate (23f). It’s gotten to the point where our third roommate has decided to end their friendship and move out in May. I already had plans to move in with my boyfriend in July, and advancing our relationship is important to me and I don’t want that plan screwed up because she’s decided everyone needs to prioritize her having a boyfriend. I told her that I do not want him to move in after our third roommate leaves, and that I would appreciate the time to see my plans out as is. I WFH and basically live in my room.

150,Not the A-hole,AITA for not going along with my girlfriend's lie on her family zoom call?,5935,m02l7b,357,"I (22M) was invited to my girlfriend's (21F) extended family's zoom call where everyone eats dinner ""together"" and then plays games. As we were eating they were mostly talking amongst themselves and then one of her aunts said to me ""I've heard a lot of good things about you. I'm told that you're an engineer. So is my husband."" He asked me what field of engineering I was in as he is an electrical engineer at a major firm.I was a little confused at this point because that's not true. I work in the maintenance department at a children's hospital and I'm a Building Maintenance Tech. I went to trade school for building maintenance right after high school and what I told my girlfriend was that I always wanted to pursue my Bachelor's but only after I've had time to save toward it (I do not want to take out loans). I told him ""Actually I'm a building maintenance tech at xyz hospital, but I'm considering my employer's tuition reimbursement program because I want to apply to mechanical engineering programs this year.""It got really awkward and her uncle was nice about it. Her uncle and her dad started asking me questions about what work was like in a hospital setting for non-clinical personnel at this time and the conversation went in that direction. She chimed in when they asked her about school and her post-grad plans but was pretty quiet. After the call she called me on FT and said that it was ""basically the same thing"" and I said if it's basically the same thing, then why did you lie about it. She explained that her aunts could be classist and that it would've been better if I had just gone along with it because I made her look stupid in front of her family and that her aunts probably think less of both me and her now.I told her that I like what I do, it keeps a roof over my head and I've been fortunate to keep my job this entire time...all without having a college degree yet. After she repeated that she felt stupid, I said I would talk to her later because I felt like the conversation was not going anywhere but now I'm really feeling like I did the wrong thing and made things complicated for her with her family. AITA for not going along with her lying about my job to help her save face?Edit: I've been with her for 6 months. "
151,Not the A-hole,Wibta if I report my history teacher,68,m0ri8b,57,I’m a junior in high school and this is the year colleges look at the most so it’s really important to get good grades. My history teacher doesn’t assign much work but when he does he refuses to give instructions for the assignment in class. He expects us to come 5 minutes early (this class is right after lunch so it’s not interfering with our other classes) so we can get assignment instructions then he lectures for the entire class period. It’s so annoying to have to leave lunch early because this teacher won’t give us our instructions during class and if you’re busy or forget to leave lunch early there’s no way to get the instructions for these assignments.I was talking about reporting him to the office to my friends the other day and they all think I shouldn’t because teaching online has to be hard Wibta if I report him for this
152,Not the A-hole,Aita for completely isolating myself because I feel weak when crying ?,120,m0n94b,36,"Hi ,so this happened yesterday and I feel prettyguilty. ( I am an orphan)Me and my wife had let her brother host his sons birthday party at our home as it was bigger and I even baked them a cake. well everything is going smoothly and their are about 25 people (covid-19 cases are 0 in our area) but during the end my fiance's brothers girlfriend was tipsy and had been drinking  and stood up to make a toast. I didn't really know her well and everytime I tried to talk to her she would either ignore me or just straight up walk away even during the partySo she stood up talks about how much she loves her kid , appreciates my wife for letting her do this at HER home and the normal speech .at the end tho out of no where she makes a joke about how mediocre the cake was (it took me 4 hours ) and how she felt uncomfortable that a person whose parents had not wanted her was their and said she felt that I was a glowing symbol of how parents give up their kids cause they don't love them and she didn't want that type of person at her boys special day (he's 13 btw)I am not at all confrontational and literally just ran to the first floor and locked myself in a bedroom .I just cried and had a panic attack their and felt so embarrassed she said that infront of everyone.after like a bit when everyone left the house was empty with only my wife and my two step daughter cleaning up a bit.my wife did try to come down to comfort me but I prefer to be alone because I just hate people seeing me cry. I prefer to keep a distance.i just made fries and nuggets and sat staring at a wall when waiting. Everytime was just so weird and overwhelming . I didn't talk to anyone about it and just feel guilty that mabey I should talk about it to my wife but idk I feel weird and like a child when talking about my problems and it makes me feel weak ."
153,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to go on a family holiday with my BF’s family because I hate his 7 year old nephew?,3736,m03j1p,411,"So - context first - 2 years ago I went on holiday to Spain with my boyfriend and his sister, her husband, three nieces and his nephew (then 5) (SIL and BIL for this). We rented a shared house - they wanted to go to petting zoo’s etc where as me and my BF wanted to lie by the pool and drink so we agreed every other day we would do things together and then the other days we would spend time apart (just me and bf)  - same in the evenings, some nights together some apart. I should add they asked to come with us because they don’t earn a lot of money and it would be cheaper for them to share the cost of the house, food etc with us. We felt bad for them so agreed. I’d spent time with them before and it was fine in short stints and we already knew his nephew was.... loud. But oh my god. He was a nightmare... he screams CONSTANTLY. Every day 4am to 7pm - screaming not matter what mood he was in. He also constantly misbehaved - he hit his sisters, threw toys, threw food, drinks, etc. He went into my bag and pulled out my makeup and stuck his fingers in it. Also whenever I was wearing a bikini by the pool her would pull the strings so it came apart - the first time it happened I flashed my BIL. It got to the point I wouldn’t lie by the pool or swim if the kids were there. SIL&ampampampampBIL told him no but he kept on doing it. We had every other day to ourselves but whenever we were in the house with them it was just constant stress. Not what anyone wants from a holiday. We’ve booked the same place again for August (hopefully if restrictions are lifted - fully refundable if not) - we weren’t going to say to them we were going but my BF mentioned off hand and she text us a few days ago to ask if they could come again. BF said to them it’s been a tough year and we wanted some alone time together. She said we wouldn’t need to spend time going out together - we could just share the house. BIL lost his job this year etc and they really need this as a family break and her mum agreed to pay for them all to go (she actually agreed to give them £400 for a holiday of their choice but coming with us means they save money and can actually go away rather than camping or something in the UK). SIL said we would be like “Ships in the night” was the way she described what it would be like. That might be what they intend but even by BF’s mum has admitted that nephew is no better now than he was a few years ago... if anything he is worse now. My boyfriend said to her he would ask me, but he wasn’t sure it would work. Separately he then said to me he thinks we should say yes - mainly because we don’t really have a way of saying no now. He feels bad because it’s his sister and he knows they’re having a tough time - which I get but we deserve a holiday too. He’s not going to go behind my back and say yes - or blame it on me. But he does think we’re being a bit cruel saying no. If it were up to me I would just be upfront with them and say we don’t want to because if the way Nephew behaved last time and we want a relaxing holiday. But I understand from my BF’s perspective this isn’t something he feels he can say to his sister - I’ve said I would say it. But would this make me an asshole if I was honest about not wanting to go because of her son?*UPDATE* wooooahhh- thanks for all the comments guys. Wasn’t expecting so many :) I’ve added some comments and responses below that have more info.  But I will update as well :)*UPDATE 2* - a lot of people saying nephew sounds like he is on the spectrum, has ADD, etc. I agree but he has been tested and has come back negative for any sort of neurological issues. If it were me I would have him tested again and seek a second opinion but parents are adamant that this is a phase and he will grow out of it as apparently as well it’s an “at home” issue and at school he is fine. Although obviously we can only take their word for this. Also a lot of people saying it’s my responsibility to say something to them about getting him tested again? I have to say a hard no to that - I’m comfortable addressing his behaviour with them but I 100% do not think it’s my place to go to them and tell them I think he needs to tested for Autism, ADD, etc again. Especially as I’m not a doctor or an expert in this in any way, shaper or form. Also I have to respect that I am not blood related - at the moment I’m just the SIL’s, brothers, girlfriend. As for my BF, he is his uncle, not his father - he has made the suggestion in the past that he might have issues which is what lead to his parents testing him in the first place - but as I said, all was negative and as parents they have made the decision to leave it there. Same as me, BF is not comfortable making this suggestion again.*UPDATE 3* I’m at a loss as to why so many people are so angry at my boyfriend here... I’ve noticed a lot of posts were people just seem to be angry at men in general so I’m not sure if this is a theme? I’m going to spell this out again - but just to be clear. I’m not here to get your opinion on my BF - he’s not the issue here. 1) when SIL text my BF to ask if they could come he text her back saying HE did not think it was a good idea they came. 2) BF does not mind that much if they come as he would like to see his family. However did NOT say this to his sister as he knew this would make me look like the bad guy. He is going to respect my wishes and tell her WE do not think it will be a good idea if we come. 3) He said to SIL we would discuss this together and he would get my thoughts and then let her know. I AM GLAD HE DID THIS. I HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED MY BOYFRIEND HAVING AN OPEN CONVERSATION WITH ME ABOUT ANYTHING A *RED FLAG*4) I would rather we came to decisions together and present a united front on what could be a potentially contentious issue - I don’t think either of us should “take the blame” in this situation."
154,Not the A-hole,WIBTA If I don't go with my mum to put her cat down?,8,m12cjf,11,"I'm going to preface this with an explanation of my relationship with my mother - we are basically an inch from estranged. I had an extremely traumatic childhood at the hand of her parenting which only in my 30s am I starting to unravel how that impacted my behaviours and self-esteem. I try not to hold it against her as a single parent with a mental illness, but I can't just forgive and forget something that has literally shaped every relationship and job I've had since I was forcibly kicked out of home, by her, as a teenager.My mum's cat is 18 years old and deaf. He is a lovely cat but the past few months he's been harder and harder to look after as an elderly, deaf, indoor/outdoor cat in a second storey apartment with no cat flap and an owner with partial disability. Due to my mum's partial disability she lost her driver's license but claims it's an administrative error and she can physically drive a car safely - that's another story but it's related because, here's the situation:The house-call veterinarian attended after cat was ill and behaving unusually for 3 days. The cat had to be taken to the vet clinic for more tests and an ultrasound has found bowel cancer. Blood test results are pending but it seems likely cat will need to be put to sleep. My mum is very very upset and has no other family she talks to. Unfortunately the way I see it, I'm not really family she talks to either. I tolerate phone calls from her once a month and pay her an obligatory visit at Christmas, assuming she hasn't started an unnecessary argument with me in the lead-up (which happens often). My mum thinks the only option is for me to take my Thursday evening to drive 1 hour to her house and take her to the vet (not sure distance/time) so she can be wth the cat and bring him home and give her emotional support. I have my own chronic illness, and while I usually feel worse in the mornings but ok in the evenings, I still have a very restrictive diet and low bodyweight so taking a 3-4 hour trip on a Thursday night would likely be very disruptive and mean I miss a meal, sleep poorly and potential to trigger a flare-up of my illness which might just last 24 hours or it might last 2 weeks, I really don't know. I also feel like my resentment at having to be there against my wishes would bring another level of negative energy to that experience for her rather than the emotional support she seems to be craving..In terms of her being able to travel to the vet clinic herself, we have Ubers and taxis and not a single case of coronavirus in our city for 2 weeks.I feel a bit like I would be an asshole to not take her to the vet and be there while her cat gets put to sleep but I just am not healed enough from my upbringing with her to show her the empathy she needs. Would I be an asshole if I didn't go?"
155,Not the A-hole,AITA for being hesitant to meet the children of my mothers new husband?,714,m0b8lr,127,"My family situation is a little complicated. So we have myself (25F), my brother (27M), my mom (61F) and her new husband (70M). My mom divorced my dad when I was about 14, and then about 9 years ago, got in a relationship with her new husband (they got married last year). After 3 years or so of them dating, he moved in with us because my mom owns a house and he lived in a flat after he divorced his previous wife, with whom he has three kids. He has one son (25M, as old as me), and two daughters who are a bit older, the middle daughter is about 32 now (so 7 years older than me) and the oldest daughter is 34 (I think, not sure on this).So my mom and her new husband got together when I was about 16, he moved in when I was about 19 and lived on my own because of university. I never had anything against their relationship, I wanted my mom to be happy and he‘s a really nice person. During the 9 years of the relationship, his kids never wanted to meet us. Ever. They were invited to Christmas, my moms/her husbands birthdays, all the things. They never wanted contact, they didn‘t like my mom because they thought their dad cheated on their mom with her. The oldest daughter specifically had a lot of issues with the relationship. I always thought it was childish behaviour, I was 16 when they got together, and the daughters at least were significantly older (23 and 25 when they first started dating, 26 and 28 when he moved in etc.). My mom asked my brother and me last weekend if we were fine with meeting them sometime this year, since the oldest daughter finally started to accept the relationship. My brother was fine with it, and said so, but I was a bit hesitant and said that I needed to think about that a bit. This disappointed both my mom and her husband, and they didn‘t want to accept that as an answer. They said something along the lines of after nine years we should finally meet etc. I replied that it wasn‘t because of us that we didn‘t meet. Right from the beginning I really wouldn‘t have minded to meet them, they were/are part of my moms husbands life, he‘s part of her life, so by extending that I thought we should at least meet. I even asked a couple of times if we‘d meet them or if they‘d come over for christmas. My moms husband then replied that it‘s not about blame and nobody is at fault and that life isn‘t always logical. I said I wasn‘t sure if I‘d like to meet them (because why now, after 9 years? That‘s a really long time.), and they seemed unhappy with that answer. Am I the asshole for not being super excited and saying yes from the get go but needing time to think about this?"
156,Not the A-hole,AITA for making my mom pay college fees?,40,m0uoho,34,"Background: I’m a 17 yo female & my family is in rough ish times. Sorry for format I’m on mobile. My mom told me straight up in middle school that she would not fund any of my college. This year, knowing it’s application season, she agreed to pay for a few things, like application fees and AP class fees, as well as a few college level dual credit’s I’ve taken in high school. I was really happy about this because I knew that I’d done all the hard work of getting good grades and good act and sat scores. And I did get a full ride to my school of choice. However, today is the last day to pay fees for AP tests, which determine if I get college credit for my AP classes I’ve taken this year. My total adds up to about 400$. She said that she doesn’t want to pay them, and I told her politely that if she didn’t want to pay or couldn’t we could file for free and reduced lunches, which waives AP fees in my state. She insists I’m being crazy and should just pay the 400$ myself, and says it’d be embarrassing to do that. 400$ is almost a whole paycheck for me, and I really don’t want to pay for something that could easily be filed for. My dad is also taking her side and saying I’m the asshole, saying I should dip into my savings and pay for the fees. His main argument was that when they found out I got into college they took me to Golden Corral so they shouldn’t have to pay anymore. I’m considering filing for the free and reduced lunches without even telling her because she’s being so dramatic.So AITA for making my mom pay college fees?"
157,Not the A-hole,AITA for ignoring my friend’s emergency call?,73,m0pewo,33,"So the whole story started before New Years Eve. In the beginning of December she argued with her quite toxic boyfriend. We have been friends since we were 7 and till I got married we spent each of the New Years together. So to cheer her up and with my husband’s encouragement I booked for us a trip to a spa resort (and I really needed a break). Just me and her, just how we used to do it. My husband decided to bring the kids with him to his parents and it took quite a lot of organizing and planning. I also paid for the trip as I’m in a better life situation than my friend.One day before the trip she called me and told me that her ex’s mom came to her and begged her to join her son’s massive party (during coronavirus). She asked me to ditch the plans I paid for and go with her to the party. Then when I told her I don’t want to, she said she can’t just not go or it will be over with her ex.The thing with her on and off bf is that he is always breaking up with her. She always needs my support but never listens to my advice.So we talked for hours and she told me I left her first for New Year’s Eve (that is not completely true because I was always inviting her over - she just never came.)  I felt really bad and I knew making her go with me would ruin the trip. Instead of going to the spa I went to my husband’s family and although I love his family this situation just broke my heart and I couldn’t help crying.Two weeks later she called me just to complain about the guy. I got really mad and asked her to never speak to me about him again, but she tried to start this topic many times more. Week ago my husband and I needed to go for the weekend out of town for a funeral.  So I asked my friend to take care of my kids for a few hours till my in-laws can take over. She said “sure, no problem”. On the day of the funeral I couldn’t reach her. No one else could help me out so my husband went alone - again, broke my heart.She called me at night, crying and begging me to pick her up. I thought she was in danger, but as she explained she needed a vacation with her boyfriend and they argued. He locked her out of the room and she had no money and nowhere to go, it was really cold and she was scared, her phone was dying. So she wanted me to drive 2 h one way to pick her up. I just started screaming at her for not letting me know in advance she won’t take care of my kids and I hanged up.She spent a night on the street and apparently her bf let her back in the next morning. She said I stabbed her in the back. Some of our mutual friends stopped talking to me. (No one is mad at the guy because “you know how he is”)Our moms put pressure on me to apologize and make the first step. But I feel it’s not fair as it all wouldn’t happen if she helped me out in the first place. I just feel like she did me wrong so many times,  but she just depends on me and my money. Am I wrong in this situation? Should I apologize?"
158,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling things to my therapist that i don’t tell my mom?,89,m0nr1e,64,"sorry i can’t really word this situation well but i’ll try my best. Basically during the lockdown period i (15F) started going to therapy because i wasn’t doing well mentally. It really started to make me feel better because i cannot have conversations like that with my parents without them blowing up and telling me how spoilt i am and how i have no reason to feel like i do, so for this reason i do not tell them many personal things but i do try to maintain a good relationship with them. Today, my therapist asked if she could discuss things with my mom. The therapist suspected i had depression and anxiety, and was also doing non-clinical tests for autism. She told this to my mom (with my permission) and i could practically feel her stiffen up next to me. She yelled at me the whole car ride home calling me ungrateful and spoilt and said she was really hurt that i told things to my therapist that i didn’t tell her, like how my dog sadly passed away today and instead of crying to my mom about how much i missed him i discussed things with my therapist. It’s really made me feel like shit and both of my parents keep insisting it’s my fault and i wanted to hear an outer opinion. thanks."
159,Not the A-hole,AITA for not going to work,8,m1251q,43,So a few days ago I messed up and completely missed one of my shifts for my job and when I had realized it it was already too late. I saw that manager had texted me asking where I was so I immediately apologized and said it was a mistake and it wouldn't happen again as this was the first time this had ever happened. She was clearly very upset and wrote back saying that I was getting written up as this was unacceptable and that I won't be going to work this week as she got someone to take the rest of my shifts as punishment. I told her I understood and I apologized once again for the inconvenience and she notified me saying that this cannot happen again or else it will be dealt with repercussions far more serious than this.So I was guilt stricken and felt horrible about this whole ordeal so I scheduled things to do on the days I was initially supposed to be working so I could get my mind off of things. On one of those days I got a call from my manager asking me to come in and work because apparently the person she had arranged could no longer make it but I had already arranged plans because I didn't even imagine them calling me when they made it pretty clear that they didn't want to see me. I told them I couldn't go which probably strained my relationship with my manager even further since she now has to go find somebody else. I feel like I am the asshole because it was my shift originally and it is my fault for not showing up earlier that week so AITA for not going to work?
160,Not the A-hole,AITA for cancelling on a bachelorette party?,53,m0rbas,43,"My (28F) friend (28F) Alexis is getting married.  Alexis and I have been friends since childhood, we live several states apart now, but we're still very close, we FaceTime 2-3 times/week.  So I was really surprised that Alexis didn't make me a bridesmaid.  As she explains it, she felt bad, but her fiance didn't have another friend he could ask to be a groomsman, and as the ""long distance friend"" I was logistically the easiest to cut.  I felt hurt, but resolved to be pleasant and that no one outside my mom and cat would know my true feelings about it.  Alexis asked me to attend her bachelorette party, and I said yes.  Shortly after, her MOH added me to their bridesmaids group text so I could get details about the bachelorette night.  And - holy shit those girls can fight.  What restaurant we're going to, what color the T-shirts will be, blah blah blah it's an argument each time.  I've stayed out of it all because I'm Not A Bridesmaid and don't need to insert myself into those issues.  But it's also a constant reminder of the rejection I feel from being the friend on the chopping block.So after 3 weeks of this, I decided I don't need to put up with it anymore.  I decided I don't need to fly to a party with people I don't like in a situation that would make me feel bad.  So I canceled on them.  I said that work was getting hectic and I couldn't take the time off anymore.  Here's where the asshole part comes in potentially? The MOH has asked us to pay her for the rental house in 3 days, the party itself is in 2 weeks.  My cancellation makes the cost about $25 higher on everyone else.  They're saying I should pay for my share.  I disagree - my assigned room was supposed to be shared with someone else anyway, so she can push the twin beds together now, the 'deposit' is the request of the MOH and not the real AirBnB deadline, they have plenty of time to find a cheaper house with one less bed if they want.  I said all this but I'm still getting a lot of messages from them about how I need to pay up.  To my knowledge, Alexis is completely unaware and uninvolved with the bachelorette party costs.Money is tight for me - I'm a medical resident with a lot of debt - I don't want to pay for a party I'm not going to.  But I also want to keep the peace.  So Reddit, am I acting reasonably or AITA?"
161,Not the A-hole,AITA for referring to my food intolerance as an allergy?,1499,m06ze2,442,"I (28f) have a nightshade intolerance. In particular, potatoes/ potato starch make me incredibly sick to my stomach. People tend to not take me seriously if I say I have an intolerance. I get sick even if my food is touching fries or chips, yet sometimes waiters will ignore me and serve them anyways. For some reason people seem to think an intolerance is a diet choice rather than an actual medical issue. As a result, I’ve started referring to it as an allergy when I go out to eat. On Friday I was out to eat with some family friends and when I mentioned to the waiter that I had a potato allergy, one family friend interrupted and said, “oh it’s not an allergy, it’s not like she’ll die!” Luckily my mom was with us and immediately spoke up that while I might not die, I do get extremely sick, so it is important that I not be served anything with potato. Am I the asshole for technically being dishonest and saying I have an allergy so that people take my intolerance seriously?"
162,Not the A-hole,AITA for not making my daughter rehire the neighbor girl to her small business?,3188,m030m0,478,"My daughter (12) started a small business with birthday money she’d saved up. She hired a few kids from the neighborhood to work in her business once it started to grow. One of the neighborhood kids she hired wasn’t doing satisfactory work, so she ended up having to fire her. I stayed out of it. Not my place to micromanage. The mother of the child my daughter let go contacted me and said her child was feeling left out now that they couldn’t participate in the business and asked me to instruct my daughter to rehire them. I explained I’m really not involved in her business at all, so I didn’t feel right doing that. She said it’s all well and good to stand back to an extent but when it gets to the point that it’s exclusionary it’s my responsibility to step in as the parent, because now her child’s feelings had been hurt, and that’s more important than how lucrative my daughter’s business is or isn’t. I told her I couldn’t help. She was pretty flustered and said I could help but was choosing not to. It got to a point that I more or less had to ask her to leave my house. I see both sides, and worry I was harsh in what I said to her or should have given her concerns a longer hearing. But I don’t know what else I could have said (or not said) to her. AITA for refusing to intervene?Edit: typo"
163,Not the A-hole,AITA For getting mad at my mom because she told me that my art was horrible?,37,m0sia7,25,"Context: My mom was looking at my middle schools art show back in 6th grade. She saw the drawing i had put in there, and told me that she was ashamed that i would make it. I was super confused at first, and asked what was going on. She showed me the drawing that i had submitted, and glared at me for a while, which obviously made me kinda annoyed. The drawing was from back when i was testing out with different styles, and the drawing was a abstract one, where i used the lines of notebook paper to decorate. The notebook lines were drawn on, and there was a space where a anime girl was seen walking, with no lines. After that there was patterns and doodles, with little eyes that didn’t have lines too.My mom is the realism type of person, who doesn’t like abstract or fantasy type drawings. Now, my mom told me that this was unacceptable, and that she was ashamed i would even use notebook paper. I told her i didn’t, and she yelled at me for apparently lying. I told her i was only 11, and this was 3 years ago, and what do you think you’re gonna change by yelling at me? After that she yelled at me more, saying how i could be good at art, but i draw all this stupid “chinese cartoons” (anime style), and that i  this is part of the reason i can never be a artist or photographer (the two things i would wanna do). I got mad and told her that i would never even want to be a lawyer or doctor like she says, and that i would hate it working as one. We yelled for a while, and now i feel humiliated and angry, and my mom is just going on about how shes gonna have a heart attack because I’m apparently so bad  and disrespectful. Am I the Asshole?"
164,Not the A-hole,WIBTA If I didn’t use my sister’s wedding planning business for my own wedding?,102,m0lhnd,34,"My sister quit her job as an event coordinator with a hotel a couple years ago so that she could pursue running her own small business specializing in wedding, party, and event planning. The business consists of her doing all of the planning, then the day of the event pulling in my mom, dad, maybe myself, and maybe my now fiancée to boss around and do all the physical work for free. I don’t like this at all, but I usually help because family.I recently got engaged, and my fiancée and I have been laboring over the issue of “how do we handle this situation with her”. I’m very much on the camp of “it’s our day and about us, so we tell her no and frame it as we want her to enjoy the event and not have to be working” but my fiancée thinks it won’t be that simple.On my sister’s business Instagram page, she would post things like “Did you get engaged recently...[more post text]. I actually know someone who did, and I’d be willing to give them a family discount )” or using our engagement picture to post and saying “Congratulations!....[post text], I also know a great wedding planner/florist/wedding decorator that would be able to help you out )”We’re also somewhat worried, as we’re planning an engagement party out of state with some extended family. While planning it I asked my parents “Is this just going to be a dinner and everyone hangs out affair, or is it going to be a whole decorations kind of ordeal” to which she responded “You don’t think your sister hasn’t thought of that already?” I’m willing to ride this party out and see how it goes, but I am worried it won’t end too well. Usually, a sister planned event devolves into her and my mom arguing about things at the event and everyone “working” in a bad mood. I don’t like her style at all as it is very HGTV and repurposed things (think painted wine bottles as centerpieces). On top of this, my fiancée helped my sister run a wedding (sister was day-of-coordinator, fiancée just helped with whatever she needed), and she told me it was close to a shit show—the bride was flustered the whole time, things were a bit disorganized, sister wasn’t very assertive or in charge etc.Context out of the way, would I (we) be the asshole if we didn’t utilize her for the event? I really don’t want to pay her for what I know will be 1. More stress 2. Nothing extra added, and 3. An excuse to become free advertising and plastered all over the business Instagram"
165,Not the A-hole,AITA For Calling My Mom An Ass?,71,m0npob,26,"Background: I (23f) started dating my bf (25m) about 1.5 years ago. However, because of you know what, my bf and my family have had limited contact due us living in the west coast and them living in the midwest. Recently, my mom (64f) got the vaccine so she came to visit me and requested she meet my boyfriend by going out to dinner at a restaurant she liked. I am Chinese-American and my parents are naturalized citizens coming from a very conservative area.We kind of started on the wrong foot: my bf showed up 5 minutes late. He parked in the wrong place and had to walk a couple blocks. Not a big deal to me, but my mom said that it was completely unacceptable. ""girls should never have to wait for a man"". When he arrived my mom made passive aggressive comments towards him about how people who are late are purposely disrespectful and how she never has to wait for her husband. He apologized to her and we walked inside.Throughout the entire dinner, my mom would not engage in conversation with him. Every time he said anything to prompt conversation she would say ""No, No you have no idea, you've never experienced X"" or something to that degree about how hard her life was. He did handle it like a champ and tried to empathize with her. I would even try to diffuse the situation by switching to topics she liked like k-dramas, the west coast weather, the food we were being served, etc. But nothing seemed to work and she wouldn't engage at all. Even talking about my dog, who she really loves when she sees him in person, she would just talk about how much he pooped and peed and how sharp his teeth were. Then,  she got really drunk, and started talking about politics. I won't go into it too much, but she made some extremely racist comments. I had no idea what to say, but my bf just said to treat people we want to be treated and mentioned my parents were ""new here too at one point"" alluding to their immigrant status.When he went to the bathroom, my mom told me that he was acting like a ""smart aleck"" and that he was rude for calling them ""aliens"" (he did no such thing). I couldn't handle it anymore so I told her ""He's just trying to keep the conversation light. Not everyone has to kiss your ass when you're acting like one.""That really set her off and she was so upset she left the dinner early and sat in her car.  My bf and I agreed it was a hard night, but he's not really asking for an apology. After me and my bf finished eating (it really was a lovely dinner after she left) I went to the car she was in. She says my boyfriend is bad and disrespectful, but the real reason she left was because I called her an ass which showed I wasn't on her side. This is where I think I was wrong. I still think my mom is an ass, but I could have said it differently. On the other hand, she was being relentless in being an ass and part of me feels like she really deserved it. I'm not sure. AITA? ESH?"
166,Not the A-hole,AITA for opening card packs without asking?,17,m0xjyd,26,"So, yesterday my(23M) dad(46M) had gotten some magic cards in that he had ordered. He ordered a box of 36 packs of Ikoria. While he has only just gotten back into Magic after about 15 or so years and I for the first time, he and I have played Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh! as well. It's always been a think since I was a child and still now as well that regardless of whether it were him or if it were I got a bunch of card packs, we would set it on the table and just open the packs, no asking needed. We've done this for years and were totally cool and fine with it. We have a friend(40M) that we play other games with that found out we got into Magic and he was excited because he has a ton of cards and loves to play. Yesterday, he was staying over(he'd been there for a couple days to help my cousin move into where I live) and my dad had gotten a 36 pack box of Ikoria in and set it on the table and pulled the packs out of the box and set us some each to open. After opening the 3 he'd set to us, I reached over and started to open some more without asking since we've always done just that for years and when the friend had noticed he got pissed off. He started saying about that being rude and how I should always ask no matter what and when I tried to tell him about what my dad and I do, he said he didn't care and said it's still rude. I tried to argue that it isn't rude because we have had it established that it's fine to just take that pack and open it without even needing to ask. He refused to listen and said that it doesn't matter and that it will always be rude no matter what. I blew up and it became a yelling match with him saying that he's ""just trying to help me be a decent person"" by making me ask instead of just me doing so without asking. Eventually we just started ignoring each other and after finishing the opening of them and sorting them by color, rarity and land, I left and went to my room."
167,Not the A-hole,Aita for trying to teach my bf to take responsibility??,25,m0v0yl,47,"For context: I’ve been sick (bronchitis) for the past couple days while staying at my boyfriends house. We are both 18 So to keep it short, my boyfriend and I both have a pair of airpods. He’s hopeless at charging his and knowing where they are, so he lost them. Everytime this happens he asks to use mine, and no matter how much I need them I always let him take them. This morning as he was getting ready for school he asked to use mine and I said no and I told him he needed to learn how to take responsibility and deal with the consequences of being irresponsible. He kept asking and I told him I wasn’t letting him take mine. As he got ready I looked for his and couldn’t find them anywhere, and he left soon after. About a minute after he left I found them in a bag and they weren’t flat so I ran down the road despite being dizzy/lightheaded and having shortness of breath, and tried to give them to him before he got on the bus. I couldn’t see him so I called and was like “hey come back I’ve found them” and he said he was too far away (he couldn’t have been that far) and that it was alright because he had taken mine anyway. I got really mad about this and messaged him and told him I was upset that he disrespected what I had said and I called him unbelievable, and he replied with this “Bruh why couldn’t you just share them I was helping you all day yesterday and you can’t even share your airpods one time. Why can’t you just use mine?” To which I responded with,“Yeah okay I could’ve given them to you but how are you supposed to learn to take care of your own things if you never have to deal with the consequences? I’m not always going to be there to take care of those things for you, or clean your room, or charge your laptop. You need to learn how to do it yourself and you’re never going to if I’m constantly doing stuff for you. I ran down the road to try and give you your airpods because I helped you look for them, I got back and cried because my head started pounding and I couldn’t breathe, I do all this stuff for you and what do I ever get in return? I know you helped me all day yesterday and I really appreciated it but I do so much for you and what do I get in return? You disregarding what I’ve said and stealing my stuff despite me saying no?” I think I might be the asshole because he did help me yesterday and get me medicine etc, and I definitely could’ve let him use them. But I think I’m not the asshole because while I could’ve just said yes, I don’t think he’s ever going to learn if I’m always saying yes instead of letting him deal with the consequences. Plus, he only helped me yesterday because I was sick, other than that he NEVER goes out of his way to do stuff for me. For example, if I ask him to get something out of my bag while my hands are full, he will sit there until I’ve asked about a million times, and he’ll only do it once I get annoyed and move to just do it myself. So, AITA??"
168,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling a classmate no,11,m10elp,14,"For context I am in Nursing school. Before we can go into the hospital we are put under a simulation exam to see if we are ready for the hospital. I failed 2 times last year so this year I had to go back to get tested again as well as take the class again. I had a classmate who was from the original class that I was in. At first everything was good and we agreed to help eachother out when it was time for the simulation exam. I found out a few weeks back that she had to drop out on the original class because she cheated. As precaution because I didn't know if this was true or not I had to distance myself. I recently told her that I will no longer be helping because I thought it would be unfair for every body to if I share what I know of the simulation exams to her. At the same time she was rude to my bestfriend a lot. Allthough I talked about it and voiced that I will no longer practice and to leave me alone as I am not comfortable practicing with her anymore. I am not sure she understand what I was trying to say. She apologized but kept trying to convince me to practice with her. She tried to bargain with me by saying we should practice to just to explain things to her and that I can keep track of her progress when I am also a student. I said no 7 times both in text and in person. I thought this was all over but the other day I caught her going through my things without permission. She was specifically going through what I had written down for the lab simulation. I got mad and took my things. She resorted to crying, apologizing and asking for permission to look at my things.I know she is trying to get through to me by using her emotions. She even tried to convince me by saying I had helped her last semester. This was during lunch so I moved away from where I was eating she proceeded to harass me by following me around and convincing me to help her. She also blamed me for not being helped by the other girls even to which I denied because I would love it if the other girls will help her because then she would get off my ass. When I reached my point I threatened to go to the Head of the department and instructor if she doesn't stop. She didn't and infact she added trying to beg me to not come to them. And she harassed me more trying to talk. And during this I saw the head of the department on the hallway and made her aware of what is going on she agreed to not take action as there wasn't any evidence. This classmate then proceeded to talk to her after accusing me of turning the whole class against her which to me is her last resort to try and force me to work with her. She also thought I spread rumours about her when I don't even know the other girls in class personally and I don't mingle with them because I am an introvert and like my alone time. And to add this is not the first time she has done this and to her knowledge she didn't know I had already gone to the instructor and head of the department for her behaviour."
169,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling myself infertile when we're choosing to use a surrogate?,1454,m05qxl,183,"My husband and I met in college, and early on, I learned that he had beaten cancer as a teenager and was sterile, but had banked a small amount of sperm. I didn't think about it at the time, and we eventually married and started talking about how to start a family.I've always had ""female health problems"" because my anatomy isn't exactly what it should be and I have hormonal issues that ""signify PCOS"". The doctors have told me that due to these things, I have a 50% chance of miscarriage regardless of any other factors. I can do IVF, have an absolutely perfect embryo and have every environmental factor be perfect, and it is still a random coin toss.When your sole option is a small amount of banked sperm, a 50/50 chance at best is a lot more terrifying. Even if I had ideal fertility, IVF would be the first option for conception due to the odds. The genetic testing that would have to be done decreases the amount of embryos even further than normal. Due to the combination of everything and the costs involved, we've decided to work with a surrogate first, and then once we've had two children, consider rolling the dice on me if we want a third. His cousin is done having kids, and has agreed to try for at least the first kid, which we're grateful to her for and are looking forward to starting on soon.Because he's been public about the cancer, he also has no problem being public about doing surrogacy. In the announcement post, the reason is written as post-cancer infertility and outs us as an infertile couple.My family has seen this, and they are furious that we are calling ourselves infertile and using a surrogate first. They say that we've never even tried, that I am not infertile, and that my ""pretending"" is insulting to ""actually infertile"" women. While it is true that that I've never done like tracking or anything, I think that my problems plus limited sperm is at least a kind of infertility, and I don't think it's weird to use a surrogate because of it. They are still...not happy and have been ranting in the comments about it and it's starting a lot of drama. AITA?Because of this"
170,Not the A-hole,AITA i said no to my bf’s friend staying the night with us,33,m0shi5,28,"so my boyfriend  was supposed to go hangout with his friend, but he ended up not being able to get a ride, so a few hours later he asks if it would be okay if his friend stayed the night ( we’re both 19 and he moved in with me about a year ago. ) I have nothing wrong with his friend, but it was completely last minute, so I said no. he got really pissed off and said it was my fault I couldn’t drive him to begin with because I haven’t gotten tags for my car yet but he doesn’t even have a car or a drivers license. I have a few other reasons why I don’t really want his friend to stay the night 1.) everytime I hang out with my bf and his friend my bf makes me the butt of the joke and I’ve told him I dont like how it makes me feel2.) one time when we were all hanging out my boyfriend and his friend were going to the store so I asked if it was cool to tag along ( I’m the only one who can drive so I offered to drive them ) They both said it was fine, but when we were actually going my bf was in a bad mood the whole time and being super cold towards me and made me feel like shit the WHOLE time and overall made us all feel awkward. I asked him to stop treating me like I was a dog and he said “ you sure weaseled your way into coming with us like one “ even though he said before leaving it was fine that I come, and I haven’t really wanted his friend to come over ever since cuz it’s always like that when his friend is over. am I the asshole for saying no to his friend ?"

My dad and I both have the same microphone and one day I came into my room and my cable was gone.

He came into my room and asked if I took it and I said I took my cable back. He got frustrated and took it back. For reference my dad has work and I have school and I acknowledge he probably needs the cable more than me. It is important to mention that a couple of months ago we had the exact same issue, and he said that he would get one himself. AITA?"
172,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my therapist that my roommate’s behaviour was scaring me which had her move out?,887,m07imv,146,"Background on my roommate and my relationship: We’re civil to each other, not besties, not enemies. We don’t meddle in each other’s lives and mind our own damn businesses. The Incident: A couple of mornings ago, my roommate, like usual, jumped out of bed and sat at her desk. I was logged into one of my online classes and in the middle of it somewhere I noticed sudden movement in the room so I looked up to see her twitch her head aggressively. I waited for a couple of seconds to see if something seemed wrong, and when it didn’t I went back to hearing the lecture. By the end of that class, the twitch turned into a full jerk and got even more aggressive, so I shot her a text to ask if she’s okay but got no response. I went outside and when I came back the jerking had gotten worse, she was doing it more often and aggressively. And there were further developments, she was now giggling, scratching angrily, hitting the furniture with her fists. It was concerning, so I was going to ask her if she’s okay in person this time. When I turned to talk to her I saw her recording herself while she was jerking her head and giggling and that right there made me feel extremely uncomfortable and scared. I somehow still managed to ask her if she’s okay but she didn’t respond, it all got too creepy for me so I picked up my bag and was about to leave. Before I could get out she got off her chair and ran out the door, slamming the door so hard a friend of mine 2 floors down heard it. I left the room and I didn’t want to come back there for the rest of the day I planned to only go back in there to sleep. When I went to my zoom therapy session, my therapist noticed I was not in my room and that I looked upset, so she asked me what was going on and I blurted out the whole thing. She asked if I felt safe going back in there and I replied that I didn’t. She convinced me to tell someone about this and even offered to make the call on my behalf. She told the authorities everything that went down that morning and they got in touch with my roommate. I was sitting in the common room on my floor and attending my classes and meetings from there. I got a call in the evening telling me that they spoke to my roommate and she was moving out. Sure, I saw her carrying her stuff out and she even stopped to glare at me - gave me the absolute chills. Now she’s moved out, and we are both told to not contact each other at all. I felt a little guilty about it and our mutual friends are all texting me and calling me the jerk who had her move out and be on academic probation. (I didn’t know the academic probation bit). They are saying it’s all my fault and because of me, her life is ruined.  I didn’t think it was my fault, but after hearing from our friends I feel like I made this a big deal. AITA?  TLDR: My roommate’s behaviour was scaring me and I told my therapist about it who convinced me to alert the authorities. Authorities had her move out and put her on academic probation.Edit: Thank you everyone for chiming in and giving in your input, I really appreciate it. I mostly got responses telling that my actions were justified and I feel better about the situation now. Thanks y’all for the hugs and support!"
173,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my bf to spay his future dog and encouraging him to not breed her?,494,m0agwy,199,"My boyfriend and I have been arguing about this for over 3 hours now. He wants to get a purebred golden retriever in a couple of years and wants her to have puppies because he thinks it's ""very profitable"" and because he ""loves puppies."" He's trying to guilt me into supporting him by saying things like ""having puppies is awesome and if you can't see the beauty in that then you're blind"" and ""a real wife would want puppies too and want to raise them together."" He tries defending it by saying that ""there seems to be no downside to this"" and he also said very ignorant comments like ""do you think having puppies isn't cool like yeah you're blind I guess."" I told him about the health risks caused by not spaying your dog and the risks of breeding your dog with no experience and he just doesn't listen responding to me with ""it's not risking the dog's health, that's what they do"", ""there's no real huge risk"" (referring to giving birth and having puppies). I also told him that it can be very costly if you include vet bills, vaccinations, food, medical expenses, etc. but he doesn't believe me. He thinks it's not irresponsible if a dog has puppies  He also thinks I'm being negative/pessimistic, told me to grow up and ""learn how to think positive."" I even sent him numerous articles about breeding complications and the cons of breeding and he said ""that's the dumbest article I've ever read."" He even had the audacity to say that I don't understand anything about breeding and that he knows more about this than me despite the fact that I doubt he even researched anything about this. There's no getting through to him and I think he's gonna make an irresponsible, time-consuming, and costly mistake in the future. Our disagreement is causing conflict in our relationship.I'm trying to change his mind but he's so stubborn. AITA?"
174,Not the A-hole,AITA for siding with my parents against my older brother?,15,m0wpsi,18,"Ok so basically things between my parents and my brother have been tense for a while, and lately things have been escalating a bit.      My brother is an undergrad in college right now and he lives with us, and he’s never really been the hard worker or cared about his future(which already goes strongly against the principles in my family). So he spends his days working part time, and for the rest of the time sleeping in late, gaming all day/night, or going out. His grades were always pretty crap because he never puts in the effort to study so his tuition is quite expensive, so my parents pay like most of it for him and he also has loans. My parents got him a pretty nice car to use for commuting to his job, and my parents pay for most of the insurance. He’s not really taking care of the car, like he does zero maintenance for it, and he’s a pretty reckless driver(also infuriates my dad in particular. My parents just told him to save up and pay for his tuition next semester, but he hasn’t been doing that. He’s also been spending all of his money on subscriptions, pc parts, and basically just living the it life by buying whatever he wants. A month ago, he bought another super expensive pc part, and after some heated discussion with my parents, he got off the hook. Just last week though, he bought yet another part that was suuuper expensive to replace the part that he literally just got a month back. He has a habit of lying to my parents and me about all of these things because he knows that they’ll get mad at him, so he lied again about it but his lies were so ridiculous that it just made my parents even more livid. My mom has constant talks about how he needs to stop doing things for the pleasure in the moment, and start realizing that if he doesn’t work hard now, he’s going to suffer later, but it’s all pretty much useless words to his ear. Like, my mom literally has these talks with him in a patient manner, she’s not being demeaning in any manner.     So basically, my parents are really upset about what he’s doing and my dad literally wants to kick my brother out because he’s convinced that it’s the only way he’ll he understand his current privilege and change his bad habits. Their anger at him is a cumulation of him not spending any effort into his future, wasting his money, constantly lying to them, not doing any housework, and constantly gaming or sleeping. I’m split about this, because I just don’t know if it’s right to kick my brother out?   I’m just super distressed about all of it too even though it’s not even directly related to me. I stand with my parents on this issue and to be honest, I completely disapprove of my brother’s character. But like I just also feel so bad because I’m constantly being compared to him as the model child and I don’t deserve it at all because I’m not nearly as good as they think I am, and I’m just far from reaching their expectations of me or even what expectations I have for myself. So just, am I being an asshole for having these feelings towards my brother?"
175,Not the A-hole,AITA for not going to my graduation ceremony?,19,m0ur1b,28,"I (22M) am graduating this May with my masters in engineering. I’m pretty proud of this, and am really proud of what i’ve created/worked on both in terms of academics and my research while here. All that being said I don’t really care too much about the upcoming commencement. I went to my sisters two graduations and found them both quite boring. It wasn’t about me though and i went and supported her and was all around excited at her achievement (an absolute brainiac love her).To the issue at hand, I’ve applied to graduate, but since January i’ve more or less ignored the application to attend commencement, and it has since closed completely. Reason #1 to not go, is that i don’t care about the ceremony. It’s all a big show for me and i really won’t get anything out of the process. Reason #2 is that while many people will be vaccinated by May, i’m still not super comfortable with the idea of an indoor stadium full of people hanging about together. My family (particularly my mother) and my girlfriend are upset with me on this fact. My girlfriend (21F) is also graduating with her Masters (on a different day so we would not walk together) and i’m going to support her regardless of what she chooses.With that thought in mind, i’m kind of expecting the same support for something that doesn’t concern her. The same thought process goes for my family.Initially i was quite certain that i’m NTA but reading through some similar posts from past years i’m not so sure. I hadn’t thought of all the support my peers had provided me in little and large ways (rides, meals, favors, helping me move, etc etc) and i’m starting to think this isn’t just about me. I’m a little confused and unsure whether I’m in the wrong here and should try to attend commencement still.Your thoughts appreciated.Edit: to be clear, no one has explicitly called me TA. that being said their rebukes have implied as much."
176,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to help my dad at his store while my mom is away?,29,m0rxy6,29,"I 25F, live with my family. Not to get into details but no I am not a freeloader. I help with bills, rent, food, chores, etc. Since covid started I have been working from home 3 days a week, and go into the office on Mondays and Fridays. About 3 weeks ago my mother went to visit my ill grandmother and is going to stay with her for a month and a half. Now it's me, my dad, and my brother (M13) There is no such thing as equality in my house, when my mom is gone I have to do all the cooking, cleaning, chores, and my own office work/freelance projects on top of that. Now when my mom is here she helps my dad at his store about 2-3 hours each morning, my dad likes to ask her to come even when there isn't really any work. Since my mom left, my dad has been expecting me to come in everyday the same way she did, at first he said it was just for a week because he had a lot of work errands and needed someone to mind the store. It was inconvenient because mornings are when I do most of my work from home and communicate with my boss but I didn't complain and helped him out. Now it's been 2 weeks and he expects me to come in everyday.It's affecting my work as I fail to meet deadlines for my office work and for my freelance clients. I try to make up by working at night but between cooking, cleaning, chores etc I get exhausted and can hardly focus. Today he told me again at dinner he needs me to come in tomorrow because it's a big inconvenience for him not having anyone there in case he gets urgent errands in the morning. I told him I have a lot of work piled up and I won't be able to come in anymore because it's affecting my work and deadlines. My dad got super mad, called me ungrateful and said that I have a ton of attitude and think I am better than him. He shouted at me and told me I don't understand anything and I have to come in anyway because my small mind won't comprehend how important it is to have me there in case he gets work and that I should just shut up and do as he says.I have been crying for the past hour, I am so stressed and tired. I have been trying to do everything but I feel so overwhelmed. Is my dad right AITA? I really don't understand."
177,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling my friend out in a group chat?,30,m0sst4,25,"I have this friend, let's call her L. We never really talk unless we're in a group of people, so we're not that close. I would say we're casual friends we get along fine in a group, but it's a bit awkward when we're alone.But she's always made me a bit uncomfortable. L always called me things like ""stupid"" and ""dumb"" and ""loser""- which I'm USUALLY fine with, when I can tell it's a joke. But she says out of nowhere, like ""(my name) is such a loser"" or in a group chat, she would say ""oh my god why are you so DUMB."" Thing like that. I know it's not that big of a deal, but it's always got on my nerves a bit.She only does it to me, too. She shows affection and kindness to everyone else, but she always acts like that towards me. If she did it to everyone else, I wouldn't mind as much. But I feel singled out sometimes, and end up getting paranoid that I did something to piss her off.So a few days ago, when she did it again, (this was in the group chat btw) I messaged, ""Actually it hurts my feelings a bit when you do that- can you stop?"" and she responded, ""It's just a joke."" Then I said, ""It doesn't feel like a joke to me, even if it's unintentional it kind of hurts so could you just not do it?"" And she started listing reasons why she did it- because we were close enough to make those kinds of jokes, because we're good friends, and friends usually make those jokes with each other. Almost as if she were trying to justify what she said.Then I said ""but you don't make those jokes with our other friends"" And L just stopped responding completely. So I thought, huh, okay. I went to sleep. The next morning, I get this huge block from another friend, let's call her C, telling me that L went to her freaking out about how I ""made her look bad in the group chat"" and that she was really pissed that I made her look bad in front of the other people in the group chat and basically humiliated her.Then C got annoyed with me and said I should've just messaged her privately, and that I'm in the wrong here. Maybe I should've messaged her privately, in hindsight, but I guess I'm just not too comfortable with her so I did it in the group chat where I felt a bit safer. So C said I should apologize so I messaged L, saying sorry for calling her out and making her look bad. She's ignoring it, I know she saw it because she told people she's just not responding to it. And now everyone is ignoring me :/AITA? I guess I am... I really should've messaged her privately or at least talked to her. I guess I'm just upset that the only thing she cared about was how she looked and not about how my feelings were hurt."
178,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to dog sit?,19,m0wb3g,26,"My 21 y/o still lives at home but works on the road during the week. I also have a 9 y/o and 7 y/o, plus 2 other dogs and 5 cats. He wanted a puppy. He was told not to get it because he’s gone all the time (not really responsible in some ways either). He got it anyway, now expects me to watch it when he’s gone, which is all the time. AITA for refusing? Hubby is gone most of the time too, so it’s just me running this zoo."
179,Not the A-hole,AITA for baiting my roommate's dog back into the house when she escapes on my watch?,58,m0mkph,57,"I've been living here for two years.  Roommate has an unruly dog.  Dog likes to escape, eat food off tables, pee on furniture, attack other dogs, etc.  It used to be a lesser issue, because roommate had a work from home job so she was here to watch Dog at all times.  Unlike half the population during COVID, roommate has gone from working from home to working outside the house in the last few months (tldr, her employer laid off a ton of people and changed her job scope), which leaves me here with Dog.I'm not a huge fan of dogs, have no intention of owning one, and didn't grow up with one, so this is a less than ideal situation.  Dog's not a huge fan of me either, but we've gotten to the point where I can go take a shower or do some things in my room without Dog pissing all over the carpet or eating a throw pillow.  Roommate has more or less begged me to not move out though,  so here we are and it's more or less a middle ground for the moment.  She ""compromised"" with me by scheduling sessions with a dog trainer, which IMO is not helping too much.Dog still escapes the yard.  We have a six foot fence with a zap fence strung underneath, I always go outside with her, and it still happens (literally right in front of my face).  Generally she wants to murder either the neighbor's terrier or the other neighbor's chickens, and I'm not a huge fan of letting that happen, so I grab dog treats and bait her back into the house when this happens. Roommate is pretty pissed at me for doing this.  The dog trainer has tried to impress that this is a huge no, because it provides a positive reinforcement for bad behavior, but honestly... this is not my animal.  I'm not fast enough to catch her, and she doesn't listen to me if I call her.  I'm going to do everything in my power to not be legally liable for the death of someone else's pet.  Given that my preferred option is move and not deal with Dog again, I don't feel like I'm in the wrong."
180,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my son what I overheard his girlfriend saying to her friends about him?,135,m0gcre,39,"So this happened today and I'm still not sure if I am TA or not. My son is 17m and is dating a 16f. I went to pick up my kids from their places of work in town  and thought I would do a bit of shopping at the same time.                    I was standing perusing the chocolates when his girlfriend and two of her friends came around the corner and stood about 10 metres away from me. I think she recognised me but I am not hundred percent sure, one of her friends who knows me very well (she is my (15m) son's very good friend) she recognised me and gave me a little wave.              I didn't mean to be nosey but it was a loud rambuctious teen convo and I heard everything, that the three friends' plans went out the window and my sons girlfriend was due to be stuck in town for the next few hours (rural Australian town) I thought to myself ***I should offer her a lift home, it's out of the way but she is dating my son.***              But then I heard it.                  The girl I know well says ""how about you hang out with your boyfriend ?(she actually said my sons name but for privacy ""your boyfriend"" will suffice).Her response was "" Eww No"". (Her tone was disgust it didn't sound like a joke to me)                    I quickly walked away and found my two other kids (18f, 15m) and told them what happened. I asked them if this was ""normal?"" My daughter got flustered and my son said ""I knew something wasn't right"" I said bye to my (15m )son and jumped in the car with my( 18f )daughter and drove to pick up my (17m)son, the son whose girlfriend I just overheard.            I was quiet, I was still trying to figure out if I should say anything or let it go. He picked up and started texting my daughter, asking her what was wrong with me, she decided to not tell him what I overheard until she spoke with me, and chose to say I was probably annoyed his girlfriend didn't say hi.                  My daughter showed me the insane amount of texts afterwards calling me insecure, a b@tch, that I was just trying to ""start sh!t"" and that trust him to get into trouble for something as minor as his girlfriend not saying hi.              Obviously both myself and my daughter were taken aback (at this point I was waiting in the cafe to pick up dinner, he had chosen to stay in the car) my daughter went out to the car to tell him what I overheard.                    So supposedly she says it all the time to his face, it's a joke and I'm a nosey b!tch who should mind her own business.                Since we got home he hasn't said anything to me, started several fights with his sister and ignored everyone in the house.            Im honestly pretty hurt, I have a great relationship with three of my four kids, I've been trying so hard to help my 17 year old, to get back to the relationship we once had but its hard to know if I am being an Asshole or not these days?                              So AITA?                                      Extra Info: My family is very close, we try to keep communication open especially between siblings as we believe it allows them to have each other's backs. Sadly my 17year old son went through a pretty messy break up months ago now and it was the fact we communicate with each other that stopped the ex from imploding the family (She was starting drama for the sake of it - its a long story but short version is, we took her in, fed her, clothed her, made sure she was safe, she tried to drive a wedge between my daughter and me - all the while telling people in town we weren't feeding her or letting her have showers, it was crazy. We found out later she was known for doing this manipulative stuff but the damage had been done.) My son and I had a great relationship until a year back when I had a mental break. I said mean things about him in a delusional state that hurt him, I've apologised many times, I've gone to therapy and tried to better myself but I suppose its one of the reasons why I kinda let him get away with the name calling. I know he is still hurting and I've given him the ability to go to therapy himself but he chooses not to (which is his right - you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink)"
181,Not the A-hole,"AITA for ""choosing my nephew over my brother""?",21,m0u27b,34,"On mobile, sorry for formatting, I'm autistic and trying to make it neat.Tldr - I still see my nephew even though my brother and family don't, and don't want me to either. My brother, John has extremely severe ADHD, Depression, Anxiety, Paranoia, BPD amongst other things, though he's almost 30, his (self-described) mental age has been around 15 for many years. Our mother does everything for him, he lives on benefits in a flat that usually would be supported living but refused the support. John had a girlfriend (19 at the time) and they decided a baby would be 'cool' and she'd get social housing then. They were on and off, then she found out she was pregnant and though she promised she'd let him sign the bc, she went and registered baby without him as he wouldn't get back with her again.Since then she's either withheld contact or forced John, our mother or me to have the child (now 5) for weeks / months at a time by simply dissappearing.John and our mother fell out with her over it, had a massive argument and she completely cut contact, neither side willing to apologise about crap stuff they both said, it's completely petty and the child is missing out.John has decided *he has no child now* and that the kid will ""realise when he's older"". The mother / ex started dropping the child on me even more, making me miss work for weeks or months, including times with no car seat, many times in just a nappy/vest, clothes too small, filthy and unwashed or without any shoes or socks in winter. I could go on. Before anyone says, yes we've all reported her to social services but her mum works there and *assures them* that the 'allegations' are false. Knowing how he gets treated, I of course feel I can't ever say no, to the point I'm disabled now and put my own health at risk for him because he's a child, he's family and he can't protect himself. Now my family is yelling at me, saying I'm 'choosing him over John' when I'm just trying to protect my nephew. If they'd just ignore her petty outbursts, everyone would see the child and he'd be well cared for. As my husband puts it, at least he's getting fed and clothed and washed every time we see him.John is refusing to talk to me and won't entertain he idea of bringing the child to him so he still gets to be a dad, point blank refusing to talk about him.Mother is protecting 'her baby' (John) by allowing John to live in a delusion where his son doesn't exist and she repeatedly says ""he's not your child"" which, duh I know that! I may have raised him for weeks and months at a time but regardless I'm his auntie always and I've got my own kids. She also says ""it should be John's choice who gets to see him, if anyone."" and says I'm wrong for going against his wishes. So, AITA for ""choosing my nephew over my brother""?"
182,Not the A-hole,AITA - My dad told me to go to hell because i didnt serve him food and my mom yelled at me over it.,164,m0entz,95,"My father called me to give him food but i was in the middle of a game and the round was almost over. I asked him to wait for two minutes. He started sending my little brother to yell at me. And i could hear him talking to my mom saying i was wasting my time on my phone and i couldnt get up to give him foodI finished the round and got up. I was quite pissed that he couldnt wait for two minutes. When i came to the kitchen my mom said me to just go back and that they can do it themselves. It was clear that she expected me to apologize and serve him the food that was already made. I said fine and went back into my room.My dad swore and said go to hell and that kids like me are useless. I continued playing on my phone and my dad got up and got the food himself. My mother came into my room a while later and started yelling at me. I was super annoyed and ignored her and continued playing. Unfortunetly i couldnt block out her words. Most was the usual bullshit but these lines made me freeze over. She saod it in our native langiage but translated they mean, "" you really think you are doing us a favour just by being alive?"" "" all you do is stay in bed all day on your phone, you are trying to kill yourself.""What sucks is that less than a week ago i finally opened up to her about my depression and 'those' moments when i finally had enough. I ignored her and just stared at my phone until she left. AITA for ignoring and not listening to them or was it not my fault?"
183,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my mom we’re not close,18,m0tu8u,40,"Ok so I was playing video games and relaxing then my mom told me that she heard I asked my bf to go to my uncles wedding. Well since its my uncles wedding I only asked him and his fiancé since ya know its their wedding. Well my mom got mad that I didnt talk to her about it. I didnt see a need to. In my opinion its not anyones business that isnt getting married. Its just between me, my bf, the bride and the groom. So she was like, “why didnt you tell me? Im your mom? We’re family!” Well I just shrugged cause tbh family means almost nothing to me. Im not big on family and havent been for years. So she kept getting offended and was hurt by me not talking to her so I shrugged again and said, “we’re just not close. This family gossips and talks too much so I just keep to myself and stay private.” Then that made her even madder she was like, “Don’t you think I’m a good mom!? What have I done for you to treat me like this? I didn’t do anything to you for you to do this to me!” Tbh I just blinked and stared at her because I don’t see what she’s mad about. I talked to my aunt and uncle when they came for Christmas about Joseph as my plus one. I don’t need approval from anyone else. So she started screaming about how she fed me and clothed me and how shes struggling to pay for the house and how if she doesnt get a loan then we’re gonna be homeless by July. At some point she started saying how I treat my dad better than her and he doesnt do anything for me. I barely talk to him every once in a while I ask him something but he thinks like I do and ik I can trust him if I have a secret cause he just exists. But after that I didn’t react because that has nothing to do with anything. Then she started talking to my brother about me being ungrateful and hating her when she didnt even do anything wrong after a while of complaining and whatnot I just quietly left and went to my room and closed the door.So she got mad mumbled something under her breath took my brother and left. Im still in my room butI honestly dont get what she’s upset for since who i bring as a plus one to a wedding isnt her problem. I was wondering if im TA for not caring?Edit to add: Sorry if it makes no sense I’m not very good at recounting stuff in detail as it happens it just kind of happens. I tried to add as much info as I can but if it feels like something is missing just say something. Also added: I did try to tell her that I’m just a private person but she didnt like that answer. I tried before to talk to her about how I feel or whatnot but she just dismisses it. I just stopped trying after a while.Does anyone know how I can post images? I can update yall with texts from my mom and I."
184,Not the A-hole,AITA for walking out after being told one kid was autistic and another kid had a deathly food allergy,19970,lzsbi2,1450,"I (f16) babysit on weekends for some extra money. I used to babysit for this one lady, Diana, and her 2 kids (1f and 4m) every day over the summer while Diana worked. Diana texted me last week and asked if she can give her friend, Jennifer, who has 2 kids (6M and 4F), my number because it was her husband’s birthday and they wanted to go out. I said sure and Jennifer texted me asking about my rates, references, when I was trained in cpr, and a lot of other questions. Ngl it felt kinda weird to me but some people are overprotective so I went with it. Yesterday I got to their house and they left money for us to order food and right before they walked out the door, Jennifer handed me an epipen and said “6M is deathly allergic to peanuts and 4F is autistic and has sensory issues so get her some chicken nuggets.” It took a second for me to process that but I gave back the epipen and said “I’m sorry but I’m not equipped to take care of your kids.” And I left. Well, Jennifer is mad that I “ruined their night” and has been talking shit about me to Diana but once Diana heard the real story she apologized and said she’d talk to Jennifer. AITA for walking out of a babysitting job when I learned one kid has a deathly allergy and the other kid was autisticEdit: I wanted to add that I spent 6 months volunteering in a special needs classroom and I have some health issues so I know how to give shots, although I’ve never used an epipen, so if they would’ve told me before, I probably would’ve taken the job and just watch a few videos on how to use an epipen. I was mostly just in shock and worried that other things would come up too that they didn’t tell me about."
185,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not ""helping"" my parents financially?",61,m0lide,32,"Trying to make a short post. I (18,F) pay for my college, wich is expensive where I'm located at (not the US). I have payed the tuition and this months payment and I will have to pay the one for next month soon. I have that money available and will do so when they open the payment options.The issue is that my parents want me to lend them the money that I have.  My mom (39, F) says that they will return it on the 31st so I will be on time to pay. She has done this before (Last year I lended her the money for my payment and she returned it late, and then started to ask for it so I ended up having to ask for a loan at my job that left me with no money for holiday season). I feel it wasn't fair.I have offered my dad (46, M) the option of helping them if he compromises to pay (he is the only one working so I wanted him to reasure me that I would get my money back before the payment deadline) and he just avoided it.Now, they are asking me to go to different banks and ask for loans that they say they will pay. They both have horrible credit scores and were deep in debt. My mom is clean now, she payed off everything with my first job's wages.I feel that I might be in the wrong because they do leave me live here and feed me. I try to give a monthly amount, it's not much but I don't have much left after paying for college. I have considered moving out and living on my own but that would mean to stop stuying, there aren't many options for credits or scholarships for my career.If they don't get the money they won't be able to enroll my brother (11, M) for school this month. They won't put him on a public one because it's too dangerous (I do agree with this) but they are mentioning it like I don't want my brother to study, which isn't true or saying that I will die alone because I only worry about money and I don't love my family.So, here I am reddit, AITA? Should I just give them the money and pray so they pay me back on time? Am I stopping my brothers education?Thank you for reading, stay safeEdit: just typos"
186,Not the A-hole,AITA for ''tricking'' an ethnic woman into saying my name when I knew she wouldn't be able to?,5083,lzwlx3,623,"Okay so the headline sounds weird but I couldn't think of how else to say it. Also on mobile, English is not my native language. For background, I had to go to a meeting at my childs daycare with two other parents. I (f28) am Norwegian and I have a very scandinavian/norwegian name, its very common in my country but I've never met anyone outside scandinavia that can pronounce it right. Also, I live in an english speaking country now, my husband is from here. All this is relevant for the story. Now, when I entered the meeting I was met by the daycare owner, leader and the two other parents, Elle (f35) and Ann (38). The conflict is really between their two kids and its really tense between them, I only had to go to this meeting because my child got in the middle of the last conflict the two kids had and she got a small injury. So when I go into the meeting Elle was the first to greet me, and she basically said 'Hello I'm Elle, Theos mother'. Important to know is that Elle is from another ethnicity than the country we are living in, and she has a very special name, native to her country, and I've never heard it before. Anyway, I said hello back, and she got annoyed that I didn't greet her back using her name, like I said 'hello, I'm Maias mom'. She asked that I use her name, so I did, but I didn't say it completely right, and this made her even more annoyed and she said something like 'I really expect people to show enough respect for my culture, please learn to say my name right!' I apologized, told her I understood, no one here can say my name right either and I asked her to repeat her name once more. This really didn't help, she was still annoyed and insisted I repeat her name until I said it right. When I did, she huffed and said it shouldn't be this hard to show basic respect. This kinda pissed me off, so I replied back that then I expected the same respect from her, told her my name, and asked her to please greet me by my name. Ofcourse she couldn't, and though she did try, she couldn't say it right. Then I told her that she shouldn't expect more from people than she could do herself. The meeting continued, I went home and told my husband. He laughed, but said that it was kind of an asshole thing to do, because I knew she wouldn't be able to say my name like its supposed to be said. Which is true, like I said, my name is really hard to say right. My husband still can't. So I use a nickname, and I don't really get mad when people struggle with my name because I understand why. Also, everyone was not in a good mood at the meeting due to why it was held, so I probably should just have let it go. So, I asked my friends and they were kinda split in the middle, some said she got what she gave, and some said I should have just let it go. AITA?Edit: got a message asking about this and saying I should include it- I'm very scandinavianlooking, lightblonde hair, blue eyes and I'm very pale, and Elle has darker hair and skin, so I don't look like I'm not English. Elle is also from Europe, she is spanish.Edit 2: just to clarify a few things:We're not living in America Using the word ethnic is upsetting some people, which I understand, but I want to specify that my use of this word is not racist, as its a common term in Norway used to specify the country you're from. Like in the news, if say someone robbed a bank, it would say 'the arrested is an ethnicly norwegian man in his 30s'. Or ethnicly whatever country he is from. So my use her was to specify that Elle isn't ethnic to the country we live i , just like I'm not either. I don't blow up on people not being able to say my name because I know its hard. And I know some people aren't able to make the sounds needed."
187,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my sister in law to clean up her mess when she cooks at my house?,278,m0bu3k,76,"Ok, so little backstory, my hubby and I, along with his mom and her boyfriend, moved to our new house in August. Ever since we moved in his brother, his brothers wife, and their two kids have come up and she usually cooks, but she leaves her dirty empty dishes on my stove, they leave their dishes on the table, don’t wipe up anything, the kids are running around eating leaving food dropped everywhere, along with my sons toys they play with everywhere. So I’ve very nicely asked her twice to clean up after herself after cooking and eating (mind you, I’m a vegetarian, just because I don’t like the taste/feel of meat, so I don’t even eat, and they eat so late neither does my son) so now I just had another baby 9 days ago, they came over Saturday, and I told her in front of everyone, ‘Hey when your done eating please wipe up, and don’t leave dirty dishes on the stove. Thanks!’ So now today her husband called mine and was all pissed off that I asked her to clean up after herself. And to top it all off my husband was actually starting to side with them before I gave him my side of the story!!! Also majority of the time the brother and wife dissapear for hours, don’t say anything, and I’m left with all the kids. I feel like I’ve been very nice, but I’m tired of it! AITA for this???? TIA"
188,Not the A-hole,AITA for having other friends than just my autistic friend?,34,m0pi79,35,"My friend Fiona is on the autism spectrum and has social anxiety, and trouble making friends. Her only friends right now are me and my other friend Kaylee. I don’t have classes with Fiona or Kaylee so I made different friends in the classes I have. Some of my new friends don’t like Fiona because she has meltdowns and acts weird at school. To be honest I am a bit embarrassed to be seen around Fiona when she has meltdowns. So at lunch I sit with my new friends instead of Kaylee and Fiona.Fiona is upset because she has social anxiety and gets anxious around other people, and thinks that I shouldn’t be allowed to make friends because she can’t.Kaylee agrees with Fiona. She thinks I’m being “ableist” because I’m not spending time with Fiona because of her autism. Her constant meltdowns are causing **me** stress. Fiona even told me I’m “turning into Kaitlynn”, something that happened years ago where our friend Kaitlynn sat at a different table at lunch, that Fiona is still hung up on. I know that Fiona does have autism but it’s not an excuse for her to start screaming in the cafeteria because her food was “too crunchy”.Is making new friends really being “ableist” against Fiona?"
189,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my new SIL I didn’t feel like her “real sister” since she didn’t invite me to her wedding,2979,lzytp9,375,"So my brother got married and his wife apparently didn’t think it was important enough to invite her new husbands family....my brother called me yesterday and told me they got married and I was speechless. My brother and I were always extremely close growing up. I of course congratulated him but felt very hurt. And all he was talking about was when his MIL dies how they’re going to get like 3 houses and how her family is so rich...but anyway we haven’t really gotten a chance to get to know her bc they’ve only been together for a little over a year and any time we invite her to anything (birthdays, holidays etc) she’s always “sick”....the first time we were supposed to meet (oct 2019) at my birthday dinner she went shopping with my mom and brother and then got a headache and went home before I could meet her...She came to Christmas 2019 and nothing else she always makes an excuse. Anyway I guess she knew I was going to be upset she didn’t invite us to the wedding so she called me and told me she was “excited to have a new sister”...I told her it didn’t feel like a sisterly thing to not invite me to her wedding and I didn’t feel like a real sister....she got mad and hung up on me and blocked me....AITA?ETA: they invited her family and friends...**IM ALSO MAD AT MY BROTHER!!! I had a separate convo with him I didn’t write on here!! This is  SPECIFICALLY about my conversation WITH MY SIL!!**Further info: When my brother told me about the wedding he said that his wife planned *everything* including guest list and just gave him a time and a place to show up  and by the time he saw we weren’t invited it was too late and he didn’t want to start a fight on their wedding day....there were about 20 ppl there and our family would’ve been only 4 people....*okay I’m going to add this again.* **I am mad at my brother. I’m not putting all the blame on SIL. however this post is about the convo I had with her. Which is why I’m not talking about my brother that much!!! I don’t need Reddit to tell me if he’s the asshole—I know he is!!**Also, the wedding was apparently planned in about a week"
190,Not the A-hole,AITA for not helping my roomate move out?,93,m0h39r,17,"Ive been living in a huge 3 storey house at an unbeliavable rent rate for about 3 years very close to where I work. My previous roomates were engaged and bought a house, I wanted to keep the house so I brought in Doug who just found a job at the same company I work for. Being in a scramble to find a third roomate, my previous roomate tells another work friend ""Sam"" about our arrangement. I know Sam from before (this story is about him), its a bit sad but he always makes it too easy to be the butt of the joke, hes overall a nice guy. I tried to get anyone else before agreeing to take in Sam. He always told stories of clashes with landlords and how bitchy or overcontrolling they were. I agree to take on Sam to keep the house being short of alternatives. I also switched to paying our landlord month to month so long as we keep the same rate. I pay the rent and utilities, Sam and Doug pay me. Only a few weeks in, it became clear why Sam had so much trouble with landlords. Im not the tidiest person but Sam was very messy and had some disgusting and annoying habits. He'd leave pots full of food in the sink for days, leave all his food and open containers on top of the counters, play stuff on his ipad at full volume from 7AM while walking all around the house, throw food in the garbage and not close the lid to stink up(we have compost) and practically saw any unused corner of the house as his, but would not help clean any of it. Parking was a problem, we had 2 spots (garage and driveway) and we had 3 cars. Rather than helping me find a new spot he took over the garage and bought a ton of heavy workout equipment and turned it into a gym, no tickets during COVID but still. Doug and I mostly kept to our rooms, particularly when the pandemic hit, so most of this was annoying but was tolerable.By end of february our landlord decides to list  the house for sale because he wants to move out of the country. We would be expected to leave by end of April. Sam is very upset about having to move out. he doesnt have family close or people to help him move, I agree to help when time comes. By law we have 2 months from date of sale to leave,  and rent prices are overall cheap,it sucks but Im not that worried. Without telling us, Sam gets a rental and tells us he will move by early March. Then he asks if he can stay 15 more days. He then demands to get his deposit back, i tell him to deal with the landlord because I dont have his deposit and Sam didnt give me any notice, so he is only screwing me over. He lies about asking the landlord. So i end up vouching for him and convinced the landlord to let me and Doug stay an extra month for only our share of the rent for the inconvenience, but says he cant return Sams deposit. At this point I overhear Sam say he is moving this this week and counts of on my help and Dougs. I already had something loosely plannned for his move date, and since he hasnt asked me directly im not planning on helping though I promised. AITA?"
191,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking who is responsible for all the golf balls on our property on social media?,2599,lzz0wc,277,"We have lived in our house almost ten years. For the past few years, we often find golf balls on our property and have asked the one neighbor who we know is responsible to stop. The wife has stopped responding to my texts and the husband has assured us they have addressed it with their son. Recently, I was mowing and found at least 18 golf balls, some of them after I ran over them and there was a huge mess. It also damaged the blades on the mower. We have new neighbors, so I posted on the social media group a picture of all the golf balls and asked whoever is responsible to please stop littering our property. I soon received an unfriendly text from the wife of the original culprit, so I deleted the post. My husband thinks I was a jerk and should not have posted, but I honestly thought they were coming from elsewhere since they have assured us it was “handled”... but apparently they knew he was still lobbing projectiles onto our property. The wife has been very unfriendly since and has asked when they can come pick up the golf balls, but I do not want them to pick them up, I want them to stop littering our property. I am the AH for posting on social media and not returning the golf balls?"
192,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my mom I'm tired of being treated like the adult?,2204,lzzz03,85,"I (16f) have a complicated relationship with my mom. After my sister died my parents marriage fell apart and she moved on with her husband. She kind of left my wellbeing behind in it all and then she threw herself into making the marriage work. She has tried really hard to bond with his daughter and goes out of her way to try and give her everything, maybe even more than her husband, who I do not have a positive relationship with. It has even spread into my mom giving me shit when my dad buys me anything or takes me anyplace that her stepdaughter has expressed an interest in. But she and her husband never expect her mom to include me. One time my dad was taking me to Disney for a weekend and she threw a huge fit because he wouldn't take her husbands daughter with us and she got so mad at me for not making my dad take her too. She told me I needed to be grown up enough to advocate for ""my sister"" and that I needed to be a good and responsible sister. Another time my grandma got us both dresses for a family party. The other girl wanted mine because it was a color she liked and even though I loved it and had picked it myself my mom gave it to her and made me wear the other one. She told me to be mature and grown up about it. Which annoys the shit out of me most of all because she and I are the same age. And I'm only four months older. But apparently I'm the ""big sis"" which I don't consider myself. I'll always be the little sister. To my actual sister.Anyway, I decided last year to stop coming to my mom's as much and my dad helped figure that out in court. Then when lockdown was ordered my mom tried to get me to stay there and I said no. Then she started asking and I told her I needed space. It then became a constant and I eventually told her I'm sick of being treated like the adult in the relationship. Being expected to act as a go between for her and my dad when he won't agree to her shit and expected to put someone else's feelings above mine all the time. I told her I am still meant to be her kid and one of the two kids in her household but she treats me more like I'm one of the parents.She decided that was a shitty thing to say because I'm old enough to act mature and more like a young adult than a child. She said I was being an asshole pulling back for a reason like that.AITA?"

We had class together so we became friends and became friends with some of his friends. I just wanted to make it known that I am Indian.There was this TikTok going around school, no one outside our school really knew about it, but it was basically a video of an Indian dude saying something but it was edited (by somebody else) so that afterward, some Indian music would start playing. As an Indian, I didn't feel too good about it, but I didn't say anything. A lot of people would talk about it and share it with others and laugh about it. Even my friend, W, and his friends. They would continuously ask me and the only other Indian (""K"") in that group to make an impression of the video. K would do it, just because they were friends, and then they'd start making fun of him and mocking him. I would always say no because I didn't want to be mocked afterward. It started getting worse, they would keep humming Indian music around me and they'd ask questions such as ""Do you eat curry every day?"" ""Are your Indian friends poor?"" ""Can you show us an Indian accent?"" I told them that it was rude to ask me those questions and I didn't want to answer and I asked them to stop, but they told me that I need to chill out. I just decided to stop talking to them. One day, W and his friends saw me and they were asking how I'd been because I hadn't talked to them for so long. I told them I was good, and then they asked why I stopped talking to them. I told them it was cause they were asking rude questions and they wouldn't stop even though I told them to. They once again started telling me to chill out and I just got really upset and told them off. I called them all jerks and said that they make me super uncomfortable and I do not want to be friends with them. I was obviously very upset and they told me that I ruined the vibe. That I seriously need to calm down because it was just jokes and they don't think ""I'm like the stereotypical Indian."" I just walked away after that. Their other friends started talking shit about me saying I was calling them racist (I never did). They said that I was making a big deal out of nothingIdk, maybe I should've just let it go, cause most Indians at my school didn't really care or they dealt with it. AITA?"
195,Not the A-hole,AITA for not inviting someone to free buffet when I got set up by the person I wanted to invite?,176,m0cwzj,46,"There was a small lucky draw in the office and I got 2 coupons for free buffet. Being someone who doesn't exactly plan ahead I decided to ask colleague J, whom I close to, to join me after work for dinner using the coupons.I got turned down, which wasn't very surprising considering that was last minute arrangement.Soon after J then asked me to invite colleague C instead. For information, me and C aren't close. In fact, C is the shy and quiet type who does her work alone without interacting much with the rest of the team. It is maybe because of that that J wanted me to invite her instead, to make her feel included.However, by then I no longer wanted to use my coupons and decided that I want to keep them for the time being. I shrugged at J, said ""Nevermind,"" and went back doing my work.After work I saw C waiting for me near the exit and she shyly told me that J told her that I have invited her to the  free buffet for dinner. I was dumbfounded as I have never told J that I was going to go with C.I told C that it was a misunderstanding and I was not going to use my coupons that day. It was very awkward and C went very red, to the point of almost crying that I felt sorry that J set us up but I already decided to maybe go with my sister some time in future. Shit turned real next morning when J told me that I should have gone along with it because it was an important bonding moment for us, because C is very shy and nobody ever invited her anywhere. I defended myself saying that I did not agree with her set up and I had every right to use my coupons whenever I can with whoever I want. My other colleagues did not say anything about this incident but I feel like they also think that I was being nasty to C. So AITA?"
196,Not the A-hole,AITA for feeling like I’ve been setup?,35,m0nng9,43,"TLDR despite my anxiety and history around money, I agreed to financially merge with my partner when we started our relationship as a sign of implicit trust (I earn considerably more and have more assets). The other day they told me they were worried if they left me they would have nothing. I feel.....like I’m distrusted? Am I the asshole for questioning their intentions and feeling like I’m not trusted suddenly?They are down as named recipients on all my assets, stocks and shares should anything happen. But I am not on theirs.  Long versionWhen we got together my partner was keen that we merged financially. I was clear it was something I was uncomfortable with but leaned into as a sign of unquestionable trust. My partner had always been keen we are unified and integrated. So the other day when I mentioned about topping up the last bit of my cash free ISA it sparked a conversation how they needed their own savings.....How it would f*ck them over if they left me as I have considerably more assets and money than they do. Which, I’ve shared openly and put them down as named recipient of something happens to me. However their assets (a house from before we got together) is in their name only and I have been contributing to it each month to pay the mortgage. It also turned out that despite wanting the cars to be “ours” they actually pushed back when I mentioned about a joint insurance policy and unifying our lineup. It turns out they want their own insurance, their own car, their own documentation with their name on (not mine). I am very confused as the words are conflicting and don’t match the actions. I feel like I’ve tackled my own own demons to show trust and my willingness to integrate, but suddenly this “if they leave the relationship” and wanting things in their name is making head spin. I’m being assured they don’t want to end the relationship and this isn’t some ploy to get my assets and investments. But I don’t know what to make of the situation, my heads spinning and it’s a complete whiplash feeling as we’ve had no issues. Am I the asshole for bow questioning their intentions and feeling like I’m not trusted?"

I have one neighbor that let’s just call DD or Dog Dude who is a dog breeder that has like 10 golden retrievers. He does crappy things like burn brush that smokes up the hole neighborhood, takes all his dogs on walks up and down the road without leashes, very poorly trains his dogs which leads to it taking like two minutes for him to round up his dogs so you can drive by, he lets his dogs just run at you making a lady fall to the ground one time and he doesn’t discipline them and he just says sorry, and finally he lets his dogs poop in the middle of the road and in other peoples yards just not in his. His dogs keep pooping in my yard and I keep asking him to stop letting them and he won’t. One time he just let his dogs poop in my yard while I was doing stuff in it and when I confronted him  he just said “I cant help where they want to go. Just pick it up.” Well one day I said enough is enough and when he let his dogs poop in my yard I went out there with a shovel and threw it back in his yard. He came out of his house yelling at me asking why I threw poop in his yard and I told him to stop letting his dogs poop in my yard and I won’t do it again.

199,Not the A-hole,"AITA for wanting to throw my friend out, even if it left her homeless?",52,m0k0ew,22,"Okay, this happened years ago, but I am still getting shit from my parents about this. I don't think I'm the asshole, but my parents definitely do.Some background information first. Growing up, I had this friend who I'll refer to as Selena (24f). She had an incredibly screwed up family life. It was bad enough that CPS and the police got called to her house on numerous occasions but she just fell through the cracks.Selena had some mental trauma. I was a little bit of an outcast because I had my own mental illness and struggles going on, so we bonded over that. She saved me from a really bad decision that could have drastically changed the course of my life. For the most part, she was there for me when I needed her and vice versa. As we grew up, I started to had access to supports that she didn't (therapist, medication, parental support), and moved forward in my recovery. We started fighting more and I was becoming less interested in being around her because she was exhausting to be around.I went to college and we stopped talking. During my sophomore year, I get a text from her asking if it was okay if she slept at my house because it was starting to get too cold to sleep in her car. My parents said okay, but what I thought was going to be a couple of nights turned into her staying for over a year.My parents are borderline saints. I did not inherit their genes for limitless kindness. I'm all about boundaries. When Selena moved in, she lived rent-free and my parents did her laundry, cooked for her, and drove her around. I started to get resentful because my parents would tell me that she never cleaned up after herself, didn't tell them if she wasn't coming home (she would disappear for a few days at a time and my parents would be worried), and constantly relied on them for rides but they both work full time.We got into a massive fight and afterwards, I told her that she needed to move out. She didn't move out for another two or three months, and it put a serious strain on my relationship with my parents. My parents told me that they were adults and could handle themselves and decide who to invest their time and energy into. They said that they didn't mind helping someone who was ""down on their luck"" and ""needed a helping hand"" and that I was the one who asked them if she could move in the first place. They didn't want to be responsible for leaving someone homeless. I told them she was a young adult who was more than capable of showing minimum appreciation, and if she wanted to be ungrateful, she could do it from the curbside.Anyway, I was talking to my mom the other day and she mentioned how she still disapproved of my ""throw her into the streets if she is going to be an ungrateful bitch"" way of thinking. I don't think I'm being too callous, but I also think she's a dysfunctional bitch so there is chance that my opinion is bias."
200,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for not doing carpool for my brother?,21,m0qiz5,22,"My brother is part of a carpool with some other parents of kids at his daughters school. So he only has to pick up his daughter and the other kids a few times a week.My brother needed to pick up a second job because he needed the money as he had several unexpected expenses. Because of the time for this job and his old job he won’t be available to pick up the kids and he can’t drop them off in the morning either.Since I don’t work he has asked if I can take over his pick up days. He already asked the other parents if they would be okay with me doing it and they said okay as they already met me.The thing is I just don’t want to deal with other people’s kids and be responsible for them at all. I know it’s only a few times a week  and will probably only be responsible for the kids for 30-40 minutes (my estimation based on location of school and their houses). Still that feels like a lot of time to me to have them and have them in my car. Especially when I know these kids and they can be rambunctious to put it nicely.I know my brother is in a pince though so I instead offered to just drop off and pick up my niece everyday since he wouldn’t be part of the carpool anymore. I know that would be a lot more time for me overall, but I’m much more comfortable with just driving my niece. My brother is not happy with that idea because he’s afraid of getting on the other parents bad by leaving them on the lurch without anyone to cover those days. Apparently they have been very flexible with him in the past so he thinks because of this they will not include him in carpool next year and instead find someone else. This would be an issue because he will need help with picking and dropping off niece next year and I won’t be around then."
201,Not the A-hole,AITA for screaming at my mother?,10,m0unon,5,"TW: abusesorry for any spelling mistakes.I'm pretty new to this, but I just need advise.I (28F) moved back in with my mother in March last year, so she wouldn't be lonely during lockdown and due to issues with my flat-mate at the time. It's been mostly okay, but as time has gone on my depression has spiralled.I've been feeling pretty bad and honestly, being around negativity constantly, makes me feel worse. My mother complains about her job, people, family etc. I completely understand that everyone needs to whinge about life from time to time, but it is all she talks about. Normally I try hard to just respond and be interested, but how I'm feeling has really changed my ability to do that.A couple of days ago, I sat her down, and told her it was too much for me. I said something along the lines of 'I understand wanting to complain, but it feels like that is all we talk about and it's making me feel worse. Can we please talk about other things, as it's been really affecting how I feel'. At this point, I also think it's worth mentioning that I've had a similar conversation when I was a child with my mother, asking her to not to lambast my dad during their separation. Her response then, and unfortunately this time, was 'well then we'll not talk'Normally I'm relatively level-headed, but I lost my absolute shit. I was abused as a child by a family member, however none of my family believe me. It has impacted nearly ever single aspect of my life since, but my mother hasn't ever tried to help me even as a child and hasn't spoken about this with me in 14 years. I have always put her feelings before mine and never mention it, so I won't hurt her. But when I say I lost my shit, I started screaming how I was abused as a child and had to listen about how hard it was for her that my family member (who abused me) was depressed, but when I am it doesn't matter. I also screamed about how bad things are in my head, but clearly she wouldn't care about that.We haven't spoken since. I can't decide if I should apologise, but there's a part of me that really believes she should be apologising to me. I know that most likely she will just pretend it never happened.So reddit, I know this might be stupid, but AITA? I know I shouldn't have screamed at her like that. I know that the topic is probably really hard for her, but I just couldn't hold it in anymore"
202,Not the A-hole,AITA for breaking a promise my parents made me do when I was 18?,9486,lzs733,673,"A bit of background information: My (25f) parents immigrated to France before I was born to be able to offer a better life for their children. I am the oldest of 5 and had a strict childhood growing up, looked after my siblings, always had good grades, behaved and listened mostly etc. My main motivation was knowing that I can live my life how I wanted once I became an adult.Fast forward to me turning 18 and choosing which university I should go to. My parents told me that I should pick a town in France that was maximum a 3hrs drive away. I secretly apply to British universities, because I want to study English and got accepted. My parents said: ‘Fine, you can go since you got accepted, but you have to promise to come back home after your studies.’ Being 18 years old, I just did what they told me to so I could go without thinking too much about the consequences. Fast forward to now: After completing a degree in English and Education which took 5 years, I found a job as a teacher in the UK and stayed. This is now my 2nd year of teaching. I have a boyfriend of 5 years, pay for my own apartment and have not relied on my parents (financially) for years now. My mum demands that I come back home, start living in their house and find a job in France. She wants me to throw my life in the UK away, because of a promise I made when I was 18. I just want to live my life how I want instead. They make me feel guilty for not keeping that promise and even set an ultimatum (it has to happen now or never). My mum thinks that I will never come back if I do not come back home this summer. This pressure/guilt I feel has strained our relationship.By the way: my parents are healthy and well and do not need me in France. Of course, I would be with them if they needed support. The way I see it they are upset that their oldest child left the nest and has no intention of coming back any time soon.AITA for not keeping the promise I made when I was 18?Edit: My parents immigrated from Bosnia which has a Muslim/Eastern European culture with very patriarchal values. Family and having children is important, strict household, girls cannot go out as much as guys, girls do everything around the house etc. There are no arranged marriages, but parents like to have a big say and often recommend a potential partner who has been well researched and approved of. He would have to be from the same religion/cultural background for my parents to accept him. They do not like me having a boyfriend from a different culture. my current boyfriend is British.I accepted all this while living with my parents out of respect to that culture, but I always knew that I would not like to live my life according to their rules. I want to travel and work in different countries, marry much later in life and I do not want children. These are all things my parents disapprove of. During my first 2 years at university, my parents helped me out financially. They did not say that there were any strings attached. Helping your children go through uni if you can is another cultural thing. They are helping my other brothers right now who are also at uni. The rest of the siblings are in high school and can look after themselves so they do not need me for childcare services."
203,Not the A-hole,AITA For having a panic attack?,2,m11gjd,10,I'll be brief cause my previous post was removed for being long. I'm 22 m and I'm currently living with my mom and grandparents cause covid. My mom and I went yesturday to transfer ownership of the phone number I use from her to me while also getting a chip for my new phone that is a hand me down from her since she got a new phone and her old one is better than the one I was using. After 2 hours standing up (she got a chair) she did her part left while I did my part. Tested the phone for calls worked forgot to test the internet plan on the phone. I been having troubles with mental health for years my mom knows and a few days ago I finally ask for her to help me pay for a therapist. I'm a full time college student so I don't have that much money. She then interrogate me as to why I believe I need one and eventually she agreed to and we already found one who I'm going to start seeing on the afternoon of this day (is currently 1 am) A while after leaving the store I realised I didn't have any internet yet. My mom asked if I checked before leaving the store and I confess I didn't. She got mad and started calling on to why I didn't do it. I started to lose it and had an anxiety attack during which my mom told me to cut it out cause it wasn't a big deal  I told her the attack was of the way she was scolding me and she got mad and said that I always blame her for my problems and that I always play the victim cause I'm never at fault. I stoped manage to calm myself down and we went back to the store and fixed the issue. For my mom it seems that was that but now I wonder. Was I the AH for the way I reacted to her scolding and then saying the attack was her fault? She always scolds me with a very severe tone and when I was little she would scream at my face so even to this day she terrifies me.
204,Not the A-hole,AITA for not giving my number out for a group project everyone else is falling behind in?,538,m06eo3,49,"I kind of feel like an asshole, but I’m  really not trying to be. I’m taking a fully online class, no zoom meetings, everything done through canvas. I’m in research group for this class made up of myself and 5 other people. Our research proposal is due tonight, this is the week we were supposed to work on it, and... nobody has really worked on it but me. I set up a group discussion on canvas, outlined my ideas for the proposal, received an okay from one other student, and then nothing. From anyone. Until tonight.I went ahead and completed the proposal and made an announcement updating everyone asking them to please add whatever they think would be good to include and at least, bare minimum, type their own name on it so we have their stamp of approval to turn it in (one other person has added their name so far). This is all relevant at the end, not just me ranting, I promise!Most of my announcements and discussions went ignored until today, when someone suggested we make a group chat. The thing is, I’ve had experiences being cyberstalked in the past and... seriously, just, never again. I have a new phone number now and I’m extremely strict with who I give it out to. I give a google voice number to most people and there’s no issue, but I don’t think they support group chats. I said I’d prefer to keep our communications on canvas so they’re all in one place.I feel like I might be the asshole because obviously they’re having a hard time keeping up with the group work and maybe having text notifications would help remind them better/keep them more in the loop.EDIT: thank you so much to everyone for the advice! I feel a lot better about everything and now feel kind of silly for thinking I was being an asshole lol. I received some great suggestions for group messaging apps for future reference- and will definitely be communicating with my group members about sharing tasks in the future!"
205,Not the A-hole,WIBTA If I Went to My Aunt’s Without My Sister?,8,m0wjey,10,"To start things off: I use mobile so apologies if my formatting is jacked up. Also, I tend to be a bit wordy at times, so I am sorry if I tend to repeat myself often!In March of last year, my (15F) little sister (10F) was supposed to have a surgery to get her tonsils taken out. Because she would be a lot of work to take care of while she recovered, my mom was planning to let me go to my Aunt’s during her recovery (maybe a little less than a week or so). Since Coronavirus hit my state pretty hard, my sister was not able to have her surgery, and in turn, I was not able to go. She eventually was able to get that surgery two months later.This is where I may be the asshole. I was invited over there again since I still have not gotten the chance to go see my Aunt and also because Coronavirus restrictions are being released where she lives. I am very excited! I never get to see her since she lives so far away and I have been anticipating this trip for over a year now. I am still the only one going.I told my grandmother about it and she was pissed off that I was the only one going. She thinks that it was stupid that my sister isn’t able to go as well. Same thing with my dad. My sister has also been dejected about it ever since she found out from him.Since they were annoyed by it, it’s making me worried that I am being selfish. Do I even have a reason to go by myself since she has already recovered? I realize this is probably really stupid, but it’s just been on my mind. I can’t tell if I am overthinking it or if I really should just back out of going.So, Reddit, would I be the asshole if I went?"
206,Not the A-hole,Aita: for deciding to move out.,65,m0gxph,56,"I could go on for a while but the 3000 character limit is going to make me condense a lot. My mother has always been hard to deal with. My wife and I got married in our 20's and my wife and her fight a lot and I am put in the middle. They do love each other but also hate each other.My father divorced my mother after 35 years of marriage and went on disability literally to keep from paying alimony. He did give my mother the house but largely to evade the government taking it. My mother has never worked a day in her life which means she had no money.My wife decided we should move in with her to help her. My grandmother passed away around that time and it was also her dying wish that we do so, and she spoke to my wife about it. So here we are 5 years later. We renovated the basement into a sort of apartment its only a living room a bedroom and bathroom. My daughter's have bedrooms but they are upstairs.The thing is we have no space, any time we go upstairs My mother wants us out immediately. She really didn't want us there anyways (she does want My daughters there) but we pay all the bills and without us she would 100% lose the house. There is no respect, she's constantly complaining, constantly reminding us of bills like we aren't going to pay them (we've never been late). She also has health problems, she is incredibly mean to my wife and she will throw tantrums like a child if I try to tell her she's being unreasonable. I don't feel welcome there at all, and I want to leave, and so does my wife but my entire extended family will disown me if I leave. Does this make me an A-hole if I leave?"
207,Not the A-hole,AITA for requesting a lawyer?,310,m094g2,73,"My (36F) little brother (30M) is growing up and wants to buy house with his girlfriend (28F). I think it’s a great idea that makes total sense given that rent is more than what they would pay as a mortgage, and at the same time, they get an asset.However, as most people their age in Europe, they don’t have a sufficient savings and property prices are insane and growing.They have asked for a little help from family to get on with the down payment (the gf family can’t help, so it all came to my family). Our parents (66F, 67M) could help financially, but since they are both retired recently, their savings and a small pension is all they have.Here’s the part where I might have been the A-Hole to my brother: I told my parents (they asked) that I was fine with this arrangement under two conditions:- internal in our family drafts a deal about what I call a ‘risky investment’: lending my brother the money, and let him pack it back when he can. I would lend 50% and my parents lend 50%) so that it’s not such a big risk for them.- contract between my brother and his gf: she owns half the house, minus the additional percent my brother put in (well, actually his family)My brother and his girlfriend, met with lawyer and seemed to be fine with lawyers proposal for ownership, (organized and paid for by my dad btw).Now, after that meeting brother said, he doesn’t want to involve us unless when it’s really needed. He says let’s organize the meeting later, when the final deal for the house is ready. He didn’t call me the A-hole, but is not very responsive, and is stalling the conversation.I truly believe the offer was more than fair - he will basically get the money without any rush to pay it back - and it also protects him and the money in case he and the gf breakup.However, since the meeting with the lawyer, he always mentions how his girlfriend has been doing all the work of searching houses, they both have been saving their salaries together, etc. Also, he never talks to us without her girlfriend being in the same call / also coming over.So, am I the A-hole for making all of these arrangements with my parents when I have not directly been asked by my brother (my parents asked me if I was OK with them helping out my brother, but it was a big burden for them), and would I be the A-hole if I now say that none of us will help if my brother doesn’t agree to meet us alone this week to finish the deal?Edit: to all of the people who say my brother and his girlfriend should wait until they get married - this is what they are doing - buying a house - so that they can have kids. I don’t think they really dream about a wedding."
208,Not the A-hole,AITA for being upset with my sister being more concerned with her gift than my well-being?,12,m0r63w,22,"I (23F) just got rejected from graduate school for a second time, but this time I, and everyone I talked to, thought I would get into my top choice, and I worked very hard. Needless to say, this hurts, and hurts even more because I had just managed to drag myself out of a depressive slump, and now I'm back in it.Anyways, the issue is how my sister (25f) reacted. Everyone I talked to comforted me, including her boyfriend, and heck, even her cats who usually hide from guests. When I mentioned it to my older sister, she just said she knew, and went back to ignoring me and talking to her friend. That hurt, and it was the day I found out. That whole evening she was rude to me, and when she wasn't rude, she was ignoring me.The next day, she came over with a gift for our dad, and I asked her if she could please just leave me alone because I was having a hard time. She refused, and kept trying to shove the gift on me to give to our dad so it wouldn't ""get lost"", and the whole time I was holding back tears and trying not to cry because I was upset that she was more concerned about freaking hot sauce when she knew I had been dealing with depression and this rejection from graduate school.Anyways, I brought this up to my dad, hoping he would talk to her, and he said the first night, she didn't want to talk to me about it because she didn't want me to be embarrassed in front of other people. Ok, fine, but when I told one of our friends who was there, he was concerned for me and comforted me, so I think that's a weak defense. When I told him about the second event, he didn't seem to care and said I just ""didn't understand her."" Yeah, I don't understand how she could be so callous as to be more concerned with hot sauce than making sure her own sister was doing ok after distressing news.I told my dad this, and also explained that I would never even consider treating a friend the way she treated me, so why is it ok that she treats me like this, and he brushed it off as me making a big deal. However, she has done this many times. Whenever something good happens to me, she has to drag the attention back to her and I can't celebrate. When I graduated college, I wanted to stop and get a cake to celebrate with my friends because I knew there was a good chance I wouldn't see them for a very long time, and she threw a fit saying she was tired and didn't want to stop for five minutes so I could run in and get a cake. When I reminded our dad of this, he just said he didn't remember this, or any of the other things she's done.I sent her a polite text telling her that what she did was inappropriate and very hurtful and while she has seen it, she has not responded, and my dad refuses to try to mediate this.I just need to know, am I crazy for being upset about this? AITA for bringing this up and trying to get my dad to help me talk to her?"
209,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not sending a friend home with the takeout ""she ordered?""",4110,lzsx6i,180,"I'm currently living in a community where I don't know many folks, and my covid bubble is my family and one other family with a child a couple months older than mine (both kindergarten age.) My (36f) friend Liz (39f)'s kid is autistic and medically complex, so we are all fairly careful and enjoy having one other set of people we can see sometimes. Last night Liz and her kid came over to celebrate my child's birthday - they played, they wacked a pinata full of stickers, and I ordered us delivery from a family style place here we all love, with Liz having picked half and my family picking half. I paid for the full order. Right as I hit enter on the order, her kiddo started melting down. After about half an hour of it just escalating, Liz apologized for messing up my kiddos birthday and asked for a ride home for them. I think it's worth noting, when she made this decision she was HUSTLING to make it happen. So we get them together, and as we're walking out the door, delivery shows up, so I put it inside the door and ask my partner to put it in the oven on keep warm, then start moving towards my car, not noticing the look I'm getting from Liz. Last night a couple hours later I asked how they were doing and got left on read, which is usual. This morning I woke up to a slew of texts calling me an AH for not giving her ""her"" food from the party and forcing her to figure out a new dinner plan for a kid already melting down and wanting food she couldn't otherwise afford after he was promised it. It truly wasn't a conscious choice - I was focused on getting them home and not having my kiddo more upset. There are two social media posts passive aggressively griping about it too. So, tell me reddit, was I the ah for not considering I should pull the food she'd wanted out to send home with them?Edit: apparently Liz caught this post. In short she called to apologise for being out of line when she was exhausted and overwhelmed feeling and I apologised for not being a more thoughtful host and friend, and we're going to get the boys back together mid afternoon for some cake. All is back to normalnormal Edit 2: I woke up to my first awards and some kind messages. Thank you strangers!"
210,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting mad at my wife because she's making weird accusations?,718,m039pc,142,"I (M43) was hanging out with my wife (44), Jane, and I brought some candies that my aunt (my mom's sister), Mary, sent along with some other stuff my parents (65F and 70M) posted me from oversees (I now live in US). Then, Jane questioned why aunt Mary would send me something. I explained to her that it was my birthday and Mary like any other person loves their nieces and nephews. Also, she's not married and has no kids so she might have more time and attention for nieces and nephews. She then asked her age. I honestly was not sure. I texted my mom and turns out Mary is 15 years older than me.Then, Jane questioned her text messages to me and said those are inappropriate (she had checked my text messages before to be fair, I don't mind if she checks my phone whenever she wants, even if I'm not present if that will reinforce her trust). I was a bit shocked by her statement because the text messages between me and Mary happen 1-2 times per year and usually, she says ""Happy birthday! Love you my dear nephew"", and I reply ""Thank you, dear Mary. Love you too"". Sometimes a few more greeting sentences. Now, Mary has an unusual habit of overusing emojis, but she does that to every post and comment on IG, and she's a foreigner living outside US who learned social media 3 years ago in her mid-fifties.I explained all this to Jane, but she wasn't convinced. She continued asking me if she ever babysits me or hung out with me when I was a kid. I remembered Mary lived with my grandparents (different culture young adults stay with their parents until they study and find a good job), so whenever we went there Mary was there and we would talk.Jane then accused me that there should have been some very inappropriate relationship between us and it's disgusting and so on. At this point, I was very shocked and also mad. I admit I lost my cool and said with an elevated tone that how come she doesn't understand every uncle and aunt love their nieces and nephews. And this has been normal in my extended family and their love is like parental love or the love of an older and caring sister or brother. She wasn't convinced and she said this was not the case in her extended family (We are from the same country and speak the same language, but she belongs to a different sub-culture). She also blamed me for getting mad and said that also confirms her suspicion. But how did she expect me to stay calm when she makes these accusations?Later, I apologized for not being calm but said she was very unreasonable and suggested if she wants us to talk to a third person or a therapist to get some insight, to which she declined. I also asked her if she saw something bad in other people and is now projecting to me and she said no. But she is still upset and thinks I was not appropriate in my behavior to my aunt and she does not talk to me (except for the essentials). So, AITA?Edit1: Thanks everyone for your time and feedback. Some asked if there are any other details. There is one thing: a few days ago, Mark started texting Jane. Mark was her second boyfriend back when they were in high school. They broke up when high school finished. They are now Facebook acquaintances, but nothing unusual. Mark is married but recently he texted some weird things on FB  to emotionally guilt-trip Jane something like Jane broke his heart, and so on. My wife herself told me this. I suggested maybe she should block him or reply ""f\*\*k off"" or send the screenshots to his wife, but my wife did not do these, and just ignored his FB texts. Maybe her last-night behavior toward me was a come-back?Edit2: Wow, this post blew up. Never expected it. Thanks for all the support. Sorry that I'm not able to answer each comment. Just to clarify about the chance of Jane's cheating with Mark: it's very unlikely: I can't go into details, but one reason is that Mark lives on another continent, thousands of miles away.     I also edited some grammar and typos.Edit3: Some asked why did Jane accuse me now, not before? Yesterday, I told her that I hung out with my aunt as a kid, and she got very concerned because she previously thought the age gap was large, but now it seems less.  "
211,Not the A-hole,"AITA for ""Breaking Up"" the Flat?",9,m0ttw1,9,"So, I find this entire situation to be absurd, but I figured I'd do what any reasonable person would do and consult the internet for an unbiased opinion of the situation. I've made a post here a few weeks ago about a problem adjacent to this one but it got removed for not having actual conflict (was more of an inner conflict, my bad).Here's the situation. I (21m) moved into my flat last July that was already occupied by 3 others (25m, 25f, 23m) and because of a couple of different reasons I'm planning to move out in the next few months. I got a new job that's going to require me to move to a different part of the city, but also because I don't really like two of my flatmates anymore (25m and 25f, they're slobs and one of them acts very antagonistic and argumentative with basically everyone he speaks to). Also just money issues in general.I have been planning to move out for a while now but didn't actually tell them. Like I said, with the exception of 23m they're very antagonistic and argumentative and I didn't want to risk them damaging any of my stuff I keep in the communal area (not that I think they actually would, and they haven't (outside of the kitchenware I brought which they demolished with their disgusting lack of hygiene). I also didn't want to say anything until I got the job and knew I would be able to move.So, like I said, I got the job and last week I told them I'd be moving out at the end of May and 25m and 25 lost their shit.23m is also moving, because he's graduating, and it turns out he's planning to move out at the same time. They said that they can't afford to have us both move out at the same time and that I should have told them I was planning to move out because now they're stuck paying twice as much rent until they can fill our spots. They also accused me of ""breaking up the flat"" because now they need to get to know and ""befriend"" more people.Now, this kind of pissed me off, because we are most certainly **not** friends. I've been dealing with a lot of depression and anxiety for 90% of the time I've been here and have spent a lot of time keeping to myself. I barely leave my room, I've been living off takeout and the only time I really interact with them is when they come to start whatever argument they feel like having that day.Every conversation with them is either an argument or an interrogation. They constantly ask ""Why don't you ever leave your room?"" which is a fair question, but whenever I tell them it's because I'm suffering from anxiety and depression they just keep pressing with ""But why?"" and it's so annoying. It's been so exhausting to live with them. I basically told them all this and reminded they said I was being an asshole and that it's not their fault I never made more of an effort to socialise and so this is where I'm at.So, having relayed all (I think) of the relevant information, AITA? For not letting them know in advance that I'm leaving and not making more efforts to be social while I have been here?"

On mobile so apologies for format/typos <\3My (38F) partner of 9 months (40M) have built a relationship that is fairly tolerant of normal bodily functions. Like, we are all human bro get down with the fact our flesh suits do things we dont always want etc. Its good. Herein lies the problem. When he farts, which is fairly regularly, its e x t r a o r d i n a r i l y loud. But 95% of the time completly odorless. When I fart, which is usually only when I am unwell or if I have inadvertently eaten something I shouldent (I am allergy central) it is very much in the ""silent but deadly"" category. I try and rectify as much as I can by airing it away, but they can be pretty brutal. Anyway he has asked that if I am about to fart, I say ""quack"" to ""prewarn"" him so he can ""brace"" himself. And holy fuck I just cant bring myself to do it. I tried once, when I was just about to, i looked him dead in the eye and said ""quack"" and then laughed so hard that I spilt my wine and I am just not sure I can do this.He quietly gagged in the corner and helped me clean up my wine, but there has to be a better solution to this. Before you say ""just leave and go to the next room"" the vast majority of the time I dont know if I am going to fart, preempting it is very difficult for me. So, AITA for not saying ""quack""?"
213,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting a friend join my DnD group?,10,m0tr18,8,"I(F16) have been playing DnD with a group of friends for about 2 weeks now and it's been going great. We just finished a short play that was really to introduce some of the players (who are new overall) to the rules and how the game works. This group are my only other friends besides one, who we'll call jamie(F16). Jamie isnt necessarily toxic but me and her frequently argue over silly things like her asking me for advice and then doing the direct opposite, her making stupid decisions and then blaming others for her situation, straight up just ignoring me when I talk, stuff like that. I normally call her out on her bullsh\*t which tends to be the start of these arguments. We havent talked in a while due to me being pretty busy with school but when she called me up today and we were catching up, I told her a brief story about one of the players in the campaign. She just kind of ignored me and continued on with what she was saying. Then, somebody from the group messaged me in the discord server that we had set up so I responded. She could see that I was typing so she asked me what was up and I told her that I was responding to a friend of mine. She made a joke along the lines of ""You have other friends?"" and I simply said that it was somebody chatting in the server we made for the group. She said ""oh haha you should add me"" to which I kind of ignored and changed the subject to what she was talking about before. She then said, I think jokingly, ""what, do you not wanna add me or something?"" To which I just kinda dodged with, ""uh idk I mean not really lol. Our group is kinda full"" (Which was a full-a\*s lie, and a bad one at that) and she just kinda stared at me through the screen until she said ""Wow ok"" I responded with ""what? You have all these other friends and I cant have one thing to myself?"". At that point we kinda just sat in silence until she just said ""I'll call you back"" and hung up. Now I kinda feel bad for not just giving in and asking the members if it was ok to add her, AITA?"
214,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting mad at my dad for being passive aggressive?,8,m0tmc7,11,"My parents are very restrictive over my internet usage. I can't use most social media website and my wifi speed is reduced during the day until after I have proved that I have done all my homework, to develop good habits. I find this reasonable, but one of my grades recently slipped to a B, so my parents have been checking my homework thourougly. Usually I just check in with my mom, show her my assignments, and show that there is a submission to all of them.today mom was in a meeting, so I had to go to my dad. I explain to him the homework thing and he comes to check it. I show him most of my homework and he's fine with it, and on the last assignment he wants to see what I actually submitted, not just confirm I submitted something.This was ok with me, so I showed him the presentation, which was about Italy. Each slide took around 20 seconds to load because of the reduced wifi speed, so I just showed him the first 2 slides, and then i asked if i could just show him the slide preview to prove that I had enough slides. He said he wanted to look at the content (the first 2 slides were the title page and table of contents), so I showed him one more slide. It reads:Venice is also known as the “City of Canals” and the “The Floating City” is one of Italy's most photogenic cities. It has winding canals, amazing architecture and bridges.(and then some other stuff)He says that its too ""redundant"" that I mentioned canals twice. He demands that I go in and change it, then resubmit the assignment. I explain to him, although a little rudely at this point, that the assignment was due at the end of first hour today, and that I didn't want to resubmit it to make a small change and get late points taken off, but that I could still change it if it made him happy. So i ask him what he wants me to change, specifically, since I didn't see an apparent redundance. He says ""I think you should know"" I don't, and ask if there is anything SPECIFIC I could change. He says im being too ""stupid"" and that it was ""obvious"", before going to make another sandwhich. I raise my voice and tell him that I really didn't think it was redundant, and he just says ""come back when you're more composed"" and that ""it was all fine"" even though it obviously wasnt, so I scoff and leave. He's being very passive aggresive, but not outright rude.My dad controls the wifi, so I can't use anything since he didn't check my homework, I asked my mom and she says that I had a ""bad attitude"" like I'm 7 and says I should have atleast tried to fix the presentation. Am I the asshole for not trying to fix the ""obvious"" redundancy atleast once? this situation has happened multiple times before and it's always been that I have to apologize. Am I the asshole here?"
215,Not the A-hole,AITA for making my friend pay insurance after he hit my car?,454,m053ez,69,"My friend and I were leaving a Subway, and he swung in wide and hit the corner of the rear bumper of my car in the spot adjacent to where he was going to park. After a heated debate of whether or not we should file a report and let our insurance companies know (I insisted we did), he caved in (very hesitantly and upset) and we went through with it. He hasn't talked to me in a few days after the incident, AITA?  UPDATE: Just found out he was arrested and charged with conspiracy and intent to harm an individual and that was why he wasn't responding. Reminder not to OD on schrung"
216,Not the A-hole,AITA For nagging my husband to go to the doctor?,30,m0j9v7,31,"A couple of days ago my (31F) husband (37m) told me that while he was sitting in his chair he all of the sudden felt dizzy, the right side of his face went numb, and he became unable to speak. He did not tell me out of concern rather general bewilderment. I however instantly recognized the symptoms as a stroke or something similar and began to ask/beg him to go see a doctor. He refused saying he feels fine and whatever it was, only lasted a few moments. A little more than 24hrs late he got a massive migraine. On its own, nothing concerning, but in conjunction with the previous symptoms, I became more concerned. I explained that my Stepfather had ignored minor signs of a heart attack saying he was fine and then died a week later of a massive heart attack. Granted my stepdad was much older when he died but I still really want my husband to go get checked out. He says that we can't afford it (we would have to use savings) and that all a dr will do is tell him to lose weight. He then agreed to exercise more and eat healthier to prevent future issues. Last night he started throwing up. Again he says he is fine, just an upset stomach from a bad sandwich. I again begged him to go to the ER and he refused. When he told me he loved me, I told him he didn't love me enough to see a Dr. and walked away. I know he might be alright and going to get tests run may needlessly put us in debt. But I believe his health is more important. He has also been bugging me to give up dairy for over a month because he believes I am lactose intolerant and it makes me gassy. It doesn't give me pain so I haven't done anything about it. But I offered to give up dairy if he will just go to the Dr.  He won't budge. I have become distant and keep bringing up going to the Dr, which he says is just raising his blood pressure.  Seeing as my husband is an adult, it is his body and he believes he is fine AITA for not trusting him and dropping the issue?Edit: This has all happened within the space of 72 hrs if that matters.Edit: He broke down and went. It was a TIA. He didn't tell them about the headache or vomiting as both of the issues have resolved. They are running tests on his blood though and will be checking his arteries later in the week. "
217,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling my mom I'm happy she's happy but I'm not ""happy""",12,m0qe25,38,"I (19f) love my mom so much. We've always been close. And grew even closer after my dad died. Back in September she met somebody and she told me about it at Christmas. I told her I was happy she was happy and honestly tried to fake that I was happy happy. But I admit it was hard to hear. It's not that I'm not happy for her. I am so glad she's happy. But part of me I don't know, is crushed that there could be someone else. I always had this kind of fantasy that you can have this great love that can make you happy even if one passes away and that you would want to have other focuses in life but never find someone else. And I know that's a me thing and I would never put it on my mom. I would never pressure her.I met him twice. After the second time my mom mentioned something was off with me and wanted to talk. I told her I was fine just stressed but my mom knows me and I am a shitty liar and faker. Always was. And she told me I could tell her anything. So I did. I admitted that I was struggling and wasn't happy happy but I was happy that she was happy and I was trying to just work on it. She hugged me and was understanding and told me I could have all the time I needed. And she has been checking in on me and not talking much about her boyfriend.My grandparents however are pissed. They called me selfish and said I should be ashamed for making my mom feel like she couldn't be happy and open with me. They said I should have kept my mouth shut but more than anything I should just be happy and be wanting to get to know him and excited my mom can move on.I already felt bad but now I feel like shit.AITA?"
218,Not the A-hole,"WIBTA if I told my friend I can't go to her house anymore, because her husband won't stop vaping around me while I'm pregnant?",34,m0j6ok,25,"My husband \[36M\] and I \[29F\] visited our friends, let's call them Christina \[25F\] and Erik \[24\] this weekend. I'm currently 5 months pregnant with our first child. We have one simple rule - don't smoke around me. Simply go to the other room or step outside. Christina was considerate and smoked outside. Her husband on the other hand, kept blowing huge vape clouds that would fill the entire room. They have a small, trailer-style home, so the living room and kitchen are essentially one space. The first couple of times he did it, we glared at him and he apologized saying he forgot. Then he started going to the other side of the room but became lazier as the night went on, stepping only a few feet away from me. He kept giving excuses like, if he doesn't smoke he gets ""on edge"", ""the smoke will dissipate"" and ""it's not as bad as regular cigarettes."" I would try to step into the other room every time, but he would do it while we were in the middle of activities. For example, we were in the living room doing a pendulum painting, and he would be sitting on the couch vaping, so I couldn't immediately step away. In the morning, I told Christina about how upset it made me, and she replied that it was their house and I can't make him go somewhere else, but I could try telling him how I feel. The thing is, I already made it clear how I feel about being around smoke, but he doesn't care. I also found out he plans to continue vaping around his wife when she gets pregnant. WIBTA if I told her we can't go over to her place anymore if her husband can't even be bothered to go to the other room to smoke while I'm pregnant? My husband supports this decision. She's still my friend and they're still welcome to come over to our house, just as long as they smoke outside."

220,Not the A-hole,AITA for being upset that he didn’t text me that he was going to miss our call?,11,m0qo3j,24,"My (20F) boyfriend (20M) works at an animal shelter. He’s an animal science major and I love that he loves what he does. He worked really hard to get that placement. I go to school on the east coast and he goes to school on the west coast. It sucks but we’ve been together for 3 years and have been long distance for 2. We have shorter FaceTime calls through the week and on Saturdays we usually have a “until we fall asleep” call. On Saturday he missed the time that we agreed on. It was 8pm here and 5pm where he is. I got home from work like an hour before that. I didn’t get a text from him until hours later (like 12am EST) and I was asleep already. He texted me that he got to observe a surgery at an animal medical center and that the dog from their shelter he thought wasn’t gonna make it made it through the surgery. They think she’s going to recover okay and walk/stand etc. I guess when I didn’t respond (because I was asleep) he said wow so you just not gonna respond. I also had two missed FaceTime calls from him around 1am EST. When I woke up I said that I was happy that she made it ofc that’s always good news but you could’ve texted me that you weren’t going to make our call. He said it was short notice and that I was tripping for expecting a heads up. I said it would’ve taken 2 seconds to say “things got crazy here, not gonna make it” and he responded “which part of short notice did you not understand.” I stopped responding after that (and he started talking about something else the next day) because I wasn’t sure what to say and I’m not sure if I actually am in the wrong and should’ve been more understanding.

221,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my friend to step down as my maid of honor due to her husband making me uncomfortable.,5916,lzq8rj,434,"Hi, three weeks ago was my partner's birthday. Since it's been months since we organized we found a really awesome Airbnb but there was with a zero tolerance for smoking. Everyone smokes weed so I texted everyone beforehand they must smoke outside or on the heated smoke spot on the roof. Everyone agreed to follow the rules. It was 15 people. 4 of my friends and the rest my partner's friends and mutual friends.The issue is my friend's husband was so stressful and rude to be around, everyone decided they would rather drive an hour home then spend the night with us. He also kept shutting windows, and smoking in the place. I was charged a $100 fee for the smell. I also received a horrible rating on Airbnb. So that's just the logicistical issues. Now for the social, this man was so obnoxious, kept interrupting everyone, was being racist, sexist, and homophobic. At one point he went on a rant about mexicans, his wife is mexican so that extra horrible. He also kept humiliating her publicly. Like he kept trying to get people to bully her with him. Another rant he went on was how gays are evil. I am pansexual and everyone was just staring at me. He also mocked any man cooking and cleaning, demanding all the women do it. He also fought with everyone about which room they were staying in and demanded why no couple went off to have sex yet. Everyone challenged his bigotry but he got aggressive and ruder. All my partner's friends left due to stress and being upset. I also have a seizure disorder caused by stress. He told me it was all in my head and I should take medication. I advocated for myself, as did everyone else about what type of vibe reduces my Siezures, he actively ignored all pleads by me and everyone else to cool it as my Siezures results in me being pick up the floor and moved. I also freeze and stare off into place. So everyone had to help me unfreeze and snap me out of it. I tried talking to my friend about his behavior but she just dismisses it as alcohol. I'm the last friend of hers since no one else wants to be around him. She seems to love him dispute how mean he is to her.I told her two nights ago that unfortunately she can't be at the wedding since it's so small we want to make sure the vibe is right and the last get together was a nightmare. She told me I am an asshole for abandoning her. She said that she can't control him and it's not his fault he doesn't understand my condition. She also said she been through several of mine bad relationships and i'm an asshole for cutting her out of my wedding after being friends since we were kids. I just want my guests to feel comfortable and not have seizures on my wedding day. I don't want it to affect my relationship but I will say goodbye so I don't suffer Siezures around him. No one else in my life that I socialize with causes that. So am I the asshole?INFO request: I was just going to uninvite him. But we got into a fight as she told me my Siezures are my responsibility to deal with and his behavior isn't something she can control. I explained I can only have people on team ""anti-siezure"" at my wedding and if she doesn't want to respect my triggers and sensitivity to certain stimulus she can't come.No one kicked him out because it was very late and they lived an hour away. We were kind of scared of him getting violence or starting a fight. Everyone was high but me. I was suffering too many seizures. All the other guests all debriefed the next day and we all were remorseful bout how the event unfolded. Lessons this thread taught me: my friend is being abused. I need to not apologize for my disorder. I should tread lightly with this friendship to help but she needs to sit out if my wedding unless she is going to be respectful of my siezure triggers. Thank you everyone. This have been so beyond helpful. I feel so validated, understood, and we made a plan how to support her in the coming days."
222,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my dad to stop chewing with his mouth open?,6,m0tjle,30,"I'm 17, living with my parents, and I have severe misophonia. It's a sensitivity to certain sounds, which can make me irritated beyond reason (whereas it may not bother most other people). I can't help it, but I've gotten better at living with it over the past few years. One of my 'trigger sounds' (probably my worst one) is chewing. For some reason, my dad's chewing bothers me the most and he's noticed that I have more of a reaction around him compared to friends, grandparents, etc. Again, I can't help this or explain it, but it's very common in people with misophonia to have our biggest triggers be people we live with and see on a daily basis. I've asked my dad nicely if he could stop in the past. He's agreed, but nothing has ever changed, so I don't say anything anymore and try my best to ignore it.Anyway, the other day, I was talking with my mom at the kitchen island when my dad came over and started snacking on something right beside me. It bothered me, but I didn't say anything about it and tried to continue the conversation. I guess my irritation was evident on my face, though, because he said something to the effect of ""She always gets so annoyed when I eat.""I tell him that of course I don't have a problem with him eating, I would just really appreciate it if he didn't chew with his mouth open. I said something like ""Not only would it be helpful to me, but it's generally just polite to eat with your mouth closed.""He took a lot of offense to this comment and kind of blew up at me, saying that it may be good manners in a formal setting, but why does he have to police his eating in his own home? He basically compared it to wearing formal clothes and that everyone wears sweats in their house. Then he says that all of the people he works with eat like this too and nobody else is ever bothered by it.He just stormed off, and my mom asked me why I had to bring it up and be an asshole by making him feel bad about it. I explained that chewing is something that bothers me a lot and I don't think it's unreasonable for him to be a little mindful about it around me. I don't think it's a difficult change for him to make and it would mean a lot to me if he at least tried.So AITA for asking my dad to stop chewing with his mouth open?"
223,Not the A-hole,AITA for hanging a photo of my family (including boyfriend) in my apartment,14093,lznyj9,855,"My boyfriend (32M) recently moved into my (27F) apartment. We have been dating for a while (a little more than a year) and decided that it was time to make things serious. I have a daughter (6F) who also lives with me and visits with her father every other weekend. I work in a quite demanding job and my daughter used to either stay with my parents or be at a daycare while I worked. However, with the current state of the world, my boyfriend has been able to keep an eye on her mostly. I'm still in the house, but he's been doing stuff when I'm not able to like checking what she's doing for school and making her lunch. She's also taken an interest in music and my boyfriend used to be in a band his teenage years and she's fascinated by that and they spend a lot of time playing the guitar together. So they've gotten pretty close and they are quite fond of each other. As my boyfriend has moved in, we've taken to redecorating a bit to make it our space and I put a frame of the three of us (me, daughter, and boyfriend) in the living room. It's a sweet photo of a happy day that we are all fond of. There are other photos around the house with my boyfriend and there's a few of my boyfriend teaching my daughter the guitar, stuff like that. I don't have any photos of my ex around the apartment, but in my daughters room, we've hung photos of her and her Dad (they were always there). My ex and I have a complicated history, but we are now cordial. The other day, when my ex came to pick up our daughter for the weekend, he noticed the changes and the pictures. I didn't really notice until later, but he left kind of mad. He then called me around midnight and ranted to me about how disrespectful it is to have a family-style photo with him not including in any of them and how its going to negatively affect our daughter's relationship with him and that I'm purposefully trying to alienate our daughter from him. Apparently, our daughter also has started talking about my boyfriend a lot in front of her father and that rubbed him the wrong way. He wants me to remove the photos or add a photo with the three of us (him, me and our kid), both requests which I've refused. Am I the asshole?"
224,Not the A-hole,AITA for confronting my friend and calling them racist?,0,m1gpw7,11,"This post is similar to another post I made a few days ago. I'll just reference a bit of what was said for the sake of brevity and need to hear more opinions. I think I am being gaslit in this situation they think my sensitivity is the problem. It is really strange because these people are emotionally available when it comes to my depression and possible BDD, so it is hard to completely hate them. They also claim that they're the only ones allowed to pick on me, but they wouldn't allow someone else to do the same thing?The friends in a Discord chat were telling me to shut up because I was not comfortable with them using the N-word and as an immature way to defend their point, one of them sent in a racist meme that said ""shut up, N-word (hard r)"". Just to preface, they know that I am Black. I am the only person in that group that is Black (background information). Those ""friends"" all reacted to the meme with laughing emojis instead of confronting the person that directed the meme at me. That person pretty much called me the N-word, and I kept telling them that it is racist and unacceptable to say it. ""As long as it is used correctly it can be funny"", one of them said. There were other very insensitive jokes said to me. Because they know I am Muslim and below average in height (only 5'1, whatever), they sent in memes of Sikh men with dwarfism and said ""is this you?"" It really offended me, simply because being Muslim and south Asian are obviously not mutually exclusive. I pretty much made the clarification that the person in the photo was most likely a Sikh, not a Muslim. One of them (who is White, all of them are actually) gets pretty upset with me and thinks I am annoying whenever I correct him because he thinks I am intentionally patronizing him. This is the same guy that has also called me the ""support sex"" because ""women don't need to orgasm to reproduce."" . He also proceeded to say that my game character's skin color is ""dark"", so I confronted him for being racist. He kept trying to tell me ""let it be known I am not racist"", etc etc. They have also called me ""curry muncher"" and ""turban sniffer"", not understanding how ignorant and stereotypical those comments are simply because I'm 1. Black 2. I wear a hijab, not a ""turban"". I am thinking about slowly cutting off contact from them and then blocking them because I am honestly not the best with confrontation and have an anxiety disorder. Emotionally speaking, I am absolutely done with their crap. They have been there for me when I was depressed, but honestly I don't think they respect me that much if they are aware of possibly offending me yet continue to say ignorant things towards me. They have all called me a sensitive snowflake and that it is ""only a joke""  whenever I brought up their ignorant racism. I cannot keep this bottled inside me any longer. AITA?"
225,Not the A-hole,WIBTA For Not Issuing Refund?,25,m0jo1o,19,"I recently sold a vintage acoustic guitar online. It was in pretty rough shape, but still playable (which was made explicit in my post). I mentioned every problem that I was aware of and sold the item in good faith. When the buyer first received it, he left a review saying everything was just as described. Now, three weeks after he’s received it, the buyer has notified me that part of the back of the guitar has separated, and he wants a refund. It’s beyond the website’s return window. He claims that the repair would exceed the cost of the guitar, which isn’t true. Based on my research and having similar repairs done in the past, I think that the repair cost would be about half of the price that he purchased the guitar for. But maybe that’s neither here nor there. I’m sort of torn. On the one hand, I feel bad that he’s having problems with the gear I sold. On the other hand, he took a risk buying a 60 year old guitar online, which I clearly indicated was in rough shape. Also, I don’t know what he’s done with it in the meantime. He could’ve dropped it, or tuned the strings too high, or any number of other things. I needed the money when I sold the guitar. I waited for two weeks, which is the website’s return window, and then spent the money on essentials—times are a bit hard right now. I can’t really afford to give the guy back his money, and, again, I waited until the return window was up to use it.So, would I be the asshole for not issuing a refund?"
226,Not the A-hole,Aita for being pissed at my boyfriend for yelling at me for not turning the lights on because I have a headache and he needs to stay awake?,54,m0f9ca,76,"I've had a headache for hours, I took ibuprofen and slept for a bit but it hurts so badly I woke up and can't fall back asleep. So the bedroom light is off but our closet light is on and it's really bright so I went to turn it off and my boyfriend starts yelling at me. ""Seriously what are you doing? I have an appointment in an hour I need to stay awake. I want to turn the bedroom light too"" and I was like seriously? Are you kidding? Shhh please my head is killing me. Ugh fine, I turn the closest light on. But then he starts complaining that ""I'm selfish"" because I won't turn the light on. But I told him I think he's being selfish, and I shouldn't have to suffer through a headache because he can't stay awake without all the lights being on. He can be responsible and stay awake if he really needs too. I keept putting a blanket over my head because it hurts so badly but it's not helping. He went to sit in the living room and I finally gave up and starting looking at my phone. Sorry for any errors my head is actually throbbing and im on mobile. So am I the asshole?"
227,Not the A-hole,AITA for walking out on dinner with my parents after having an argument?,111,m0bgx0,48,"A few years ago, when I was 20 years old, I was still living at my parents home.After a few months of my girlfriend visiting me on a regular basis and staying over night, they felt annoyed by her presence. They told me they did not have enough privacy anymore, even though for the most part me and my GF were only staying in my room or spent time outside. Sometimes we would make some food in the kitchen but that's it. And it's not like we had loud sex or anything like that. At a certain point my parents told me that my girlfriend could only come by once a week from now on. I got into an argument with them and my mum became angry and basically called my GF a parasite. She said that my GF had creeped her way into living in my room, even though she always returned back to her own home after three or four days.At the time we spend almost the same amount of days at her parents home, but her parents didn‘t mind me spending time there.There was one particularly bad moment where my GF was alone in my room and my mother was raging out about her right in front of the door. She even got my two little brothers to agree with her and say that my GF was annoying.I decided it was time to move out. When I told my mum about the idea of looking for my own flat she told me that I shouldn't do it.In my hometown most landlords reject university students (like me) without a legal paper that ensures that the parents will pay, if the child is unable to. But even with that paper it's very hard to find a flat here as there is a lot of demand and very little supply when it comes to the housing market. Unfortunately my mum did not want to sign the necessary legal paper.A couple of weeks later I found out that a friend of mine personally owned a flat that she was planning to rent out. Therefore I was lucky enough to move out without needing that legal paper. I moved out and me and my GF moved into the new flat together.Years later the relationship between my parents and my GF is still very bad. They completely avoid meeting each other and every time I visit my parents they basically ignore the fact that she even exists. My mother keeps making suggestions that I should spend a year abroad or move to another city without my GF and it often feels like she secretly wants us to break up.Today I went over to my parents home in order to have dinner with them and for some reason this old argument was revitalised. My mother still insists that my GF was a parasite at that time. She also claims that she herself didn't behave in a bad way and still blames my GF for everything. I shouted at her for still talking about my GF that way. Until at a certain point I just left.I feel very bad for my little brothers and my dad, who had to witness this fight. I think I could have done a much better job at handling the situation. The sad thing is, I kinda feel like I broke up with my family today and that hurts. I don't want to lose my relationship with them but I also don't want to live a double live between my family and my girlfriend."

I ended up finding out that my money was taken I asked him and he acted dumb he and my mum were the only ones who knew where I had hidden it and my mum went out that day. So I was having a convo with my family and my Dad's lies were brought up so I decided I should maybe I should confront him so here I am.WIBTA if I told my dad to give me back my money.
229,Not the A-hole,AITA for not accepting my boyfriends friends apology?,1134,lzy90w,97,"Vague title, I know, bare with me! My (23f) boyfriends (25m) best friend (who I will call S) has been staying with us for a while, I work a lot as does he so we don’t hang out especially often. The first incident that caused upset was a few weeks ago.It was my day off and I wanted to feel nice, got dressed in the morning in clothes I was happy and confident in. Stressful times can be eased by the simplest of solutions. I decide to go outside to smoke and S joins me. We chat and I mention that that morning I’d received an unusually crass comment when I was at the cash point and how it had really bummed me out as I was feeling confident beforehand. He stares at my chest for an extended period of time, unabashedly) and tells me that its to be expected if I’m wearing what I'm wearing in this area.That upset me but I remained quiet, I checked my phone and he’s commented drooling emojis on my instagram photo in that outfit. I think maybe he’s just uncomfortable or not aware of what that would regularly mean. I mention it to my boyfriend and he comments on how weird it was and we moved on.A few days later, S has his girlfriend over who I love to pieces. Drinks are consumed, more so by others than me but I’m enjoying the vibe and everything. Midnight rolls around and I go to pee, my boyfriend then lets the other two know that its now my dads birthday (who died last year) and not mention it but be wary I might be a bit down. I come back unaware that this conversation has happened and his girlfriend and I continue to chat. It came up organically and we had a really lovely conversation about it. This was the first time I’d told her some of the more unpleasant parts about my dads death and I got quite sad. S had been listening the whole time and looks at me deadpan and says “Oh so thats why you have massive daddy issues”. I told him that wasn’t acceptable and excused myself to go to the bathroom. My boyfriend told him to apologise which S said he didn’t feel was necessary. Regardless he gave me a very lacklustre apology. Think along the lines of “I'm sorry you got upset”.Well I was extremely hurt by this and my boyfriend was also pretty angry. Probably the angriest I’ve seen him for a while. S has moved out to his new place now (unrelated to this argument) and I’ve not spoken to him since, he’s expressed his want to apologise and I’ve obviously told my boyfriend that he is 100% allowed to forgive him FOR him but I don’t want to forgive him. Bf can chill with him whenever but I just don’t want to hang with him anymore. I do feel guilty for holding a grudge about it but it did really hurt me.S said that me not speaking to him has caused him anxiety so I am starting to feel guilty about not wanting to and I don't want to put my bf in an awkward position. I just don’t enjoy his company anymore and instances like this have increased recently towards me.So reddit, AITA?"
230,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking to share antivirus expenses?,4,m0w8iy,19,"I (21F) asked my brother (19M) for a little bit of money toward the yearly antivirus costs. It’s $120 a year, and with me being a college student on minimum wage, it always hits me decently hard at the time because they charge it all at once. Every member of my family has been given the login and has the program on their computer, but only because I have shared it with them— they don’t get pushy, I’ve just offered because I have to pay for it anyway. It’s continued where I foot the bill for about 4 years now. This time around, though, I asked for some funds toward it from my mother (44F) and aforementioned brother, as they are both adults with income also. My brother sent me $30, but my mom wasn’t so willing. She felt that it was cheap to offer it and then ask for money for it. I understand where she’s coming from, but I want to know if I was in the wrong here. Thanks!"
231,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I told my sister what my cousin said about her daughter?,189,m08o6g,26,"My sister has a daughter (8F) she has a mild form of Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome. It doesn’t effect her much other than she’s bigger than a lot of kids in her class, she has to get regular ultrasounds to check her organs, and she has a little speech impediment! She is my favorite person on the planet, she is kind, smart, and has a bold personality. I helped my sister by nannying for her when my niece was born till she was 9 months, so she’s super important to me and she acts like I’m her second mom. I was talking to my cousin (37M) earlier today, and he’s been dating a girl for maybe two years. She has a daughter who is 10. He kept going on and on about how smart their kid is and how she’s so much smarter and on another league than my niece. And how my niece should learn how to talk properly at her age. I literally was seeing red. My niece is not stupid, she can read, write, spell, do basic math, tell time. Her teachers always say how kind and smart she is. She just has trouble speaking from the syndrome she has. It doesn’t effect her mental capacity at all. I don’t know if I should say something to my sister about it, or if I should just let it go. WIBTA if I told her? TLDR: My niece has a speech impediment, and my cousin was was acting like she’s not smart because of it. I don’t know if I should tell my sister."
232,Not the A-hole,AITA? Can't Sleep When Being Poked,155,m09otx,74,"Hey everyone. I've been creeping on this sub for awhile now and want some input. This is probably a little TMI, so I'm sorry.Myself (25f) and my fiancé (24m) have been together for two and half years and have been engaged since November 2020. We've been living together since May 2019. Obviously we share a bed. I'm a light sleeper and my biggest thing is being woken up when I'm touched.My fiancé is very touch-feely, and we both enjoy cuddling. However, I'm always woken up by the night-time boner many men seem to get. I understand it's an unconscious thing that happens during sleep, but it wakes me up and it's hard for me to fall back asleep after being woken, especially with something poking me in the back. I started putting some of the blankets between us (pulled down over us, so not a lump of extra blankets), that way we are cuddling but there is a small barrier between us. I'm able to fall back asleep, and the cuddling gets to continue.I woke up a couple days ago and he told me he was really hurt by this and it hurt his feelings a lot by me putting the blankets between us while we slept. I explained the issue and he understood my point of view, however he was still hurt. AITA?I think IATA because I do something that is hurting my fiancés feelings, for the sake of my own comfort."
233,Not the A-hole,AITA for giving my best friend of six years my last will and testament to hold onto instead of my parents?,239,m0756m,45,"Okay, little context. I work in a very dangerous industry, one where I am at risk of either serious bodily injury or death every single day. I don't want to name the field I'm in because it could reveal my identity and I'm not into that. Let's just say it's tied to the aviation industry. So because my job constantly has me at risk, I have a written will, like most folks. I'm 25 btw, but the nature of my job makes not having one a very bad idea. In addition to the will, I have written a letter to my best friend to be opened only if something happens to me. He holds onto both for me. I had to take him an updated copy of my will so I had it in my car to take to him on the way to work. My dad (who I currently live with due to some money constraints I don't want to get into) needed to move my car. So he used my keys to move it and he found the letter. To be clear, the issue isn't that my dad moved the car. That's totally fine. He's got places to go and I wasn't home so whatever. To his credit, he didn't open the envelope, but he was curious. It had my best friends name on it. In addition to having a personal letter to my best friend, I also had a few other letters for other people too in there for him to distribute in the case of my demise. When I got home, he asked me about it. I explained to him what it was and he was furious. He yelled at me and asked me why I didn't have him hold onto the letters instead of my best friend. I told him that the letter was personal and between me and my best friend and to please stay out of it and that he's been holding onto this stuff for at least two years already and that these where updated documents. He was so angry he left the room and hasn't talked me. My best friend feels terrible about it, it's not his fault. But I feel bad, maybe I was the asshole here but I just don't know. The reason he was holding onto them in the first place was I didn't think I could trust my dad not to open my letters to other people in my life that are important to me because of previous experiences. So, I just don't know. AITA?"
234,Not the A-hole,AITA for snapping at a masseuse and basically getting her in trouble?,1379,lzwexd,247,"Background: -I have back problems and need to either go to the chiropractor or a deep massage every two months or so.-My left arm has a bunch of sh scars with one being pretty big. I keep the big one covered with special tape so it doesn’t show as much. Also, the tape is basically liquid prof and I don’t have to remove it to shower, apply lotion or anything of the sort.-I live in a Latin countryOkay into the story, I hadn’t gotten a treatment in about seven months due to COVID shutting down spas and my go-to chiropractor deciding he wasn’t working until this whole thing was over. This obviously put me in a lot of stress and pain to the point that I ended up buying self massagers and a bunch of creams and stuff to help me cope. Last week I finally found a spa that was opening up again and immediately booked an appointment for a deep massage. During the massage everything was going great, I was finally feeling relaxed as the pain slowly went away, until the woman started doing my arms. Like I said, my scars are noticeable. I don’t deny it and I know people will be curious about them. Usually I don’t mind much when strangers try to get a look at my arm or some people even ask to touch them from time to time and although it does make me very uncomfortable but I don’t mention it.This time though, I was in what I expected to be a professional environment where the staff is supposed to make me feel comfortable and relaxed. The lady starts doing my left arm and suddenly I can feel her tense up. (Okay no big deal, she sees them, it’s fine) Now, I do understand and respect the fact that some people might feel uncomfortable or weirded out by my scars and their entitled to that feeling. What I don’t agree with is her tracing her fingers over them, and then proceeding to try and take my tape off. I had previously asked if I had to take it off during the massage and was specifically told that it wasn’t necessary since my comfort was important. When I pulled my arm away and politely asked her to not take my tape off she apologized and went back to the massage. A few second later, she does the same thing of trying to take it off and I, less politely, tell her to please ignore the tape and not try to take it off again. She, again, apologizes and continues the massage. She tries for a third time to take my tape off and I just get up, tell her I’m asking for a different masseuse and leave. Later I found out she got chastised and my massage ended up being free. I told my friends what happened and some immediately told me I was overreacting, that obviously people are going to be curious and I should expect people to want to see under the tape. The other side of my friends are saying that it was totally unprofessional of her to continue trying to take the tape off even after I told her to not do so and I was in my total right to snap and walk away. Now I can’t help but wonder if I overreacted.AITA for snapping at my masseuse and getting her in trouble?Edit: it’s been brought to my attention in the comments that the word ‘masseuse’ has a bad connotation to it and I want to apologize for using it. For some reason Reddit won’t let me change the wording of the original post but I now know to call you guys massage therapists. Sorry about the mix up and thank you for your comments!"
235,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I tell my neighbor's brother to move his car/home off my property?,18,m0lmif,20,"  Our house backs up to an alleyway and then a greenbelt, which is generally nice and private. A couple weeks ago I noticed a car parked in our driveway back there, behind our garage but firmly on our property. **Background**: my neighbor, let's call him the Mechanic, owns at least five vehicles, including a giant RV and trailer which he keeps parked on our residential street despite it being technically illegal and everyone else in the neighborhood hating it. It seems any time he is home, he is in his garage/shop/trailer, blasting music and working on cars. So when I saw a new car parked out back, I assumed he was working on someone's car and moved along. We don't use that drive way, so I didn't want to go out of my way to be a dick about it.After the first few days I was out walking the dogs and ran into the Mechanic's wife. She let me know that actually, the Mechanic's brother who ""prefers a nomadic lifestyle"" is sleeping in his car back there. I was stunned, and the dogs were pulling so I just sort of laughed awkwardly and kept moving. Part of the reason I think I could be the asshole here is that I could and should have been more direct with her, but I was honestly so caught off guard.I work for an affordable housing nonprofit, so I am acutely aware of the homelessness problem in my area. I felt immediately torn. Again, we don’t use that driveway so on the one hand, what’s the harm? On the other hand, it’s our property and we were never asked in advance, which bugs me on principle. My resentment has grown by the day.I’ve reached a boiling point because where the car is parked, it’s also pointed at the windows on the back of our house. AKA, windows into the bedroom where I change/sleep, and the office where I work all day. I’m not a nudist but I do walk around my house in various states of dress (hello, pandemic). Also, my partner is deployed, so I feel extra lonely and uncomfortable knowing some guy I’ve never met is sleeping 20 yards away. I’m not accusing him of being a peeping Tom, but I’ve had too many creepy experiences in my life not to be cautious.Every other day I find myself getting super pissed by the lack of privacy, and the lack of communication and consideration by my neighbor. This is all “on brand” for him tbh, he’s the type of person who thinks he’s hilarious for keeping his RV parked out front even after multiple neighbors have called the City about it. This disposition is why me and my partner have tended to ignore all his other annoying habits, because he seems to thrive on getting a rise out of people and ain’t nobody got the fucking time… generally.**WIBTA if I do approach him and say what I really want to say – that he lacks consideration and respect, and his brother’s car/home need to be gone for good ASAP??** …I really hate playing into gender stereotypes, but this dude is big and loud and makes the sort of sexist jokes you’d hear on a shitty sitcom. I’m a bit nervous about confronting him and possible “payback.”"
236,Not the A-hole,AITA for not getting an emotionally abusive sibling a birthday present?,10,m0r5n7,9,"I have an older brother whose birthday is today and I didn't get him anything at this time, not even a card, mainly because he had been verbally and emotionally abusive towards me and my parents. We're both adults (he's a few years older  than me) and I've tried my best to get along with  things and avoid him as much as I can. He'd be verbally abusive if anyone would say something that'd tick him off unintentionally and escalate the situation. Neither of us have been abused by our parents. My brother doesn't do  drugs, isn't an alcoholic, and as far as I know doesn't have any mental/physical disabilities.Despite being out of college for years now, and previously working outside the USA for a year, he doesn't make any efforts to find work or do anything else during the day but sleep. I currently have a job, but I'm fresh out of college (I got my bachelor's in 2020) and I can't afford to move out.I've admitted and acknowledged that I'm not always in the right, though. I've sometimes jumped to conclusions and unintentionally started an argument over something I contributed to or immediately assumed it was him. But I would never go as far with the way he handles things, or at least try not to. Asking my parents for help doesn't do much, and they both tell my brother and I to ""handle it like adults"", and if it's just him to ""leave him be"". They've even yelled at me or tell me they don't want to hear it if I try to explain what is going on from my side of the story. I feel like they're desensitized to his actions. We've even had officers try to deescalate fights between him and my dad a few times in the past.He and my parents have been treating me awfully the past few weeks (my brother  doing it for a longer time since he came back), and telling me off for swearing when I'm at a boiling point with my frustration. I decided this year I didn't want to get him anything because I feel like he doesn't deserve it. This treatment from my brother has been going on for roughly 10 years now. It's affected me emotionally and mentally. I get anxious with confrontations (even outside of home), I've associated slammed doors at home with him, and trying to be civil doesn't always work well.Am I the asshole here? Don't hold back with the honesty."
237,Not the A-hole,AITA for wanting to tell my sister the truth?,13,m0n63a,23,"So first of all english isnt my first language so i hope you understand what i mean.A little background information before the whole story starts: I never had a good relationship with my mother and i moved out when i was 18 (im 19 now and btw an woman). Ive had my difficulties with her and im struggling from depression, social anxiety and chronic sleep depression(i dont know the correct word for it in english sorry). My whole family kinda broke the contact with my mom since she done and said things that just werent okay, like somethin along the lines of my oldest brother isnt her child anymore and to me she always acted like she never remembers what she said or did to me and its just fucked up.But now to the actual story.I found out about a year ago that my oldest sister has a different father than she believes. (We all thought that my three older siblings had the same father then i had a different father and my younger brother also has a different one) the only ones who know about that secret are my grandparents, my mom, my father and my stepfather and me  aswell as the now deceased man my sister thinks is her father. Everyone wants to keep shut about the secret cause they dont want the family break up about something like this. Which i totally understand. But still i think my sister deserves to know the truth since i was 11 when i found out who my real father was and kinda know what it feels like to been lied to.But now shes 29 and everyone thinks shes gonna fall into a hole and maybe even kills herself which we dont know for sure but everyone is treating her like shes gonna jump infront of a train right know and im kinda asking myself if they dont overreact simply over the fact that they want to hide the truth. I mean they dont even care about me jumping in front of a train even though i already told them i had such thoughts. But that doesnt belong right here now.So everyone tells me i should just shut up or atleast dont tell her that they all known for like almost her whole life but i just dont know.So AITA for thinking about telling my sister the truth about her father even though my family doesnt want that?Feel free to ask me more questions if it is to confusing cause i dont really know how to explain it so it isnt confusingAnd sorry the text is sooo long"
238,Not the A-hole,AITA for lashing out at my roommates for making fun of my underwear,13,m0nhf5,10,"So I live with three other roommates who I’ve lived with for about three years now. We are all male between the age 21-23 and I would say we are all really close.It has never been an issue walking around without clothes. We live in a really hot and humid area and especially in the summer we walk around in boxers a lot or without shirts. It’s not something that we ever really talked about or set any defined boundaries we just do it. I recently switched from boxer brief underwear to the regular brief underwear (like tidy whities basically) bc I run/work out more and just think they’re more comfortable. They definitely took notice right away and anytime I’m walking around in them or they’re seen it can range from jokes about the appearance/my sexuality/ or even wedgies that go as far as literally ripping them ..Some of it is really whatever .. I kind of expected jokes and comments but it became a problem yesterday when we were with a group of girls that we are close with and hang out with a lot. The context for the convo isn’t necessarily important but one of my roommates flat out said “ask (me), he basically wears thongs.” It started a whole detailed conversation specifically about my underwear and just about all my roommates chimed in adding anything from “they’re basically diapers” and “he still wears whitey tighties”. I didn’t really engage in the conversation but it was really humiliating having my underwear be a topic of conversation around women that I am close with but am not romantically/sexually involved with. When they had left and I was just with my roommates I lashed out at them and called them all bullies for not just their mean comments but even bringing up something private like that to others in the first place. I told them I didn’t like that my underwear was even a topic of conversation in general and that it shouldn’t be a big deal what I wear. They basically put it back on me and said that they were all just joking and it sounded like I was just insecure about my choice of underwear. I haven’t really spoken to any of them since and I feel like they could at least apologize for making me uncomfortable but I’m starting to think maybe I am overreacting and if they’re right. AITA?"
239,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my friends to do school work,5,m0uzfe,10,Me (16f) and my friend(16f)  are working together in a group project that makes up a lot of our grade and is really important.We started this three weeks ago and since then she hasn't done any work even though I called her multiple times and asked them in person and she always said that she would do it and then end up not doing it and i ended doing most of it but there are some parts where we have to do it individually.I know that she might be struggling to adjust to being on zoom and keeping up with school work so  I don't want to pressure her too much but it's a really important assignment.I think that she might be mad at me because I'm constantly asking her to finish the work but it's very frustrating because this affects my grade as well. I don't think that I can tell a teacher about this because i already feel pretty guilty for asking her to finish the work many times to the point where I feel sick when I think about it. She's one of my best friends and I don't want to ruin our friendship. Aita for asking them to do the school work?Edit 1: more info
240,Not the A-hole,AITA for eating my dad’s ice cream,7,m0q59q,45,"My (f17) dad has a bit of an ice cream obsession. We have an old refrigerator and freezer in the garage and the garage freezer is full with like 7 different kinds of ice cream. My sisters (18, 15, 13) and mom are all lactose intolerant so they can’t eat it and I’m not a huge fan of ice cream so I rarely have any. Yesterday I was really craving an ice cream sandwich so I went to the garage and grabbed one out of the garage and I thought it wasn’t a big deal. He had 2 boxes of those ice cream sandwiches (6 or 7 in each box so there were either 11 or 13 ice cream sandwiches left) so I really didn’t think it would make a dent. When he got home from work he went to the freezer to grab an ice cream and saw that I opened the box of ice cream sandwiches. He came in my room and seemed really upset and asked why I touched his ice cream. I thought he was joking at first because it’s a freaking ice cream sandwich but he was dead serious. I told him I wanted an ice cream sandwich and it’s no big deal because he still has a lot left. He told me he doesn’t want me touching his stuff anymore and that if I want ice cream I have get a job and buy it myself and he seemed pretty mad.Again, it’s freaking ice cream. I took 1 out of 12/14 sandwiches and I eat them like 1-2 times a year. So I wanted to know if I’m really an asshole for taking an ice cream sandwich"
241,Not the A-hole,AITA for lying to my carpool?,49,m0dwew,22,"English is not my first languageThis happened a few years ago but it popped up in a conversation a few days ago and I've been thinking about itAt the time I was 20F. I would regularly travel between Germany and France and I would usually take carpools. The reservation was made using a website that I expect a lot of Europeans to know, and which made the carpoolee pay beforehand, thus insuring that the carpooler would get pay afterwards without having to physically exchange money. The carpool I had booked was more expensive than usual.I met my carpool, also 20F. She was a student and her car was kinda rubbish, dirty and clearly not in a good shape. Some parts of the inside of the door were fixed with scotch tape. I didn't mind she was a student and needed money, I was a student and needed a car. She was friendly, we talked a lot.Everything was fine until we crossed the Swiss border. A heavy rain started to fall, and she couldn't get her windshield wiper to work. She told me that it was her first long trip with the car. I started to worry a bit, because we were on the highway and the visibility was non-existent. Then, we started going slower and slower until the car broke down. We waited a bit and were able to start it again. Both of us were anxious at this point. We ended up findind a reste area where I was able to communicate enough (I spoke a bit of german, she did not) to find help, and after 5 hours of shenanigans, we were able to resume our travel. Still, no windshield wipers. Still, the rain.At the time, I lived in a city known for having a lot of crime. I lived in an isolated student's home, I had to walk 30 minutes of slope in a patch of the city with a lot of theft and rackett, and my luggage was heavy. If we had been only 3 hours late, I would have been able to safely catch a bus, but it was then 11 PM. I asked her if she would accept to drop me off there, with the car it would only take her like 15 minutes, and she said no. She had been very friendly before, so I started negociating. I had 5 € in cash with me, and told her I would pay her if she dropped me off. She said no. 10 €, still no. 15, she accepted.When she dropped me off, I told her I had lied about paying her more. She insulted me. I told her the carpool was already expensive for the state of the coffin with wheels she called her car. We argued for a bit then she left. Honestly I would have given her the 5 € if she had accepted.Here's the thing I did lie to her, but at the same time I feel like it was her responsability to take care of her car if she was to invite someone in. On the highway with no wipers, I legit thought we were gonna die. I feel like it was entirely her fault if we were late and I couldn't catch a bus. But at the same time, I could absolutely have found an ATM to pay her, even if I would have ended up paying the same amount that I would have for a train. I've been told that it was the risk of the carpool thing. AITA?"

243,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting upset that my FIL wants to put the cats outside in his own home.,14,m0l3ti,33,"My husband and I stay with my in laws. This is at their request. We've brought up moving out several times but they aren't interested. For the most part this works out just fine. We don't get in each other's way most times. This is unfortunately one of those times where we are disagreeing. First some back story. Hubby and I took a big leap before we got married and decided to get a pet. We asked his parents and they were fine with it. The cat was our responsibility and an overall sweetheart. She loved going outside, and we didn't mind. We'd leave a window open for her, she had a collar and was chipped. She was really good at coming back at set times and for the most part she was home more than outside she just enjoyed being able to go out when she wanted. She was a rescue and her previous owners basically kicked her out the house all day so we felt it would be cruel to suddenly take it all away from her. We had her all of a year before we found her in the street just outside our house having been hit by a car. We were devastated but accepted that because we allowed her outside, then we were partially at fault.Two years later and MIL asked us if we wanted to get a new cat. I admitted that only if it were a small kitten so that we could raise it to be an inside cat. MIL and FIL understood and pushed for the cat because we had begun talks of moving again. So after discussing it, we decided to get a rescue kitten. Upon going to the rescue we couldn't decide and ended up getting two sweet little babies, with permission first. They're four months old now, and are completely housebound. FIL had been complaining about the litterboxes smell as our previous cat used the garden. I agreed the smell was unpleasant but only after they just pooped and we cleaned them twice a day so overall manageable. He wants to start introducing them to the garden and I've repeatedly reminded him that they are meant to be inside cats. Tonight he moved one of the boxes outside, talking about how they can start using that one and I again reminded him, this time, more harshly than before, that you can't have a cat go outside and not be curious to see more and ultimately we can't stop them if we give them a taste of a whole new world to explore. We can't then stop them if they decide to go further and get hit by a car like the last cat. The street by our house is known for crazy driving.He's now sulking in the kitchen and my husband thinks I should just let it go and not be so harsh about it. It is their house ultimately. I just feel that unless there's a resolution we're likely to move out and we know that they don't want us to. I also know where all the cat friendly apartments are in the area but my husband thinks that bringing up moving if the smell is that bothersome would actually make things worse given how much they don't want us to leave."
244,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my sister to not use my soap anymore?,16,m0juta,34,"I (F18) currently live with my sister (15) and my dad (46). I am hopefully going to move out soon with my SO. I buy myself my skincare, body wash, toothbrushes, etc. with the help of my boyfriend. I keep it in the bathroom cabinets because it’s easier compared to having to keep it in a bag and then carry it to and back to my room. My dad doesn’t buy me that stuff or anything. However, here is when the problem comes in. My sister keeps using my body soap. I don’t even know how many times this has happened but it’s been happening since I started providing for myself a year ago. At first, it started with my skincare stuff and while it made me a bit upset, I didn’t know who was using it. Then, it went to my soap and my sugar scrub and I asked my sister about it. That’s when she told me she was using it. She apologized, but hasn’t tried to improve. To be completely transparent, I have done something like this before but, I apologized and stopped. She does this mostly in the mornings before school but even then, I told her to just ask me the night before. This is where I might be the asshole: my sister thinks she might be on the spectrum. From my knowledge, it’s because she has a friend who is autistic and told them that they show signs of it. If you don’t know, autism is very hard to detect in girls/women, so getting a diagnosis is a long and difficult process. I don’t exactly know what the signs are, but apparently she hyper fixates a lot, has a “different way of thinking”, and tends to talk over me a lot in conversation. I have been trying to be understanding, but every time I tell her that she needs to ask, she always gets really defensive and will sometimes go into a full blown panic attack because she can’t really handle criticism as well as blame me for not understanding that she has a “different way of thinking” and is forgetful. I obviously don’t want to be ableist, but there has to be some sort of self-awareness in doing this if she keeps doing it and doesn’t tell me until I confront her, right? My dad can buy her the soap I use since it’s only $5. I have told my dad to buy her own body wash so then this issue doesn’t happen again. It just feels like I’ve done everything to try and prevent this from happening.I’m going to start hiding it in my room at this point. I’m tired of being disrespected like this and then somehow getting blamed because she has a different way of thinking. I’ve asked and begged so many times for her to just ask and I will more than likely say yes, but I always end up feeling like the asshole whenever I confront her about it. So, reddit, AITA?TDLR: My sister keeps using my body wash after repeatedly being told to ask and I don’t know if I’m the asshole for confronting her about it because she might be on the spectrum."
245,Not the A-hole,AITA - partner & rent,16,m0jol4,87,"So, bit of background (apologies it’s long!) My partner and I have been together for over two years. Nine months into our relationship we decided to move in together. His house was bigger than mine so I rented mine out. The rent covers my mortgage and the agency fees but doesn’t leave any funds for ongoing maintenance and I fund this myself. He earns a lot more than me, my monthly salary after tax, etc. is about £1.5k whilst his is over £6k. When I first moved in we agreed I would pay £500 a month to contribute. I’ve really struggled to save whilst paying this amount as after the “rent”, my own bills and cost of living, there isn’t a lot left. After 12 months I said I wanted to have a look at the rent and see if we could sort something out. My plan was that I would pay for 50% of the household bills, council tax, etc. and then put the rest of the £500 into a savings account that we could use in the future when we look to buy a house.He got very angry at this suggestion and said that I was placing no value on living in his house at all. I said I was and regularly contribute (I’ve bought plants for the garden, decor bits, painted, clean and help out as much as I can) but don’t think that I should be paying for his mortgage as I’ve got no security in his house and am paying my own. He said that the money I gave him wasn’t paying the mortgage but was used by him to spend as he wanted. This upset me as I don’t think I’m there to fund his lifestyle. He does earn more than me so I know he will be able to treat himself more than I can, but for him to be buying designer clothes, fancy tech gadgets, etc. essentially with my money doesn’t feel very nice to me. He has said that I am a freeloader and being incredibly rude and spoilt and that his friends/family agree with him but obviously not sure how the story has been told. Just wondered what your guys thoughts were? AITA?"
246,Not the A-hole,AITA for forgetting my friend's birthday?,5,m0vbsh,39,"I'll keep this shortSo my friend's birthday was last week, which I forgot because there were so many tests that I had to take, and most of them are topics which I don't really know of, so I studied every day while taking 2 hours on every subject. Because of all the stress I forgot my friend's birthday. When my friend found out she was upset, and messaged me saying that I had forgot her birthday. But the thing is, that she messaged me this on a group chat, so obviously my other mutual friends were dragging me for forgetting her birthday. She tried to tell them to stop, but then won't. And now I am thinking if I'm a bad friend.AITA for forgetting my friend's birthday?"
247,Not the A-hole,AITA for wanting to change my name,10,m0ncac,15,So my grandfather (he’s not my biological grandfather) he named me Jasmine lee-Ann *last name and passed away when I was six. So when I was 13 I came out as nonbinary and would like to be called rayan since it a name that can be used with male and female and I was told that it’s disrespectful to my dead grandfather and no one in my family will call me that. So I’m asking Reddit am I the asshole
248,Not the A-hole,AITA for ignoring my gf's request for me to come by immediately?,2266,lzq9se,283,"I (26m) have been seeing this girl (25f) since Jan. She and I are part of the same circle of friends so we weren't complete strangers. This happened only this morning.Quite a number of male friends and I meet and play football (or soccer) regularly on Saturday mornings. We have been very consistent with it since December and I've come to look forward to it ever since. Yesterday morning we couldn't play because it rained heavily and we decided over WhatsApp to play this morning instead (Sunday). My gf and I don't live together but yesterday, when I went over after the rain stopped, I told her we'd decided to play the next morning instead (i.e this morning).This morning (~ 9 am) while we were in the middle of a match with some other group of guys, she called me because she'd received a visit from a few friends whom she'd told about me and asked that I come over immediately because her friends wanted to meet me (She lives an hour from the park where we play). I told her I'd be over as soon as the match ended, within a half-hour. She said nothing and ended the call.After the match ended, I immediately showered and went to her place. I even skipped the breakfast we usually have together immediately after the game ends. When I got there her friends had already left and she gave me the silent treatment. I apologised and offered to invite her and her friends to lunch in town. She still ignored me and I that annoyed me. I told her I don't know exactly why she's mad at me but when she's ready to act her age and use words to explain how she's feeling, she knows how to reach me. I also added the lunch offer still stood until 2:30 pm when I have to go visit my brother and his wife.AITA? Was I wrong to not go over immediately? Was my behaviour after in anyway A-holish?Edit: I've been reading every single comment here and I have to say there were eye opening. There's clearly a lot I need to reconsider. I'll keep reading the comments and threads."
249,Not the A-hole,AITA for not sending my friend my work?,32,m0eak8,18,"I'm in college (UK) studying engineering, and every time we get a new assignment my friend asks for my work, every single time, i mean he's a nice guy, but he's not the brightest person out there. We are doing a maths module at the moment, and he really needs to pass this module to get in to university, but he's hopeless.I'm fed up of sending him my work, I'm literally carrying him to university, so am i the asshole if i stop sensing him my work?"
250,Not the A-hole,WIBTA: Evil Boss to Babysitter,8,m0oh8u,31,"I got a new babysitter who I hired 5x/wk but she’s always absent every Monday, she’s been with us for 3wks and she missed 3 Mondays too. All for different reasons I don’t know if I’m going to believe. I’m not deducting her salary coz she asked if she can be paid in advance which I did give coz she seems nice. I’m not reacting from her previous misses coz I’m still giving her benefit of the doubt but it’s been 3 consecutive Mondays and she’s not even informing me. She messaged my Mom if she can ask me to give her another payout. I’m annoyed now, not sure if reprimanding her will make me the evil boss. Help I’m not good with people. I’m always misunderstood I don’t want the lady taking care of my baby hate me coz it might reflect on how she cares for him. But this has to stop."
251,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing my mother's money,11,m0liv3,22,"So, long story short, I've been completely financially independent since 17. My brother (25M) has been completely financially dependent on my mother. She pays his rent, bills, etc and has since birth despite the fact he makes more than she does and twice as much as me. I've fallen on hard times and have quite a bit of medical and credit card debt I cannot pay. Not to mention, I took out cost of living loans in college whilst working that'll come due when I lose my job. In June, I will become homeless until my grad school loans come in. I have nowhere to go. No safety net. It's only two months and it is what it is. My mother has offered to loan me some money for debt, but I feel as if it's too little too late. I don't want her to feel as if the rift is healed, because it isn't. It goes deeper than money for me and she's using it to feel better about the discrepancy in $30k that she has provided my brother over the years. I'm particularly hurt because she has made a single effort to see me since January despite visiting my city weekly, but pines for my brother's attention and makes a point to see him every week. I've had a significant injury in the past few weeks and she's told me to get over it. She refers to him as her family while she refers to me by my name. My aunt is saying I'm an asshole and it doesn't matter. She says I'm in such a tight spot, I can't really refuse. She's saying I can't be mad at my mom if I don't take the money, because my mom's offered and I've refused. AITA?"
252,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for telling my mom I don't want to go on a trip with her?,5,m0peoh,11,"So I (19f) have been doing remote college from home for about a year now with my sister (16f) and mom (48f).  We are on some waitlists for the covid vaccine and will likely get it soon.  Also, for the past year we have been following all social distancing guidelines.  My mom has been talking a lot about traveling once we get the vaccine, saying many of her friends are planning to travel as well (they have been vaccinated).  Usually when the three of us go on trips, it is mostly about what my mom wants to do and there tends to be a lot of tension by the end of the trip, especially between my mom and I.  This results in a lot of unnecessary stress for me, but I am forced to smile about it.  I also feel bad that it feels like my mom is ""wasting"" money on a trip/me if we won't all enjoy it.  There has also been tension at home, since we've been cooped up in the house together for a year now.  I love her of course, but I don't really want to spend more time with her, even if it's in a different zip code.  If traveling is possible, which I'm not sure it is just yet/I am comfortable with it, I would rather spread my wings and go on a trip with my friends.  I know this is selfish thinking, but I feel that I have to seize more opportunities and be a bit more assertive in what I want to or do not want to do once we have more flexibility in regards to traveling/the pandemic.Regardless of covid, this is something I've been contemplating on for years, and I would like to know your opinions in general.  I understand that this isn't the biggest deal in the world and that I am very fortunate, but I would love some advice on how to let my mom know about my feelings in a caring manner, if I should just say nothing, etc.."
253,Not the A-hole,AITA for bringing my children near my brother even if I wouldn’t help him have kids ?,1100,lztvc6,286,"I (32f) have two kids, aged 12 and 10. My brother (28m) has spent lots of time with them obviously as we’re family.  My brother and his husband have been looking into having children  and he asked for some of my eggs as his husband has no one to turn to for that. Now I don’t know much about that but I do know that it’s quite the efforts to get them. So I declined and he seemed to accept that.  However when we were all present together I made a couple comments to my children about how much they looked like me, you know “you’ve got my eyes” and stuff like that.Well my brother was apparently so irate that I had done this that our sister noticed and she eventually informed me that he felt I was an ass for doing that in front of him.My sister agreed with him, I told her then she could give her eggs. But she said that she declined just like me and that wasn’t actually the issue, the issue being that I highlighted a benefit of having a child biologically related to him. I countered there was no way I could’ve know that would be a problem, she said that I wasn’t an idiot and if our brother sought my eggs then clearly he had some wish for a biological child and it didn’t take a genius to figure out that you probably shouldn’t bring up how similar your kids look like to you.But i think that’s an unreasonable idea, am I the ass ?"
254,Not the A-hole,AITA?? Roommate problems,9,m0l0v6,20,"I walked out to see that my car had been broken into this morning. Like my steering column was totally taken off and a bunch of my stuff was gone. My roommate’s sister has been visiting for the past 2 weeks, causing us to have 5 cars in our driveway and making me have to basically park in the street because I leave for work the earliest. I texted both of my roommates in our group chat once I got to work, asking how long my roommate’s sister would be staying and if it was for much longer, if we could figure something out about the driveway situation. I said that I really don’t like having to park in the very back and waking up to find that someone has gone through my car. I didn’t think it was a super big deal, I just wanted to find a solution.My roommate texted me back and said that her car has been gone through quite a few times when SHE has been the one having to park in the back, which made me feel like my issue was being invalidated. She said that her sister had felt very unwelcome this trip, and that she would be putting her up in an Airbnb next time if this was what it was going to come to, and that no one likes to feel unwelcome. I have absolutely no idea how I could have made her sister feel unwelcome. I got exposed to COVID and was home from work for most of the last week, so I was a little bored and cranky, but I think I should have a right to be a little cranky in my own home and in no way do I think I took anything out on her sister. We live in a 2 bedroom house with no spare room, so my roommates (they are bf&gf) share a room and I have the other one. My roommate’s sister sleeps on the couch when she is visiting, which admittedly does get a little tight and frustrating at times. I just deal with it and the only thing I’ve ever brought up is the car thing. I feel like I can’t bring anything up now without it totally being blown out of proportion. AITA?"
255,Not the A-hole,AITA?? i just miss my privacy.,13,m0idqm,17,"My cousin lives with me and has for some time now, i can think since 2020 but i cant pin point when but i know its been around a year now. When they first moved in they said they just wanted to get back on their feet and maybe move to their grandma's on their land of reserve but he did express how it would be wack since we couldnt hang. So i said fuck it and let him stay, chill, and smoke weed and this went on for awhile and i understood kinda since they said they wanted to live the rest of their teen years before they turn 20 so i was like 'sure okay'. But ever since they turned 20 they havent seemed to be finding a job and when i ask them about it they tell me ""i dont know what to do, where to go, or what to say"" and i tell them, ""dude, its okay, my dad and i wanna help you and help you find a job, just think about where you might wanna work"". I got an ""i guess"" but whenever else i bring up getting a job i always get this fuckin vibe that im unwelcomed and i mean i shouldnt feel this way. Its my house and my room hes set up in. I feel like i should be entitled to my room because it's my room and not his, if it was his room i would respect it more and treat it more like theirs and not like i moved in and this half is mine. Anyways i just asked him ""hey dude, do you think you could please set up shop somewhere else in the house tonight? I really dont wanna be a dick and im just asking nicely"" and i got a nasty sigh of a response. I tell myself i shouldnt feel bad and this gives him incentive to find a job and I don't want this, i want him to get a job, i want to be proud of him instead of just watching yt, playing games all day, and smoking the weed my father had handed down to me. I also just want my own privacy and my own room to myself because it gets so damn frustrating and uncomfortable always sharing a room like that.The only other reason i can think why he might be upset is because i accidentally busted his/grinder teeth/my grinder screen when i was trynna extract kief from sifting shake/trim. I hit it with a hammer and it dented the metal but i was just trying to get some kief.I really dont wanna make him feel unwelcomed but i feel like its my only option to give them motivation and i just wanna help him but it gets frustrating when it feels like im the only one trying and they are not.I just wanna live my own life and be in my own room without someone else there all the time, taking my resources, and not providing a lot if anything in return. I care about them but i believe its time for them to grow up but Idk how to say that to them without coming off as dick."
256,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving a game after the dm didn't want to listen to us?,6,m0r8a0,23,"this is going to be a little bit of a different AITA post so bear with me.my friends and I have been playing a DND game that is based off of ice wind dale, in the beginning I played with them but I got burnt out so I dropped out until I was in a better place, in that time my husband who was still in the game told me about things that were going on in the game. things seemed fine and I jumped back in after Tasha's came out.so in the time that I was gone one of the people in there was a druid/warlock but the dm made her just play the warlock and basically threw out the characters backstory well she had befriended a few creatures a mammoth and a skeleton horse. well when i got back they only had the mammoth, we went into this cave to get some wine to save this character. we did the thing and left only to find that the mammoth had run off because we hadn't fed it for two days. the person who owned the mammoth was upset but we just went on.while we were in the cave me and my husbands character found a weird fruit that gave us some health when we ate it, well it gave my husband lycanthropy. so we were trying to find a cure for him and our DM made it clear that this was important and if we didn't get this cured it would probably bad for our characters so we went to find someone who could do remove curse. we get to the first placed that we know there's a guy who can fix it and he's out of town at the time. so we leave and try to find someone in town, it just happened that a ship captain that we knew was there and knew remove curse.so that were it had ended, on the outside of game we had already had a talk with him on a few things like not letting us know things about our characters, not giving us a chance to role play and many many more things. in this talk he turned things back on us and basically said that this was us not telling him. we agreed to talk with him more, this happened just after the mammoth issue.well while we were heading to find the cure the character that had the mammoth found a small white owl bear and made friends with it. well she got a bad roll on animal handling, i think it was a 10 so not horrible. well the bear walked off without anyone noticing it, we all got a bit upset but just let it go. after that we had another talk with him but things didn't change still so as a group we talked it over and voted that we would drop the game.that night his older sister who is part of our group told him and we didn't hear anything back from him for a day but he did delete the server it was on and leave the campaign that the girl with the mammoth had started. when he did respond he basically told us that the player with the owl bear was just butt hurt and that we didn't give him much on our backstories and that he felt that we should have talked to him again before we had dropped.so I bring this to you Reddit, AWTA for not having a third talk with him after the issue and dropping or do you think he's being a dickTLDR DM doesn't take what we want for fun into the game and blames us for not liking the game he put on of us "
257,Not the A-hole,AITA For calling my sister a dog hoarder?,7,m0phoy,12,"My (35F) little sister (27F) has fourteen dogs. They're all rescues, picks them up off the side of the road type. I love how much she's doing for these animals, but they are completely controlling her life. Her boyfriend left her because of them, she has almost zero friends because she never has the energy to keep contact, she has absolutely no funds to use for herself and we can never see her unless we go to her house because she can't leave them. She's kind of estranged from our family now, as we see her so little. Everyone has tried to convince her to give some up, they're really amazing dogs who would find a home instantly. Hell, we've even offered to take a dog off her hands, so it's staying in the family. She always denies us, saying she'll never abandon them like their previous owners. At this point I've stopped trying. She does work with rescues, and gets many dogs rehomed (if the dogs don't work with her pack she obviously can't keep them through risk of dog fights) and even the rescues have asked her to sign some dogs over. Still, she refuses. The other day I was visiting my mother, helping her out with things at home, and she mentioned getting myself and all my siblings together for her birthday next year. I, sarcastically, replied, ""Oh, don't bother asking the dog hoarder, you know she won't say yes.""My mom laughed it off, agreeing, but my husband thought we were being rude. I apologized to him over it, but basically said it was the truth. He's now told my brother in law (a sister's husband, who was my husband's friend before we were married), who proceeded to tell his wife, who told everyone else. It's since blown out if proportion, and my younger sister found out. She mostly laughed it off and said she wouldn't come, especially not now, but said no harsh feelings. My husband is still extremely upset and thinks I need to apologize. AITA?"
258,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I (F20) asked my SO (M21) to pay rent or stop living in my apartment?,596,lzwnpe,152,"Some background, my boyfriend and I have been together for about 4.5 years. We don’t argue much, and we’re genuinely very happy together. I love him and I want to remedy the situation as nicely as possible. I moved out around 6 months ago and since about 2~ months ago he’s essentially been here 24/7. I work, he does not. I have had to ask him to clean up and make the house look nice while I’m gone, because I don’t want to set a precedent. I deal with mental illness and taking care of my home and working full time is still something I’m learning to balance, I don’t need more work at home you know. Well anyways, I took three weeks off of work for my mental health. I was in a horrible place and just needed to reset. Of course it means I’m horribly broke, but I paid my rent and bought gas and groceries so I’m ok for now, I’m more worried about next month. Mind you I’ve had no offers for help, I’ve sent him more money in the past couple months. Would it be obnoxious to ask for help with the rent? It’s $250, I can work side jobs to pay it but I know he has money and he has been here all of February. Info: he buys groceries for himself, but his parents usually pay him back for that too, I have to eat a bland diet so I can’t eat most of what he buys. However on top of that he doesn’t buy milk, eggs, cheese, bread, etc. because I already buy it. Doesn’t buy laundry detergent, or cleaning supplies, etc. This month I’m just gonna have to eat ramen all month. And borrow paper towels and tp from work. I am stressing this!! So would I be the asshole for asking for help?"
259,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my bf he needs to take care of his dog?,13,m0h7b9,19,"Okay, bit of a readbackground- my bf and I moved in together 2months ago, before I used to not go over to his place cause the entire place smelled like dog piss. He used to blame it on his sisters dog (his sister moved, wanted to setup before getting her dog), well she got her dog so now it’s just his small wiener dog. I am a neat freak, I truly enjoy cleaning. My bf is WFH, while I am 2 days in the office and 3 days at home- I honestly do 98% of the cooking and cleaning, but I made it clear if the dog poops or pees in the house, it’s his responsibility- since he’s home all day and his work schedule of flexible and he’s mostly playing COD. When you open our front door, the first thing you’d smell is dog piss (that is if I don’t throw a fit for him to clean up), and I hate reminding him cause it’s not easy to miss. it hits you. HARD. His dog is 8years, he’s had him for 6. He’s not trained, he lets him do whatever. The only rule I made when we moved is in, he’s not allow to sleep on the bed (I know y’all got roast me for that, but idc), this is mainly due to him NEVER bathing the dog, and I break out like hell whenever he sleeps in our bed. I have PCOS, so bad skin condition, I spend a lot of $$ for my skincare and health. Lately due to the piss, i’ve noticed when I get home, and it hits me. I legit throw up. sitting on the couch to enjoy Netflix? pee is all I can smell and honestly have zero idea how he doesn’t smell it. it makes me lost my appetite. He claims I hate his dog, but in reality I HATE how he doesn’t take care of the poor thing and just lets him do whatever. I believe loving a pet doesn’t mean you don’t train him, bath him, clean his bedding, and letting the house smell badly. and tbh the dog stinks also. Sometimes at work, I feel like my clients can smell it on my clothes- and I hate wearing too much perfume. A few days ago, I sat him down and told him if he thinks the dog is just acting up for attention or he has a problem that needs to be addressed/handle with a vet cause I cannot live like this. it’s frustrating and tbh disgusting. He got mad and said “well you don’t have to be a bitch everytime it happens” (this happens daily, i’m aware pets have accidents, but literally DAILY, you’d find a pee spot or he poops near the doors). AM I THE ASSHOLE?"
260,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I refuse to trade my IA appointment slot with a girl tomorrow?,10,m0jkrz,12,"For the ones who do not know, tomorrow my country will have a massive women strike by which they won’t go to work, attend school, or be overall present. I agree with the sentiment and think it’s good they’re standing up for their rights. That being said I’m an IB student with very rigid deadlines, and I’m supposed to meet with my Psychology teacher on Wednesday for her to evaluate my fully finished and corrected Internal Assessment. Due to me being heavily involved with my school’s MUN, I was unable to correct my IA, and I haven’t been able to start said corrections yet. I’m way behind schedule, and I was planning to finish it today and tomorrow alongside other assignments. Since the strike is tomorrow, some girls in my classroom are demanding/asking (depends on the person) that we (boys) give them our Wednesday slots and that we meet with our teacher tomorrow. I don’t know if refusing puts me in the wrong here, and internally I can’t help but think that they’re using the strike to absolve themselves from the responsibility of handing over their work. We all had a week based on when the initial corrections where made by our teacher, and I had even less thanks to MUN. I don’t know what I should do... So would I be the asshole for refusing to hand over my appointment slot?"
261,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling my mother a hypocrite,8,m0m66b,10,"I (18M) currently live with my mother than her husband. They constantly make awful jokes taking the piss out of me, change things and expect me know without telling me and lot of other annoying stuff. One of these annoying things is having a go at me for pointless reasons. My mother will quite often, cook a meal a leave the kitchen a mess and then later when I come down to make myself food (I have to buy/make my own food as I have a part time job), if I leave as much as a speck of anything. They shout at me, for example They also have a go at me for not leaving my room, as we are online learning for college right now I don’t have a reason to other than for food which I eat then go back. I don’t feel comfortable around them, I can’t relax or they call me lazy. My mother tried to get me to go downstairs for college rather than be upstairs all day after a college teacher spoke to her. So I tried it, with permission I plugged in an Ethernet cable to my laptop and moved a dining chair closer to the box to get on with my lessons. The chair isn’t blocking anything, and you don’t go within 2 metres of it normally. I was just trying to do what my mother wanted me to do. Being a Monday I knew I was going to need it there the next day, so I left the chair out of the way near to the WiFi box. She gets home and shouts at me that I need to move it, I ask her why and she just says ‘I’m your mother. What I say goes’. Admitting annoyed I said ‘your a hypocrite’. She responded ‘If you talk like that your not going to be allowed to live here any longer, you need to be more respectful to areas other may want to be in’ She calls them communal areas, but they’re just hers and her husbands. It’s like they just want me locked in my room,  unless it looks bad on them. Should I have just not said anything?, or was I in the right to call her out? AITA? Sorry for the long post"
262,Not the A-hole,AITA for wanting to cut my son's hair,14,m0hb43,65,"Yes this was an argument that included ridiculing me and saying I'm going to make my son ugly. By who? His father. Here's the thing. My son is 19month, he's got my fathers hair so relatively fine but cute ringlets in the back and straight in the front. The hair in front is over his eyes so he's constantly pushing it out of his face and his hands are those of a child..... Always sticky. So his hair always has food in it. I also hate feeding him so his father does, he doesn't clean the food out of his hair just leaves it. He had a raspberry peach Chia cup and between his father and him the Chia was all over his face and neck and that night I was pulling it out of his hair. I want to cut the front to above his eyes so they're not in his eyes as much and he's less likely to wipe his hair from his face with food on his hands. I don't care about the hair in the back. I don't care if when he's not a toddler he grows it out & I don't have to take care of it as much. I've tried hair clips but he just pulls then out now and it hurts him sometimes. His father's arguement is that he will be ugly, look like Joe dirt (he won't), that if I maintain my hair why can't I maintain his hair (mine is always in a bun), that I'm taking away our sons choices (which I think is my job as a parent to a degree) & that if I can't keep my child clean I'm not a good parent. I'm confused because this actually turned into an argument with him yelling at me about it while I think ""....it's just hair"" his father & I do have a lot of problems but it's his son so I can't take him out of his life for disagreeing with me, just hopefully explain it to our son more. Legally I don't think I can. So am I the asshole for wanting to cut my son's hair so it's easier to maintain?"
263,Not the A-hole,AITA for confronting a friend for breaking the rules on a Video Game?,5,m0uyzd,8,"Using a throwaway for this one. So about 2 days ago. Me and a buddy of mine went to go play on a game where you role play realistic scenarios. My friend and I usually play as criminals on the Role Play game.Before I get to the rest of this. We have both played in this community for over a year now. At this point we basically know all the rules and guidelines.So when my friend and I hop in game to do some role playing. Friend sees another player in game who he has had really big arguments with. I tell him to not do any Role Play with the other guy to not escalate anything.Well my friend decides to basically ignore some of the most important rules, and decides to go out of character to yell and argue with the guy who isn’t very good to him. The argument lasts like 10 minutes. I tried to get him to stop yelling and arguing but he refused. Eventually I said enough is enough and stopped playing the game. Just after I hopped off, my buddy did the same. I could tell through discord chat that he was angry.Out of respect for the Role Play Game community that we are both involved in, I confronted him about breaking the rules. We had a long conversation, it got quite heated. Eventually my buddy started swearing at me. So I had enough and just turned off my PC for the day.I feel kinda guilty about confronting him when it is just a game. But I did feel as it may(??) be the right thing to do. So what do you guys think? Am I the asshole?"

They were also best friends until Ben passed away due to COVID a few months back. I've had better days but I'm doing better now and my husband and I go to grief counselling. We have since worked on our mourning and honour my little boy's life any time we can.A few days ago, Kate asked me to look after Lily since she had an appointment. Lily has been nonstop asking me where her best friend Ben has gone and that he doesn't come along anymore when I go over to their house. Truth be told, everytime she asked it hurt and I decided to calmly explain to her that Ben had gone from this world. The exact words I used were ""Ben felt very sick and was in a lot of pain but now he's much better. Sometimes people around you will leave you and it's our job to always remember them and be happy for them. Although he's passed away, he's in a better place and always watching over us."" I was careful not to mention anything in regards to heaven, hell or God out of respect for Kate since she's an atheist. Lily got quiet but then asked if we could write letters to Ben which I happily joined in to help her with. We were both happy and understanding and made cute paper flowers that I could leave at Ben's grave.A few hours later after I got home, I got an angry call from Kate asking why I had talked about death to her daughter. Lily had told her that i had explained to her about Ben leaving and that he wont be coming back. Kate kept saying it wasnt my place to talk about ""darker concepts"" and she had been shielding Lily from all topics related to it until she got older and could understand it better. She kept going on how it wasn't my place to parent her daughter and teach her stuff I shouldn't be involved in and that I could have replied Lily's question by saying he was ""on a vacation"" or ""away for some time"" which really hurt me. Have I done something wrong? AITA? I just wanted to explain to a young girl why she longer got to be with her friend."
265,Not the A-hole,AITA for not believing in my friend’s diagnoses?,159,m03zcb,106,"I (18f) used to very close to a person in the school year below me, we’ll call them Zed (17NB). I have known them for five years as we shared friends. However when I became a senior we weren’t able to hang out as much. We both loved learning Japanese and since my class had very few people the year thirteen and year twelve classes merged together. However there were quite a few changes to my friend group. A few of them came out as trans or NB and changed their names (without telling me) and after knowing them by a different name for five years it took a wee while to remember their new names. So that was the only change at first, and most of my friends were understanding when I accidentally used the wrong pronouns or names. However, Zed would always give me a glare or a scoff and remark on how I don’t see them as people anymore now that they’ve changed. So that was the only problem that occurred at that time. But Zed really started to change. They would constantly ask for us to refer to them by different pronouns like she, he, them, zir and so on, these would change all the time and without warning but they would always get annoyed when we didn’t automatically know. I tried not to take it personally as they come from a religious and conservative household and are likely trying to discover their identityThen there were more changes, they started to announce, during the first ten minutes of class, that they had spent a weekend in the psych ward and how horrible it was. Then they started to tell us that they had been diagnosed with, and I list:Bipolar disorder, depression, dissociative identity disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, autism, ADD, ADHD and Aspergers. This is where things started to get a bit out of control. They would “change personalities” while we were using the group chat. It would literally be like “omg guys I can feel myself shifting” “hi there I’m Isabell  I’m five years old”.They would start making popping noises, clicking sounds and then shake their head uncontrollably, and then when their glasses fell off they would stop shaking, put on their glasses, and then start shaking again. One day we had to do our speeches and just before they were meant to go they said that they were shifting personalities and that this one didn’t speak Japanese and couldn’t do the speech.This just didn’t seem believable to me. They were exhibiting symptoms that they’ve never shown before for disorders they’d never had. Like it was a VERY dramatic change. One of the other seniors in my class privately messaged me saying that she didn’t believe all of these things and that it was very suspicious that they all started at once, and asked me for my opinion. I agreed with her. Turns out she screenshoted and messaged my reply to my friends who then went on a tirade about how I’m ableist, transphobic (idk why, their gender identity was never talked about)  and I was kicked out of my friend group."
266,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for demanding money from my mom for clothes?,7,m0kd21,39,"My grammar might be all over the place and not good. Soo, please bear with me for a while! Thankyou.I (17f) have been asking for money from my mother soo that i can buy clothes of my choice. That money is basically the money i got on various occasions(like my birthday, festivals etc.) She don't really wanna give it to me just cause i have enough clothes already. I could have worked jobs but honestly here in my country normally teens don't work. also, my city is small enough already. I go to a good school and also enrolled in various other activites and stuff.(basically we are financially very much stable) I asked my father the other day to give me some pocket money so that i can save something for myself. Honestly, those clothes that i wear are hugely influenced by my parents choice. They don't let me crop tops, off shoulder, shorts, sleeveless, dresses(even if they do let me wear that should reach my knees) and the tops i wear are always of longer length and TBH it makes me feel soo ugly and hideous. I want to feel great in the clothes i wear but there are only limited options. Whenever i bring the topic of getting the money from her she always scream or tell me to shut that topic as it ain't worth her time. Idk how to ask from her nicely about it without her getting angry. I don't wanna be too pushy as i have already brought that topic several times. Idk but i feel like a asshole demanding money on a daily basis as i think i have become too amandant on this topic."
267,Not the A-hole,AITA for wanting someone to get rid of a therapy rat?,960,lzrsqu,372,"I (24f) share a flat with two other girls, Claire (23f), and Joan (24f). Joan has been dating Noel (24m) since about October (?). Noel is a tad odd but overall an okay guy, he makes Joan happy and that's what matters. Noel can be rather disorganised, as in he managed to sign a lease for his new flat that started a month after his old flat's lease finished. When Joan found out she asked if he could live with us for the month and we agreed.He moved in yesterday (after some time in an air bnb to self isolate), Claire and I went out walking for the day to give them some space. When we got back he was mostly moved in and there was a big cage in the living. There was a rat in the cage and I started screaming, shaking, and crying. I am terrified of rats, they are my worst nightmares realised. I've had a lot of bad experiences with them, and they do simply freak me out.Claire calmed me down, and Joan and Noel asked what was going on. I asked why there was a rat in the living room, Noel said that was Clive his therapy rat, and he was going to be staying with us. I told Noel I'm scared of rats, and I don't feel comfortable having one in my home, and asked if there was anywhere else it could stay for a while. He said no, and left my room.I spent that evening avoiding the living room and mostly locked in my bedroom as I was genuinely terrified. I hardly slept last night as every time I was about to drop off I thought I felt something crawling on me, or that I heard something moving. I spent most of the night crying.This morning I told Joan that the rat needs to go. She told me that I was being cruel as it was a therapy rat and Noel needs it for his anxiety, I asked if it could live in their room, and she said no, because of the smell, and that I need to grow up and stop being so selfish.I guess I could be the asshole as it is his therapy rat and he does need it for his mental health, which I know he struggles with. I also know he can't afford to put the rat in a rattery(?), but I am currently scared and uncomfortable in my own home. My phobia may be irrational, but Joan did know about it and still didn't give me a heads up about the vermin moving in.AITA?Edit: a major reason for my phobia is that as a child I was bitten by a rat and the infection lead to me spending 5 nights in hospital on a drip, which is completely terrifying for an 8yr old. There have been other experiences with rats since which have left me shaken, but that is the major oneEdit 2: After reading some replies on here I decided to do some digging, I messaged Noel's old flatmates, and it turns out it is not an actual therapy or ES animal, he literally just brought it from Pets at Home and used that to move it in with the last landlord"
268,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I didn't invite my mom and sister to my Bachelorette party,123,m04u7z,38,"Writing on behalf of my (33M) fiance (32F)I'm getting married in spring 2022 and asked my mom (early 60s) what she all wanted to be involved with in the planning.  She said everything but she absolutely will be coming to my bachelorette party along with my sister (24F).  I do not get along with my sister at all and wasn't planning on inviting either of them to the bachelorette.  I told my mom we could do something another weekend but I just wanted it to be my friends and I for my bachelorette.  She said if she wasn't invited to it then she didn't want to be part of any of the planning.  I won't be able to enjoy myself as much with my mom and sister there but feel like I will be the AH if I don't invite them now.  My fiance says it's our wedding and it is the one time where we can do what we want and invite who we want or don't want too, but I still feel obligated to invite them to the bachelorette party now.  Extra info: They are invited to the wedding. We are not having a stag & doe or a bridal shower because we don't agree with those traditions. We are paying for our own wedding, haven't asked for any money. Aita for not inviting them to the bachelorette?"
269,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for ditching my friend with my parents for a weekend to go see my boyfriend?,5,m0omie,20,"So I'm 30F and only moved back in with my dad recently because I'm in a medical program and am traveling for clinical rotations (difficult due to covid, but still necessary). My friend from school (28F) had a rotation near my dad's house and is staying for the month as well. Originally I was supposed to be in another state but had to reschedule due to covid, so she originally would've been on her own for the month with my dad and his girlfriend. My BF and I have been long distance since I moved and only see each other every 7-8 weeks or so. So if I were to leave my friend alone with my dad and his girlfriend for the weekend to go visit my boyfriend, is that rude? Would I be the AH?Also...my dad plans on taking my friend to see a national landmark she has never seen before for the weekend. Obviously my friend would prefer I went with them instead but she says she understands if I don't want to."
270,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if i established a curfew for my roommates gf?,60,m08tgm,34,"Okay so the title makes no sense. But here’s the deal:my roommate (18F) and I (also 18F) are super close. We picked each other as roommates after meeting online and things went super well first semester. Best friends, same extracurriculars, similar classes, etc etc. This semester started similarly, but then she started talking to and eventually dating a girl (19) from our floor.I was all for the relationship at first, I knew they liked each other, thought it was cute, etc etc. However, her gf spends ALL her time in our room. Like all. Like cuddles my roommate to sleep every night all, leaves her trash in our room all, I find her clothes while cleaning our room all. To the point where she’s (gf) accidentally referred to the room as “our” room. And i’m starting to get super annoyed. I’m not super close with her, and she put it no effort to get close to me so I stopped trying. I want to establish some sort of curfew of like 10:30pm for her, because I like my space and my time and I don’t really get that anymore - I feel like I have to be “on” all the time and it’s exhausting. I also really miss my roommate, my best friend, who I never see one on one anymore. I’m really hurting, and I confessed this to my roommate while crying, and the response I got was “I view you and gf equally” before leaving five minutes later to go spend time with her gf. So it doesn’t really sink in.I have some other boundaries I want to set, but this would be the first. I just fear I’m being rude or mean for limiting their time together, but I also feel as though my privacy and space isn’t being respected, and I miss my best friend.EDIT for clarification:i worry about getting our RA involved bc of covid rules, bc her gf isn’t technically allowed in our room. getting our RA involved would be ratting my roommate out for breaking a LOT of rules and also admitting to going alone with said rulebreaking and facing hundreds of dollars in fines. they’ve been dating for a little under two months, and i haven’t spent any one on one time with my roommate since they started dating. i’ve expressed wanting to get a meal together like once a week but it just hasn’t happened. she also lists her gf as the sole keeper upper of her mental health, which feels rushed for the timeline of their relationship but it’s also not really my place to remark on that so i don’t say anything. but my roommate does use that as reasoning for her gf being in our room always. my roommate also suggested her gf move in with us in the future but i did put my foot down on that one lol."
271,Not the A-hole,AITA for waving to a lady I don't really know?,101,m05hxl,42,"5 months ago I moved into an apartment building on the edge of my town’s CBD. Basically all the interactions I’ve had with other residents have been short but friendly. In summary, everyone seems to be decent human beings.Recently I’ve been having breakfast on my balcony a few times a week. My apartment faces a reasonably sized road that has a well-maintained running/cycle path along it. At my normal breakfast time (which will obviously vary a little) this path is being used by a decent number of people. About 5 weeks ago I realised one of the regulars on the walking path at the time I’m eating breakfast was a fellow resident of my building a lady who I’d very briefly chatted with when we were both caught by the front door having a glitch. We spoke briefly of how unpredictable technology could be, shared a smile and a chuckle at the slight inconvenience, and when the doors finally opened we went about our days.Once I realised it was her I took to giving her a brief wave or a nod as she passed by. She would, as long as she saw me, return the gesture. We didn’t speak a word, as the distance meant even a shout would be barely audible. This happened a max of 3 times a week. As best I can tell she walks every day, but our schedules meant we might only see each other once a week. It is, quite literally, a wave or a nod, that’s it.Three days ago I’m approached in the carpark by a guy I’ve never seen before. All due credit, he wasn’t aggressive, he simply asked if I was the guy who sees his sister on her morning walk. After a quick Q&A to figure out if I was, I said yes, and asked him what was wrong. Apparently she had spoken to him about “a guy who won’t leave her alone on her walk every day”. When he dug further he managed to drag out that it was a far cry from ‘every day’. I then explained that it was also a stretch to call it ‘not leaving her alone’. We spoke about the situation and it became clear that he had been sent on a mission to not only stop me from interacting with this lady, but to also NOT USE MY BALCONY BECAUSE IT MADE HER UNCOMFORTABLE.I was lost for words. If this lady wants to get about her business without interacting with me then fine, that’s her right. But to believe that she has the right to interfere with what I do in my own home, entirely independent of her, was just stupefying!Her brother was hard to read. I couldn’t tell whether he agreed with the principle of her demand or not. He just delivered everything with a straight face, said his goodbyes, and walked off.In my own head I was simply being friendly, as this woman is the only other resident of the building that I see with any kind of regularity. Any time I see someone else in the lobby or the carpark I’ll give them a nod or a ‘Hi!’ as well, that’s just far less frequent. I’m genuinely concerned that I’ve misunderstood how my actions could be viewed, and that what I’ve been doing is out of line. Is that the case? Am I being really ignorant of the message I’m sending here?"
272,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting mad about my boyfriends parents reading our conversation?,58,m08sw5,17,"For clarity I’m (18F) have been dating my boyfriend (19M) for over a month. Things have been going steady but the only issues we seem to have are his parents. Don’t get me wrong I think their good people and I never tell him to talk to them or nothing I’ll just vent a little and try to find the silver lining in it mostly. But today I felt one of my own personal boundaries were crossed. For more context his parents can be strict, we only get to see each other on Sundays since were both busy Monday-Saturday so Sundays have been our days he also lives an hour away from me so 2 hours of the day is spent with either one or the other driving to the other. Randomly his mom decided they would start having family dinners on Sunday which I could understand but I was sad to see a chunk of our day go, especially since dinner was something I usually looked forward too with him. Besides venting a little about it to him I left it be. After he got home and finished their family dinner they randomly decided that his phone was “distracting” him (his words) and that he needed to leave it in the living room. He reluctantly did but logged into his Instagram on his laptop and started to text me there. Me and him were venting about his parents making him do that after all he is an adult and should treat him like a child. In the heat of the moment I vented a little nothing crazy just basically said he’s an adult and should be able to make his own decisions. Well turns out they opened up the Instagram messages on his phone and saw everything we said. His dad was outraged and I assume took his phone and electronics away since I haven’t heard from him. I feel like they not only invaded his privacy but mine as well. But I also feel like it’s my fault for talking about it and getting him in trouble, am I the asshole?TSDR: I vented about my boyfriends parents taking away his phone to him and they read the messages between us AITA for getting him in trouble?"
273,Not the A-hole,AITA For Posting Photos of My Dog?,9,m0hn8l,36,"I have an Insta page where I post photos of my two dogs. It's not a big page by any means and I don't have loads of followers, it's just something that makes me happy. At the end of the day though it's only a silly Instagram page so please tell me if I'm being ridiculous over this.Last week my cousins dog who they'd had since a puppy died of cancer at 15 and they were of course heartbroken. We live in different countries so I sent them a text expressing my sympathies and sent some flowers as well. Because it was raw and they were obviously grieving I decided to hold off posting any dog pics for a week because they follow my page. Also the main thing here is that one of my dogs, who we'll call P,  really looks like their dog did. P is a little bigger but even though they were both mixed breeds they were the exact same colour and really similar faces.After that week I started posting again and put a photo up of P. It was a closeup of her face so maybe that was insensitive of me and I'll totally accept if you say I was an AH for that. About an hour later I get a text from my cousin saying that it was really cruel of me posting that photo since I know my dog looks so similar to hers. It made her cry and begged me to take it down so I did and apologised. However, she then said she would appreciate it if I took down my page since old posts set her off too. I replied saying that if she felt that strongly she's more than welcome to unfollow the page but I love posting pics of my dogs and my other long distance family like seeing them too. Well she got very angry and said I don't care about her feelings. She won't reply to me now but I just don't understand why she can't just unfollow? She doesnt have to look at any photos she doesnt want to. But I don't want to be insensitive and since she feels so strongly should I just delete it? AITA for wanting to post dog photos?"

275,Not the A-hole,AITA for not cooking for my family anymore?,3261,lzlq7t,386,"I am the cook of the family, meaning i do the cooking and dishes,elder sister does the mopping and cleaning, what i mean is each person is responsible for their own tasks.Last night while cooking dinner I pre-made some chicken/veg stuffed buns so,everyone can get their early breakfast including my diabetic father. I made 24 bums for eight people (me included) so everyone was full and I dont have to cook this morning because i had exams. So i cleaned up after myself and left the buns in the freezer so they dont go bad while resting. (appox 2 a.m. when they went into freezer.)Come this morning i wake up at 9 (exam starts at 10) so i decided to fry two of mine so i dont stave during the exam. but there was none. Only the empty tray.  I called my mother asking what happened to all the buns? She smiled and said they were so yummy, they ate it all, thinking i ate my portion at night according to my elder sister. I was seeing red. I DON'T EAT AFTER 10, and i told everyone, who can cook to leave 3 pieces for me when they are cooking.Knowing screaming at them will be a waste of my time, I some fried rice using leftovers as fast as i could, and had to eat it while giving exam. Didn't eat dinner last night, because sister thought i ate my share and fed all of it to her daughter and herself. I had headphones on and door locked. so when i came out after finishing the exam, the niece was crying on the bed because she threw a tantrum smelling the food and my sister was slamming my door for the next two hours to open up and then yelled at her daughter.My mom demanded me to cook again. But i feel done  and told her, from now on if anyone wants food they can cook it themselves and i am never setting floor inside the kitchen other then cooking for myself.The thing is no one other then me and my mom can cook, And she cant tolerate the heat from the stove. The mother of the niece can cook small tid-bit but not enough to cook for eight people three times a day and younger sister burned her hand few days ago while on pipping hot tea while drinking so she isn't a option.SO Aita if i stop cooking completly because of their behavior?Edit: The wheel of chore started after the lockdown when my mom got to sick from exhaustion. Before that i only cooked diner. And My mom does help me when it's too much work. I am teaching my youngest to cook. And The elder lied today and last night because her brat didn't want her chicken gravy and wanted to eat my vegetable fry with 'roti' too. And threw a fit when she saw the last 3 buns this morning and her mother cooked and fed her without telling anyone. Goood, I hate that B.As for the chores, We all choose what we were good at. So i chose cooking. I am 24 Bangladeshi.btw.someone asked me to specify: I told the family i wont cook for anyone. But technically i cant do that. because one, I am a non-contributing adult basically leaving of her parents. But i will not be cooking for the sister and niece. And yes i resent them for a lots of things. But this was the straw that broke the camels back."
276,Not the A-hole,AITA For Telling My Old Roommate He Needs to Grow Up and Move On?,167,m01678,34,"Hi all, back again. So yesterday, my old roommate (24m, from over a year ago, I’ve had my own place since last March) served me papers for small claims court, claiming I owed him money for utilities that never was paid.All in all, all that he’s claiming is owed is $80. He says I owe him $45 for electric, and $35 for internet. I found this interesting because that isn’t even close to accurate for what I would owe him for half of utilities. I pointed out that while I was moving out he said, and I quote, “Hey man, don’t worry about rent or utilities this month, you weren’t even here for a week and a half so it wouldn’t be cool of me to try to charge you”, which I appreciated because when the pandemic started I was the only one who lost my job because of it.I asked him where he got the $80 from, because I had the text stating he said I didn’t have to pay him for the week and a half I was there, and he said “because that’s how much we discussed you would owe me”.After thinking about it, I remembered he offered to sell me his spare tire for my car for $80, but I never bought it. I pointed this out to him and he said I ruined his life and put him in financial ruins because I never paid him and he’s still suffering, and I pointed out that he had just bought an Oculus VR, which is almost 4 times what he claims I owe him.So he blocked me and reached out to my girlfriend, claiming I’m an addict (which isn’t true) and that I’m a bum that got to live off of $600 a week on unemployment (which is only partially true, I was on unemployment for 2 months before finding a job where I have worked 50-60+ hours a week since then).My girlfriend thinks I should just give him the $80, but I’m not paying him anything I don’t owe him if he’s going to act like he is, and we can’t afford to be giving out money anyway because we have a mortgage to pay, children to support, and we would like to get a new car by the end of the year as the one we have won’t be usable by both of us when she goes back to work.I lived with him for a year and a half, and never once was late on rent or utilities and even frequently covered his half because he spent his money on other things. I told him if anything he owes ME money, and that he was being really weird about everything, and he called me an AH, called my work and tried to say I was on drugs, and told my ex that I owed him money.When he called my job (who notified me they weren’t worried about it thankfully) I told him he needed to grow the f**k up and move on, and it isn’t my fault he doesn’t know how to spend wisely, and that I was taking everything I have from him saying I don’t need to pay him to court. I also said I was going to sit down and do the math and figure out how much he owes me ($576.37) and filing a small claims case against him since he wants to act like this.My gf said I overreacted and my ex is saying Im an AH and should just pay him, guess I’d just like an unbiased opinion."
277,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for not taking my roommate on errands with me,42,m0931z,22,"I (22f) am the only roommate who has a car. One roommate (22f) never bothers me ab anything and virtually never asks for rides. The issue is with (21nb) roommate who always want to tag along to go grocery shopping or to go to the next town over for something. I’m fine with going w them every now and again but gah i just want to go grocery shopping alone. They complain about literally everything so incessantly it’s taking a toll on my own mental health to be around them so frequentlyThey don’t have a car and they don’t like taking the bus. I feel obligated to take them with me when i run errands bc the busses can increase covid exposure risk and i also feel like a dick if i make them wait out in the cold for the next bus when i have a car. They also have no job rn and only one in-person class a week so they never get out of the house. I know how much it sucks to be stuck inside all day and want to get out but i don’t think it should be my responsibility. Things I’ve already tried: mentioning that i want some alone time and i might just go grocery shopping on my own after work. I have been met with “oh it’s just so much easier for us to go together so i don’t have to take the bus. The bus just takes so long and it’s hard to hold all my groceries there.” I’ve suggested they go out on walks to get out of the house for a bit and i am met with “it’s too cold it hurts my knees” TLDR: roommate is starting to drive me nuts and i don’t want to be their chauffeur anymore. but i feel bad bc if i don’t, i risk exposing them to Covid by making them take the bus"
278,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I don't forgive my sister for calling me demon possessed?,158,m01mt4,35,"I (31F) had a fight with my sister (35F) today. (context: fam are evangelical Christians, I’m not. We don't have a good relationship.)\---I live with parents-- my mom was going through chemo and finished right when the pandemic started and I got stuck here. Sister, her husband (39M) and their 2 kids (2 & 4) live in our basement apartment. They’re saving for their first house, have been here for almost 2 years.My parents adopted a dog yesterday, and sister got frustrated at our attempts to keep the dog safe from the kids. They were throwing dog toys in his face, swinging their arms at him, and smacking him. This dog barely knows or trusts us, we were saying things like “oh please don’t throw toys in his face” and “remember you have to be gentle with the puppy if you want to be his friend”. Which I see nothing wrong with. We’re setting boundaries, that’s all.Well today, when the kids came home, my BIL brought the 4-year-old over to the dog’s kennel. 4 says hi, but is stressing the dog out, so after a few minutes I say “I think it’s nap time for the puppy” to which BIL agrees “yeah it’s your nap time too say goodnight to the puppy” but 4 throws a fit as BIL pulls him away. He’s tired, he’s excited about the dog, I don’t see an issue with a small child being frustrated & crying.Well the next thing I know, my sister emerges with evil in her eyes, and starts lecturing me to stop telling her kids what to do. “Everyone keeps telling them what to do so of course they’re going to listen to no one”. I’m confused because I saw nothing wrong with anyone’s behavior. I tell her I’m just advocating for this dog that’s in a strange house, and trying to keep her kids safe. By now she's shouting & v angry.At this point I stand up, flip her the bird, walk away. Maybe not the best reaction, but I had no more words. It was clear she wasn't frustrated at me in particular, and would've yelled at anyone. She started screaming “YOU HAVE A DEMON!! YOU HAVE A DEMON INSIDE OF YOU”.She screams for our mom, I meet mom at the top of the stairs, and simply say “she’s frustrated and taking it out on me” and keep walking to my room.I heard sister continue to shout at my parents from the bottom of the stairs for a few minutes.A few hours later she texts me this:“You don’t have to respond, I just don’t want to ignore what happened and later pretend like everything is okay. It’s not okay and I’m not okay. I’ve been having a bad week and my emotions are on edge. But that is no excuse for letting things get out of hand. I should have come to express myself in a calmer manner later. I’m really sorry for getting so out of hand and I’m sorry for hurting you.“I appreciate the attempt to apologize, but at the same time it’s pretty fucked up to scream at your family like that in the first place.WIBTA if I just respond “I’ll never forget my own sister saying I was demon possessed” and leave it at that?"
279,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking for my money back?,13,m0emy3,42,"August 2019, my “friend” borrowed some money. Around $55, it’s not a lot,  it it was all I had back then and I wanted to help her out. (We are both 21 now)I’m a bit more comfortable now, but we are not on speaking terms anymore. She asked very strangely and get very upset with me, since I’m apparently not allowed to say that I wished she said congratulations when I finally got out of my black hole, and bought myself a new phone. She said that I was a huge AH for expecting that, and that I was a horrible human being for it. Why?? No idea, but that’s another case. Well ^^ that happened October 2020, and we haven’t talked since, and she hasnt paid me back either. She’s by no means poor, and I know that. She gets a bit above $1000 each month and she doesn’t pay rent. Her mother pays for basically everything, so I know that she could pay be back, specially after THIS much time. I texted her today, saying I would like to have my money back by the end of the month. “She” replied with “my woman should not be contacted by a gypsy, can you please remove yourself from her existence you witch”The reply came instantly, so I’m 100% sure she was the one texting it. I’m not a gypsy, nor a witch? I feel like this is very childish, and she should just pay me back, but now I feel like I’m apparently not allowed to and I’m a huge AH for asking it.Am I the asshole here?"
280,Not the A-hole,AITA for conflicted feelings about my family?,4,m0m2tu,3,"(23F) feel somewhat sick of the way I've been treated by my biological relatives. And yes, I am currently living at my parents' house, because I'm super unemployed at the moment (though the desire to have a steady job is very present and I am working towards that goal every day). I think the main problem with my current living situation is my parents. Don't get me wrong, yes, they are caring people…just not towards me, I would say. I am the eldest daughter out of five, and every day I feel like exploding because of how much stuff I hide inside- stuff like my real feelings, concerns, potential feedback, the awareness of the fact that my father either did not want to have children at all (my mother-his wife-is his absolute love, but he is not very attentive towards his children and the conversations are very surface level, and about school or work), or he wanted a firstborn son, not a daughter.  I am the butt of every “joke”, the resident housemaid that does housework because it is what she has been raised to do (genuinely though- I had to learn how to clean and tidy up before I was allowed to cook- if my siblings cook, the cleaning always lands on me), the first child that is the parenting experiment (they did admit that a number of times) so that the children that come after me do not have to go through what I went through with our parents (though I am glad my siblings can avoid that bullshit). I completed my university education abroad, but my social life was following the subconscious rules my mind set up to avoid conflict with my parents- hence I do not have a social life and did not do anything fun or social at any of the universities I attended. A few friends, yes, but truth to be told? I was either at school (in seminars or lectures) or in my room. No wild partying (though I do not miss that specific part), no weird memories, no picturesque university experience. My siblings are fairly okay, especially my youngest- who has been genuinely saving me from myself without even knowing it. But because of the current situation, we are all in the same house, which is a situation I did not plan to be in at this point in my life. One of my sisters is now applying for universities and today she blamed me for making sounds downstairs while she had her entrance exam. I was cleaning – and she had explicitly told us her exam would be tomorrow (Tue), not today (Mon). I had not enough words to react appropriately, or at all- frankly, I blanked. Blue screen instead of my brain. Both parents then insisted I was a dumbass for not realizing it, then it snowballed into a roast battle of sorts (only not the typical stand-up comedy version, but a battle between everyone else, all consumed in the idea of who will deliver a better, more insulting one-liner).Quite honestly, I am   d o n e. I feel like I am drowning in guilt over feeling about people that are supposed to be closest and most supportive.AITA for not feeling about them the way I am expected to feel about family? Is it…reasonable?"
281,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I tell my brother he needs to pay half my car payment for his wife to use my car regularly?,1637,lznjo8,136,My 24M brother is renovating a house (himself) so he and his 22F wife moved in with my mother and me.  (I pay fair market rent for living there. I am not mooching off of her) He has one vehicle and he works night shift as do I. His wife started to work noon to 8:30pm and she doesn’t want to drive his truck (its a stick shift) also he needs it to be able to get to the house and continue to renovate it. When they first moved in November I was under the impression that this would be until January maybe February at the latest and within the month or two they would be getting a 2nd vehicle for his wife to use for work. I told them due to my working night shift and being opposite her schedule they could use my vehicle until they got a 2nd one. They have not gotten it yet. 	He does help by contributing to gas because she’s working full time but I feel like nothing is changing because he has it good right now with her using my car. It’s really frustrating because he feels like when he wants to go grocery shopping with her or if they want to go out to dinner on their day off they are entitled to use my car. This frequently leaves me without my car for large portions of the day. I am only getting to drive my 2019 Kia Sportage to work and that’s it. I feel like if I tell him that i am going to start to expect him to contribute to my car payment this might spur him to get another car but I don’t know if I would be an asshole. Also there is no end in sight of them getting another vehicle or moving out.Update #1:She is able to drive a stick shift but isn’t the most comfortable with driving it. The only thing is he is remodeling the house himself while she is at work during his time off and he needs to sleep too. So she isn’t able to drive his truck because he would really never get the house finished. I am going to sit down with them later this week and have the needed conversation with them. The things i am going to say or ask are:	1 when are you getting a car for wife?	2 you need to have that car by April 1st.	3 if you don’t have that car by April 1st you need to help defray some of the cost of maintaining my car. The reason i was thinking about saying that he needs to pay more IE half the car payment is so that there is more of a financial burden on him and it would be the kick in the pants he needs to get said car. Right now money is tight for him but not so tight that he cant afford to either help me with my payment or to get her a car.Update2: so hopefully this is all a moot point by April 1st. They are going car shopping this weekend. Yay!!
282,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my MIL my baby’s cancer is not about her,10304,lzhafn,618,"I have not told my husbands family and that is because we really do not speak. My husband knows but even with him we are unable to talk on a regular basis due to me being at the hospital and the time difference where my husband is and my emotional state. He understands this. He’s supposed to be home in a few weeks but a date is uncertain.MIL called me today and asked why I haven’t called her to tell her about my daughters diagnosis and why I haven’t been updating her daily since I’ve been here. To which I said I have been emotionally and physically drained. That I could try my best to give her weekly phone call updates but that daily updates via call and or text is not possible for me (we also don’t have social media but I probably wouldn’t post updates there either). She then stated again that she wanted daily updates (no mention about if I needed anything or how I was doing). I proceeded to say “the best I can do is trying to give you a call with a daily update.” I then told her I needed to get back to my baby’s room as I had already stepped out for longer than I would have liked. She started crying and said “you have no idea how I feel. I’m hurting the most than anyone else possibly could.” Uhhh excuse me? I replied with, my baby’s cancer is not about you. I need to go. She hung up. That was that.AITA for telling her my baby’s cancer is not about her? I feel like this is going to be NC territory at this point.Update: thank you for all of the kind responses. I decided to delegate my mother as the person who would update all family including my husbands. When things get a little more situated I will probably have my close friend make a caring bridge account for me and my mother can share that with everyone. For those who asked LO means little one. Also, I think some people forget that my mother is my mother and we are close. No I’m not giving her updates daily. Most of the time when she drops off something for me at the hospital she asks me if I’m ok and offers a lot of hugs and rubs my back and I cry while she holds me. She’s yet to ask anything from me. Therein lies the difference. The relationship I have with my mil has been strained for sometime now. She often believes that I am the one responsible to initiate communication and to foster the relationship between her and myself and her and my daughter. The effort she has put in over the past year and a half has been minimal to say the least. But yet still feels entitled and expects me to visit her home often, call her, update her, text her, etc. For the past month I have been in and out of the er and doctors visits trying to get to the bottom of my baby’s back pain and she’s known about these visits (my husband tells her). Not once as she reached out and asked how we were. How I was. So to those who expect me to treat her equally as my mother is just really asking too much. I haven’t been treated with kindness, respect or empathy ever since I gave birth. She could have easily made an effort to any degree to love me and she has made it very clear to me over the year that she doesn’t care for me to any capacity. Not as her sons wife and not as her granddaughters mother let alone as her own daughter. Whether she likes it or not my baby is related to me and I am her mother and that will never change. She doesn’t have to like me but there does need to be respect and there hasn’t been. So that’s currently where we were before my daughters diagnosis. I am not closed off to reconciliation and healing but that will also require ownership of the things that have happened and have been said and respect for me as a person and as a parent moving forward (all things my therapist has suggested and encourages).Edit to add, my brother who is also in the military sent me two meals this weekend via doordash. I didn’t ask him to and he didn’t even ask me if I needed meals. He just did it. I didn’t update him either. Mil has yet to ask if I need anything, if my LO is ok, how we are doing etc."
283,Not the A-hole,AITA for being a jerk to my stepmom while having a mental breakdown.,6,m0o167,18,"Ok so to start I'm a pretty emotional person but also do my best to make people happy and I think I'm usually a pretty nice/good person.So last night I couldn't bring myself to ask my boyfriend something so we ended our call with both of us having panic attacks but not wanting to worry the other (I found out this morning.) So after we hung up I immediately started freaking out and knocked some stuff over in my room. The noise of knocking stuff over freaked out my dogs so my stepmom came in to see what was wrong. NOw as a note I'm not a huge fan of my stepmom so I just wanted her to leave me alone so that what I said. I just asked her to leave me alone and that I was fine. So for a couple of minutes, she was being really sweet but eventually, she got ticked off at me. So she took my medication away and made me the bad guy by saying ""I was just trying to be nice. Respect the house!"" So I guess I don't know if I was an asshole and pissed her off because of that or if she really just didn't care and I was too much for her to handle.tldr I had a mental breakdown and was a dick to my stepmom when she came in to help but she made me the bad guy with the way she talked to me as she angrily left my room."
284,Not the A-hole,AITA for accidentally staring at people in the parking lot?,7,m0gk13,19,"Last week my dad and I stopped at the pet store on the way home. I waited in the car for about 10 minutes while he went in and got the stuff we needed. This pet store allows people to bring their pets in the store, so there are a lot of animals in the parking lot (mostly dogs). When we pulled in there was a car two spots over that had 2 people in the car presumably waiting like I was, with a very pretty dog poking its head out the window. Also important to note is that their car was parked in my line of sight to the door of the store. I’m a huge animal person so I was just looking at all the animals, and I guess I accidentally stared at this one dog too long. The person in the front of the car probably thought I was staring at the person in the back, so they made eye contact with me and started saying something to me. I couldn’t hear what they said but it clearly looked like they were yelling at me and making a lot of angry gestures. I’m very scared of confrontation so I pretended not to see them and looked away. I accidentally ended up looking back over there once or twice more and they did the same thing. It it’s relevant at all, I’m white and I’m pretty sure they were Black so me looking at them could potentially have seemed threatening. However I’m a teenager and I’d generally consider myself non threatening. TLDR people thought I was staring at them because I was looking at their dog and something behind their car, they got angry."
285,Not the A-hole,"AITA for saying to my mom that""I have nothing against her friend""?",5,m0jvsw,7,"So to add a bit more detail:my mom was talking about how when she gets a drivers licence in August we'll be able to visit her friend whom lives in another state(about 30 hours by car.And yes it's still the Covid rush).I responded with something along the lines of:yeah but it's too far away for you, after your surgery(which she has in May)you'll need more than 3 moths of rest.And that seemed to lit her on fire.Slowly but surely she started accusing me of not liking her [friend.So]( I answer with""I don't have anything against your friend"" well..now she exploded.She's angry because apparently I (16) was meant to be BFFs with her friend (43) and the fact that I wasn't made her MAD.Then she screamed some more about how pessimistic and lazy I [am.Now]( she either won't notice me or make snarly comments.Am I the A\*\*hole?"
286,Not the A-hole,AITA for not participating in my mom's little party?,543,lzsnav,49, Yesterday my mom made a small party for her two siblings and their friends. I think it was about 8 people excluding my parents.   Recently I started working at a store and was having an afternoon shift. I was at work at 2 pm and got home around 1 am. When I got home the guests were still there so I just said hi and went to have a shower and went to bed.   This morning my mom is furious with me because I didn't come and have a chat with them. I told her that I was tired after 10h of work plus the time driving back home. According to her I couldn't be that tired and I was rude.  I could admit that physically I wasn't that tired but mentally I was drained. I have social anxiety and after dealing with so many customers I was at my limit. And there were some people that I didn't know at the party and even thinking about it made me anxious.  My dad is on my side but my mom is angry.  So AITA?

Yesterday she tells me she’s bringing a guy she’s been talking to for less than two weeks with us, and that we’ll have to pick him up on our way down. I told her I’m not okay with that because it’s a personal thing for me, and I just want it to be us two. She asks how it’s a personal thing for me, and I tell her that it’s my personal health. She then tells me it’s not actually personal and that he won’t be coming into the building with us at all, but will be waiting in the car. I told her I don’t care and I still don’t want him coming because I’ve never met him and he has no business being there. She tells me I’m overreacting and that it isn’t up to me anyways because she’s the adult in this situation. AITA?"
288,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting my roommate as my responsibility?,466,lzsww3,44,"My cousin is my roommate. I've offered to help her get a job and come to my firm and make some cash. She is a 30 year old with a child. I'm a 19 year old student on budget, saving every penny I can and preplan out my meals, transportation and rent spendings weekly. I told my cousin to bring X amount of money she will need for everything minimum. She said no problem and she came today from a long trip with expectations that I pay for her food and transportation to job for an entire week before she even started working. She doesn't have enough money for rent either. I have enough for myself only and planned out myself an entire month as well. Meaning if I help out anymore than I can, I'd have to go to my agency to pick up more money and I'm trying to avoid extra train ticket costs and provisions so I can get a clear full paycheck on my bank account. I am not the person to involve myself with borrowing money to/from anyone and I avoid these situations as much as possible. I like to depend on myself only. AITA for saying no to these things? She also never returns money from other people."
289,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I report my roommates.,21,m0avd4,13,"So a while ago. One of my(23m) two roommates. Let's call him Jeff(23m). Invited one of our friends from high school(Lets call him Jake, 22m) to produce music in our apartment. In the living room. He set up his desk and soundboard and is attempting to launch his rap career and online presence. Like he has been since we graduated.Usually its fine. But a while ago the place he was staying at fell through. So he has to basically sleep on our couch for the time being. His stuff takes up a lot of space and I can't use my own computer that was in the living room without moving stuff. My roommates would have people over from time to time before. Which goes against the social gathering policy of my province and is punishable by a fine. But I didn't mind too much cause it was usually our direct family or like 2 friends of ours that we knew well. Since Jake started here it got worse. Way worse. There's lots of noise and strangers when I'm trying to do homework. We got multiple noise complaints and a threat to fine/evict us. Since that incident the noise itself has calmed down at night to not make complaints. But not so much during the day. Which bothers me when I try to do my homework. And then there's STILl more and more strangers coming in and hanging out. All the time. That none of us except Jake know! I've stressed the mandate to them over and over and over. But they just don't listen. I've told them over and over that one report from a neighbor that we're having illegal gatherings could screw us over. And I'm being highly tempted to do that report myself at this point.So. WIBTA?"
290,Not the A-hole,AITA for choosing to go virtual in school for the day>,6,m0io7k,35,"Basically, my mom has been driving me (16) and my twin brother (16) to school as of late, but this morning she said we had to get there ourselves. We had sort of an argument with her over the weekend which resulted in her saying she would take away certain privileges' from us, and apparently this is one of them. I didn't really want to do that, since I kind of woke up and I wasn't quite used to that idea if you know what I mean, so I decided that since my school is hybrid and has virtual learning, I could just go virtual today and start going to school on my own tomorrow. I started my first class and was actively participating in it when I get a text from my mom saying ""go to school or you will face serious consequences"". I told her there shouldn't be a problem, since I wasn't breaking any school rules, but she texted me again saying that there would still be ""serious consequences"" and I'd have to find out what they were.Now I'm all for respecting my parents or whatever, but in this situation, it seems like my mom is being a jerk here. So I'm sitting here during my class' ten minute break, and I decided to type this to see if I'm in the wrong here. AITA?Edit: The argument that resulted in my mom refusing to drive us happened because  we didn't want to go on a picnic with her and my dad. She always plans these forced family outings and then loses her shit when we don't want to go on them. She started raising her voice and even said ""fuck you"" to my brother.Edit again: I can bike to my school, I know the route and I've done it before."
291,Not the A-hole,AITA for wanting to stay home for my twins birthdays?,81,m048va,26,I have twin girls who are 7 in 2 weeks.My husband has an work/social trip (covid free country here) and booked us in for 4 days. (By a 3rd party) However we fly back on the night of their bdirthday when they will be asleep. I offered to arrange for the flights to be changed to the morning so we could spend the day as a family but hubby got angry and said don't bother its too much hassle and to leave it. I told my kids we would be away and they were hurt. Now I don't actually want to go at all and think I should just leave him to his trip (which is more of out of a feeling of anger on my part) and make our kids day special. They will be with their grandparents but I feel so guilty. The extra day way isn't even needed. Thoughts?
292,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting my best friends boyfriend to come on a trip I’m paying for?,5714,lzhkl0,552,"I’m (21F) planning a trip to Italy for 2022. I want to go for 2 weeks but my boyfriend can only go for 1 week. I decided that if my boyfriend can only go for 1 week I can fly my best friend out for the 2nd week and we can have a girls week. The problem is her boyfriend is controlling. He doesn’t want her to go without him. He’s worried she will cheat (which she never has and never would). She pretty much said that her boyfriend will fly himself out for the 2nd week and tag a long. I flat out said no, I will just fly someone else out for the 2nd week. That hurt her feelings because obviously she wants to go and thinks I’m being unreasonable for not wanting him to come. I will not become the 3rd wheel on my own trip, especially when I don’t like him and when I’m the one that’s paying for it. I have a very good job and thought it would be nice to fly my friend to Italy with me and pay for accommodations and everything. She’s saying he won’t let her go if he doesn’t go. I have a hard time seeing how he wouldn’t want her to go experience something like this and would say no. Its Italy basically for free. It’s literally a week. A WEEK. So Reddit, AITA?Edit: I took out the name.Update: I will update you all when I make my decision. I’m still just in the planning phases of my trip. If anything I will rescind the offer because I’m not about to spend thousands of dollars on having her come if it will ruin my vacation. Especially if she has to spend the entire time talking to him or if he was crazy enough to fly out there himself after I said no. I’ve had some people private message me and ask what I do to be able to afford this at 21. None of it is my parents money. It’s all mine. I worked my ass off in college and got a really good finance job.Update 2: Thank you for the awards and all the advice! I really appreciate it all♥️"

294,Not the A-hole,AITA for Wanting to Save Food for Working Sister?,44,m06n1t,12,"For some context, I’m a minor. I live with my mom’s boyfriend, since she hasn’t been able to work and we lost our house. I have three siblings, one who lives with my ex-stepdad. I don’t see him anymore, so he isn’t important.The title is biased, as I am biased to this situation. I don’t think I’m in the wrong. My sister works late, going to work at three and coming back at ten. Normally, I wouldn’t be so worried about saving her some food. But, we got sushi this time(which we never get) and my mom said that we should save her some earlier in the day. My sister can get a sandwich from work, but I’m worried she didn’t because my mom told this to her. When it comes to dinner time, we have a couple of pieces left, and my mom asked if anyone wanted any. I told her that we should be saving it for my sister. She ignored me, and said that her boyfriend should have it. I brought it up again, that we should save it for my sister. At this time, I didn’t know she was angry at me. Her boyfriend didn’t even say he wanted it until my mom pushed further. Anyways, when he leaves the room she starts to yell at me. I was confused at first, I didn’t know why she was mad at me. Then she just got mad that I made her boyfriend feel awkward, and that I shouldn’t have argued? That he did a lot of work, and deserved the extra pieces. I didn’t say that he shouldn’t have had them, but I thought that we were supposed to be saving them for my sister. That was the plan. Am I in the wrong? I’m sorry if I made the story seem confusing and I can answer any questions. I just to need to know if I’m actually in the wrong in this situation because she got pretty mad."
295,Not the A-hole,AITA for not confronting a female coworker?,49,m0687o,35,"My boss had a talk with me. A female coworker came to him about me (she and I share an office with 2 other females and we work closely, 2-3 on the same shift/same time)She feels like there is tension in the office and that I am going to (boss) instead of going to her. She feels like I think she is not doing her job correctly. She feels like I have a short fuse and get easily upset when fielding customer service emails. She told him that I sometimes get so frustrated that I leave the room. I have worked there for 8yrs.4mos in my current position and still training. He has been my supervisor (at one level or another) for roughly half that 8yrs. So he did his best to explain what he perceived the situation to be. She has worked there for 6mos. Her husband was my supervisor at my previous position in the same company. He has been there roughly 1yr. My perception of events: She is training me on a process she is still learning herself. I was shown the end of the process first, and as I have been shown previous steps, they keep changing. The steps aren’t changing because the process is changing. The steps are changing because she is gaining a better understanding of what needs to happen. I find this incredibly frustrating, especially since my time on the shared shift is over and I am on a 3-day shift, 2 days on my own. Our customer service team is all-new. They don’t understand their jobs, much less ours, but they send emails blaming us when customers complain. I get upset because I take my job personally. There have been 2 times during training where I asked her a direct question like “this is the next step, correct?” She barely pulled away from her task long enough to see where I was, but answered anyway. On those 2 occasions, she gave me incorrect info which led to me wasting 2 hours and putting our team behind. On another occasion, I requested clarification on production capacity. The notes said “250/1000 need to go to site A per week” so I asked if those numbers ever changed or if the ratio was always 1/4. Her response: “if it’s the same answer, why does it matter?” I just said “ok”The final straw that led her to speak to our boss was when I sent an email stating my belief that a daily process had not been completed during the 4 days I was off. Her emailed response indicated (to me) that she was missing a key part of the process. She told our boss that “we were trained to schedule by part number” however I pulled up the document she emailed me on my first day and it states “keep the entire sales order together”I know she is technically wrong. I also know that I have an attitude problem. I am working on it to the best of my ability. But I find it difficult to tolerate when others make my job more difficult. I have been burned by attempting to be direct with female colleagues in the past. So I went to my boss to basically ask “Am I looking at this right” which she took as my attempt to undermine her.  AITA for not confronting her directly?"
296,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling someone out for treating me wrong because of my speech impediment.,30,m08nbg,11,"So growing up and even to this day, I have a speech impediment. So anyways a friend of mine when she was younger, she had a accident where she had to relearn her motor skills including speech and back in January, she started treating me bad for no reason at all, I didn't know why and our friend had a talk with and she suppressed the memory but me with my own speech impediment triggered the trauma event and she took it out on me. Picking random fights with me, giving me mean looks, and overall, I felt she hated me, I wasn't suppose to know but I didn't say anything because I saw no point in doing so because 1. I'm going on internship and then coming back for my graduation at the end of the semester, and 2. Whenever me and her had a problem, I always try to talk it out with her but she would ignore me or change the subject. My speech impediment has always been a sensitive subject to me and i would always keep it under control but recently I let my emotions get the best of me and I texted her about how I knew everything, and called her out on it and called her selfish and basically told her I can't forgive her for something like this, especially considering the fact that I got to live like this for the rest of my life and anybody that has a speech impediment or knows someone who has a speech impediment knows how frustrating it is everyday talking to someone. Anyway she's going through a rough time mentally and I always taken mental health seriously because I have my own problems with it and I feel conflicted because one side of me says ""don't feel bad, she put you through hell"" and the other side says ""she going through a rough time right now, you should of kept your mouth shut"".  For those wondering, she didn't say anything and just blocked my number."
297,Not the A-hole,"AITA for writing a story where the main character is autistic, but I’m not autistic myself?",58,m04psu,90,"I’ve been writing this story since I was 13, and I’m now 20, hoping to publish it. Ever since I found out about mental health I’ve been fascinated by it and have made an effort to educate myself. The story revolves around a girl with autism, and also has a service dog for that among other things. But that’s only a small side. The story revolves around her going through high school and finding her feelings for her best friend while learning to cope the loss of her brother in a healthy way and move on. It also centers on how she has a close relationship with her brothers. Part of it came from when I met a family at the store. The youngest, a little girl, was autistic, and she had 4 older brothers who adored her. I watched as they would calm her when a loud noise sent her into a meltdown, and the way they handled it blew me away and melted my heart, and ever since then I knew I wanted my character to have that kind of relationship with her siblings. I’ve done years worth of research on autism and asked over 100 people in the service dog community questions, and I’m aware that I’ll never understand what it’s like to be disabled or part of the service dog community. But one girl keeps saying she finds it offensive that I’m writing a story “pretending to be autistic” when I’m not. I don’t think I’m “pretending” to be autistic. I just came up with this idea, and we’ve had a civil conversation, but I can’t help but wonder if I’m the AH here because I’m still writing this story when I’m not autistic. I do say I respect all people and I’m aware I’ll never understand what it’s like to be autistic or have a service dog"
298,Not the A-hole,Aita for wanting to move out after my dad passed away?,96,m01ip3,25,"Im 28 years old. I've been looking for the perfect apartment for about a year and a half. I was just about to sign a lease when I get a family group text saying my dad has been placed on palliative care: the chemo stopped working. (I really, really thought he was going to make it through. Thats why I was looking for a new place to move to in the first place) My older brother direct messaged me on the side and said that now wasn't a good time to move out. Fast forward 1 month: my dad passes. My mom is inconsolable. She moves into my bedroom. A couple weeks later my mom's dad passes.. We now do everything together. She wakes me up in the middle of the night because she can't go to the restroom by herself. Not that she needs help walking or wiping or anything like that she just can't be alone. My brothers try to spend the day with her while I'm at work. But most of the time, I receive text messages from her while I'm at work asking how soon I can return home. I usually find her by herself in the living room just waiting for me. My brothers just keep their bedroom doors open and consider this to be enough since they spent atleast 8 hours with her already. But I'm the one that has to spend the next 16 hours with her. It has now been 3 months since my dad's passing. We've attended his funeral and then my grandfather's funeral. Am I the asshole for still wanting to move out? Am I the asshole for feeling so suffocated? I told myself I should stay at home atleast until after the one year anniversary of their deaths but I find myself counting down the days until I can be independent. I feel myself growing more and more impatient with my mother.. I can't even spend time with my friends to relax because she's says to hurry home because she's all alone. Am I an asshole??"
299,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to listen to my step-mom?,232,lzvkog,30,"I (15nb) currently live with my mom, her wife, and my adopted brothers. It sucks, and I hate it here. There's tons of shouting and arguing and fear here and it's so hard to exist here peacefully.About 5-ish years ago, my mom and step-mom got married. Before they were married, we had a good life and we're super close as a family. My step-mom has been in my life since I was 4. Ever since they got married and adopted my brothers, things have changed. A lot. When my step-mom isn't out of the house, she's either laying in bed watching some stupid netflix drama or walking around the house yelling about how we are nasty pigs and trailer park trash. How she wants to kick us out of the house. My brothers get the better end of her treatment, so me and my mom are stuck with the insults and yelling and hurt.I was her kid, ya know? She raised me! And now she loves talking about how she can't wait til I'm out of the house, how she's gonna take my brothers and leave. She's been calling me names since I was 12, been calling my mom names for the same amount of time, maybe even longer. My step-mom used to care about all of us and now she'll show blatant favoritism to my brothers. They get toys and candy and trips to the ice cream place and picnics at the park and I get left at home, forgotten. I'm the only one in the house without my step-mom's last name. I'm the only one she doesn't have to worry about legally. And so, because she doesn't give a fuck about me and treats me worse than my brothers, I decided to stop listening to her, and I made my mom well aware of this. At first she waved me off, then she scolded me for setting a bad example for my brothers. So I'm wondering, am I the asshole for refusing to listen to my step-mom?edit to add: there's a lot more going on at home that i didn't mention in order to stay on target for the purpose of this post. if needed, i will elaborate."
300,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for confronting my friend about his lies?,6,m0evok,22,"Dark topic so I’ll give a TLDR at the end.Okay so little backstory. My (17M) partner (18F) introduced me to her friend (18M), lets call him T, of a few years, and we became friends. I’d been given a bit of a run through of his history of lying, and as far as I knew most of them were mild enough to laugh off and move on, except for one lie in the past, where T had told my partner not long after her father was diagnosed with cancer that he also had cancer, which was proven to be false.So, now for the situation. T sent me a message a few days ago, telling me he was in hospital after overdosing, which he knew would affect me because I have actually hospitalised myself before. He didn’t specify what it was he overdosed on, and he kept changing his story about which organs it had supposedly affected. He was planning on not telling anyone, but I mentioned that my partner needs to know since she’s known him longer, and only then did he send a copy of the exact same message he sent me, to my partner.We, knowing his past, were very 50/50 about it, especially since T hadn’t sent a message to my partner’s twin brother, who has known T the longest. It seemed very dodgy. After the twin brother visited T at his home, and spoke to T’s father, he had come to the conclusion that it is most likely a lie.Me, my partner, and her brother, are all considering confronting T as we have had enough of his lies, but we’ve been told by mutual friends that we should give him one more chance. So Reddit, WIBTA if i did confront him?TLDR we are considering confronting a friend because his lies are insufferable, and he has pushed it too far this time."
301,Not the A-hole,AITA for letting my ex believe I cheated?,23,m08q1q,45,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. TLDR at the bottom. First some background:My ex and I had a terrible codependent relationship. It didn’t help that we each have our own issues as is. He had terrible trust issues that stemmed from problems with his parents essentially abandoning him for his half/step siblings and significant others. He’s also incredibly paranoid and gets lost in conspiracy theories, which lead to a lot of problems in his every day life and ultimately got him by disability. I was too caught up in proving my family wrong about how messed up he really was to acknowledge how bad the relationship was for both of us. The boiling point was when he kicked me out and threw all my clothes off the balcony of the apartment we’d moved into not even two weeks prior. In a different state, 14hrs from my family, three days after I found out I was pregnant. Luckily my family took me back with open arms (and surprisingly zero “I told you so’s”) and helped me get back home. We tried to maintain contact and remain civil for the sake of the baby but after enough harassment I got an RO for me and my baby. Here’s where I’m pretty sure I’m the asshole:At some point during all the mess leading to the RO, he got it in his head that I cheated and didn’t believe the baby is his. To be clear, I never cheated. He had me under a microscope (yay paranoia) and we were homeless together up until we left the state so even if I wanted to cheat, I couldn’t have without him noticing! At first I would argue with him because I was annoyed and tired of the accusations. Then he escalated to the point where I started looking into the restraining order and I stopped denying it. I never outright said I cheated but I started giving vague answers or avoided answering altogether. I also left him off of the birth certificate. Eventually he showed toxic sides of him that made it clear he wasn’t stable enough to pull his shit together and after an intimidation tactics and his mom threatening GPR I got an RO. It should be noted I didn’t take this decision lightly, my child’s safety comes before anything and this was unfortunately the best thing all around. I’m prepared to deal with the consequences when she starts asking about her father. It’s coming up on a year of the two year order the judge granted us and after a sad attempt at third party communication at the very beginning, he seems to have given up which is what my ultimate goal was for the sake of my baby. My friends and family think I did the right thing, even the one that had liked him. But I can’t shake the guilt for using his paranoia against him. Also I’m not entirely positive my friends are being honest about how terrible of a thing it was since they never cared for him either. So here I am, leaving it to you. AITA for letting my ex believe I cheated?TLDR: I let my ex believe I cheated even though I didn’t so he would stop harassing me and our child."
302,Not the A-hole,AITA for wanting some space from my friends?,10,m0cjfv,11,"I have a really small group of friends (inner circle I should say) and nothing bad has really happened, we are all great but i’m starting to feel like I just need a little break from them. We see each other about a couple times a week and the small things are starting to irritate me. It’s more like i’m kind of running low on my social battery but it’s hard to see other people because of the world’s current situation and everyone has kind of been going through it. I believe we can all relate. Also I feel slightly uncomfortable because I kind of just want to do my own thing sometimes and start doing activities by myself (find my path and some new hobbies) and because I see them often, they want to join in on them which is fun and I love that sometimes but I just want to go about my own route a little bit. I don’t want to tell them directly because obviously they haven’t done anything “wrong” exactly. I just need time to focus on me without them watching or trying to be a part of a journey I set up for myself. So reddit, AITA for wanting some space?"
303,Not the A-hole,AITA if I don't go see my paralyzed great uncle in the last days of his life because of how he's treated my family members in the past?,19,m09e1t,21,"Buckle in because there's a bit of family tree tracing that's gotta happen. Now, I have a great uncle, my father's paternal uncle. He's done several undoubtedly mean and terrible things in the past. He and my paternal grandfather (his brother) did not get along very well for a few years, and my great uncle cut off my grandfather from him, and as an extension, all of his children and grandchildren, my father, mother, siblings, and myself included, for a relatively minor and forgivable issue. My grandfather had a bit of a soft heart (emotionally, not medically) and did not take the disownment very well, and it did bother him, however much he tried to hide it. When my grandfather had terminal lung cancer and was on his death bed, he asked my father to go to my great uncle and ask him to come visit him, as a final goodbye. My father is a very prideful man, but managed to swallow his ego and went, hat in hand, to see my great uncle to ask him to come see his brother, as he had specifically asked for it. Great uncle flat out refused, and didn't even come to the funeral. My grandfather died not ever getting the chance to say goodbye to his brother who he loved and respected so much. Fast forward a few years, I'm 24 and in medical school now. My great uncle had a massive stroke a few months ago that left him in a total vegetative state - fully paralyzed, unable to speak... basically a body bag just counting down the days until he passes away. Apparently, according to my grandmother and other elders in the family, it was my great uncle's dream to have someone in the family become a doctor. Everyone is asking me repeatedly to go visit him and tell him I'm on the way to becoming a doctor so that he can atleast have that wish fulfilled. I don't want to. I haven't spoken to this man in nearly a decade, and the fact that he denied my dying grandfather his last wish as he lay in pain and dying from tumors literally choking him to death is unforgivable for me. It's caused several fights in my family, as my relatives consider it a big deal and majorly disrespectful for me to not be able to put aside my grudge and go see my great uncle before he passes away to give him some closure and relief. A lot of them also had minor issues with him in the past that they managed to put aside in ""his time of need"", and now I am expected to do the same.I'm torn. On one hand, I think I should stand up for what I think is right, and that is respecting the memory of my wonderful grandfather and not bowing my head to someone who so blatantly disrespected him. On the other hand, I can see the argument of forgiving him, of being the better person, of not denying my great uncle while he is on his own deathbed, etc.WIBTA if I didn't go visit? I know it might sound contrived but it's really been weighing on me, and I've gotta act soon, because... who really knows how much time the guy has left?"
304,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my ex he was very inconsiderate of our daughters when he found out the gender of his new child with his wife?,21333,lzb22o,1448,"My ex and I separated about 4 years ago now. We have a 7 year old and a 5 year old girls. He has a son from a previous marriage that he has full custody of, he is 10. He’s been remarried for 3 years now. I recently got married and welcomed a son last year. Well I dropped the girls off to their dad for a gender reveal party. Ex and his wife are expecting. Well I was watching the live video on Facebook and it was a boy. He said “thank god, thank god” then he said “I didn’t want anymore girls. I would have shot myself” my girls were standing there and that looked at the camera and I could see it in their eyes that his words had hurt them. I went to pick my girls up and I told him he should watch his words around the girls because when he said that it really hurt their feelings. He told me it was none of my business and I was trying to ruin his happiness. To which I responded that I was not trying to do that but protect our daughters for never feeling adequate when it comes to their brothers and he was showing blatant favoritism. He got mad and spewed some nasty names at me. I took the girls home and they told me that their daddy only loves boys and he doesn’t like girls. I calmed them down. AITA for bringing it up to him on their special day?"
305,Not the A-hole,AITA for not apologizing for making noise moving a 100lb package into our apartment at 11am?,132,lzx9b8,41,"This morning I got a 100lb safe from FedEx. I pulled it into the apartment, unboxed it, and since my partner was still asleep I slid it onto some cardboard and slipped it to where I wanted it, then I cleaned the closet like I said I would todayAbout 2 hours later I walk in to take a shower and my girlfriend starts saying how I was being mean by making all that noise, and asked me to apologize. I stated I didn't feel that was necessary since I don't feel like I did anything that is worthy of an apology. This ended up causing a huge argument and now she won't talk to me. Im happy to apologize for something I do or a mistake I make, but I told her I was moving a package before I got out of bed and refrained from asking her to help so she could sleep. I don't feel like that's something worth apologizing for. That noise does suck especially in a small apartment, but it was an inconvenience of what, 20 minutes. She also went back to sleep after the noise was done. AITA for not apologizing?"
306,Not the A-hole,AITA for being distant?,18,m09955,12,"I’m an 18 year old female and growing up, I would visit my dad on weekends because I wanted to see him. His girlfriend, Ruby would watch me when my dad was sleeping bc he worked 2 jobs. One example of when I did spend time with him was when we went to the beach with some of his ‘friends.’ Before we picked them up, my dad turned to me and asked me if I was okay and then told me to not tell his friends about Ruby because he didn’t want them in his business. I shrugged it off thinking everything was fine and two couples and a woman got in the van with her kids. When we got to the beach I was having fun building sandcastles with the single woman’s son when I saw the single woman on my dad’s lap, kissing him and laughing with their friends... Ruby left my dad a few years later. There were at least two other women I was aware of (while he was dating Ruby). He would often leave me with their families while he’d sleep in their rooms because he was tired. The women always treated me kindly and I was never in any danger. But the idea that he was willfully bringing me into his affair and expecting me either not to know better or to keep my mouth shut/lie hurts me, especially since I’m his only daughter. When I was 14, he visited me to drop off my birthday present with a very pregnant woman in the front seat, Stacy. He introduced her to me as his wife. I was didn’t even know he was married, or that they were pregnant. My senior year in high school, we didn’t include my father in the FAFSA as he has two younger kids to care for and when he did pay child support, my mom had to harass him for it for days after it was due. According to my mom, my father even told her that he would cut off all contact with us if we put him on the financial aid form (which would make him a contributor to my education). I haven’t spoken to him since ( 6 months). He’s been telling my mom about how I’m hurting his feelings and that I never call him (he said that a lot). I feel bad for having to lie to people when they ask me about my family. I also feel bad because he would always give me pretty expensive gifts for holidays as a kid but we barely ever spent one on one time together, and when we did it was awkward. He’s never been directly rude to me and has always been kind and upfront about his love for me, and I fully believe that if I were in the hospital he would be there asap. Recently, I started working a minimum wage, part time job to help pay for college and, once my dad got wind of it, he threatened to stop paying child support (which he’s obligated to pay until I’m 21). I don’t know whether this was a joke or not as I didn’t hear the conversation between him and my mom but it makes me furious that he would even say something like that. My older brother and I are currently making time to see each other so I can form a bond with him and my adorable niece. We’re both not talking to my father at this point in time. So please give me your opinion, AITA for cutting my dad off?"
307,Not the A-hole,AITA for buying a claw machine?,4956,lzeyzs,596,"I am 20. I still live at home as my university is close to home. My partner got annoyed with me for having too many stuffed animals in my room and honestly, my mom said the same thing so I guess they were probably onto something. I own too many stuffed animals so I bought a claw machine as a cool way to store them. It’s also cool to just practice and play. I go to Japan every year usually to visit my grandparents and in Japan, arcades are really popular. I played a lot growing up and honestly that’s why I have so many stuffed animals. I asked my mom if I could get one and she said yes if I’m paying for it. It’s in my basement. My boyfriend, who I plan on moving out with eventually, is really upset with me. He hates the claw machine and thinks it’s ugly and doesn’t want to deal with it in the future when we live together. He told me that when we move out, he wants me to sell it and most of my toys. But I can’t stand the idea of doing either. A lot of my toys have good memories from Japan. A lot were won by or given to me from relatives that have passed away. AITA for not considering my partners feeling before purchasing it?Update: hi I’ve decided to dump him. he hasn’t been notified yet.Update 2: i bought two squish mallows and put a story up on instagram of my friend and i hunting for them. he messaged me about the story and said he hope those were for my friend. after consultation with my new friends and my non stuffed friend, he’s been notified of my decision.

308,Not the A-hole,Aita best friend blows up on me after I refuse to hang out,9,m0citt,11,"My best friend (18f) has depression. She always has strong reactions to everything and freaks out over every little thing. I(18f) have seen her blow up on her family and she doesnt care and starts to curse ALOT. Two days ago, she hit me up late at night cause she was feeling bad and I was able to support her unlike before because my boyfriend taught me how to comfort people. She said thank you and seemed very happy and relieved. At the end of the morning, she asked to hang out. I'm not a fan of that for obvious reasons of rona. She already got it and says that she's immune for 6 months though I'm not sure if that's true. She wants me to come over to her house and then gocwirh her to her therapist. I didnt want to but I told her I'd ask my mom anyway. My mom is pretty strict and has a history of not letting me go out whether for rona or not. Both of my parents are high risk so I understood when she said no. Luna asked me to try really hard but I didnt wanna risk anything. She thinks it's all safe and just doesnt care. Next day  I didnt try to convince my mom and when she knew my mom said no she blew up. told me if I dont wanna hang out with her to just tell her then she tells me fuxk you and have fun with your fucking mom. It hurt me really badly. So ive been waiting for her to talk or apologise since yesterday but she hasn't hit me up. In the time I've been thinking ALOT and maybe I am an asshole since I havent exactly been nice before I just started learning how to comfort  people. But I hate that she has started feeling entitled to my time and everything cause this is not the first time she has blew up on me for refusing to hang out or not being there for her. so I was pretty harsh and I told her to stop having a tantrum every time anything foesnt go her way yesterday as a retort. So maybe I am an asshole.Aita?"
309,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting upset over social media post?,3,m0fvd0,47,"TLDR my bf who never posts on social media posted another girl and told me I was being insecure I’ve (30f) been dating this guy (28m) for 5 months and during the whole time we’ve been dating I’ve never seen this man make any posts. He NEVER posts, everrrrr! He doesn’t even post stories to his ig or Snapchat. Well we got into a huge fight yesterday because he said I was being insecure about his post and that it was ridiculous. He’s a personal trainer and I’ve known that since the get go, I understand he works with many types of people. Well I noticed he posted a story to his Snapchat and it’s of a girl wearing a sport bra and leggings and it’s just a clear view of her ass. When I called him out on it, he said I was being insecure. He said it was a post to get advertisement for his gym and more engagement from his followers. I didn’t see it like that at all. To me it looked like a cheeky posts of a girl he’s possibly dating and he’s just introducing her to his following.. like a subtle flaunt. He NEVER posts, but this one time out of the blue it’s of a girl? Then when I called him out on it he said he’s not some pig she’s 10yrs younger than him and “she’s like a little sister”. I’ve heard this girls name once very briefly since we’ve been dating. Normally I wouldn’t care about a post if it was a regular thing but this post really irked me. The post was a video of a girl where he captions it “braids and hip flexor type day”. He had the smallest tag of the gym and he’s not even saying anything it’s just a view of her ass doing a squat type thing and that’s it. What’s your opinion?"
310,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if i post a negative review for my old doctor?,22,m09c83,21,"So i am a type one diabetic and found out i was pregnant super early (like 4 weeks or less). My endocrinologist and I arranged some weekly appointments from the get go. After the first one i was continuously still have high blood sugars. When i called the office for help i was told to stop calling and bring concerns up at the next appointment (four days later). At one point she made a treatment decision that raised concerns with my obgyn, dietitian, primary care and therapist. I had my own concerns to. So at the next appointment i raised my concerns she ignored it and when I mentioned all these other doctors were concerned she lost it. Saying I wasn’t allowed to discuss treatment plans with my doctors and that I needed to listen to her.I guess my endo and obgyn had a conversation. My obgyn said they would be able to refer me to a MFM doctor when i came in for my 8 week ultrasound (they needed a due date). I called my endocrinologist’s office to makes my next appointment and was told they weren’t allowed to make any for me and my obgyn should handle my diabetes until I could be seen by the MFM doctor. I was 6 weeks at this time. So essentially i have my endocrinologist for 2+ weeks while pregnant.Trying to get a new doctor. But once I have one i wanted to write a review detailing this entire drama publicly to warn others. But im obviously pregnant so hormones are a factor...so WIBTA if i wrote a bad review?"
311,Not the A-hole,AITA for hitting snooze on my alarm?,6,m0cy4x,28,"My spouse and I work different shifts and my alarm goes off at 2:00 am but he doesn’t get up till 5:30 am.  He’s a light sleeper but I am not.  Today I hit snooze on my alarm so when it went off the second time he yelled at me.  He was pretty pissed off and said he laid there awake the instant my alarm went off the first time.  I said sorry and I’ll start sleeping on the couch. I try to be quiet when I’m getting ready.  He yelled at me last week because I made a coffee when I got up but the spoon made a noise when I was stirring so he got up out of bed to come yell at me about it.  I had already finished stirring so it seems like a wasted effort to get up to yell at me to stop.  So now I don’t make a coffee when I wake up.  I creep around in the dark as quiet as possible but I know any little sound could make him mad.I’m mad just because I said sorry and I just don’t think it’s worth getting so angry that he yells at me.  He wakes me up when he comes to bed all the time and I don’t yell at him.  He just has zero patience and no filter.  I always think if the roles were reversed how would I react?  I never raise my voice to him.  I never start the fight or argument.  He would be so pissed off if I ever spoke to him the way he talks to me.  There are obviously times that I get upset with him but I bite my tongue.  I don’t lash out at him ever.Who’s the asshole here, is it me because I hit the snooze button?  I don’t always hit snooze, I just sometimes have a hard time waking up so it’s not something that happens every day.  Obviously I’m scared of angering him so I try to wake up as quickly and quietly as possible.  Should I start sleeping in a different room?  Honestly I think he would hear my alarm from anywhere in our apartment."
312,Not the A-hole,AITA for accusing my mother of body shaming me?,14,m09rbt,9," Currently I (24f) am living in a different country and for various reasons am not talking with my mother for almost two months. I sometimes reply to her texts but ignore her calls.  I have a lot of history with her which I don't want to elaborate about in this post. But one major part of it includes Body Shaming.  I have always been insecure about my body. I'm very thin and how much ever I eat, it does not contribute to my weight. Its been like that since as long as I can remember. My mother was thin too before her marriage.   The insecurities are still present but I feel better than before as I'm slowing learning to accept myself. My parents, neighbors, relatives, friends and even strangers have passed comments on my body, which is mean according to me but funny according to them, which includes calling me just bones, saying nobody would want to date/marry me, saying I'd fly away in strong wind like that's the best joke ever, saying nobody will want to be with someone with flat boobs, and more stuff which cannot be properly translated from my mother tongue to English.  And I had no problem with my body till others started pointing out that I SHOULD have a problem with my body. And honestly, for so many years it hurt me so bad. What everyone called ""concern"" was just taunts for me, because otherwise why would it be mean and hurt me?  And I would have gone through it all only if my mother was by my side. But she was also the one saying mean stuff to me. And now at this age, I'm angry with myself because I let this happen to myself.  Because of this and many other reasons, I am not talking with my mother anymore. I did talk about this to her. She said that I am overthinking, that she was showing concern as a mother. Hoping her taunts would give me a feeling that I should become healthier. I told her that her taunts effed me up and only if I had her support, I would get the courage of standing up for myself. In the end, she has not taken responsibility for anything and gave an half assed apology.   ""Sorry if I made you feel bad"".  which according to me is not an apology.  I talked to my younger sister about it but she is just 14 and I love her a lot. She is still small and probably does not understand because she says exactly what my mom says. That mom was doing all this for me. I can't talk to my friends about it because they would pass comments on my body too.  Am I being an asshole for accusing my mother of body shaming me and being angry about it? I honestly don't understand anymore.  NOTE: My mom commented on my teeth, weight, hair, lips and face size before and I remember it. I couldn't change how I look and it made me sadder. Because of other reasons I know that my mother is a narcissist and manipulated me. But I love her a lot, and I still do. that is why I needed her support the most. Also, I am an Indian and it is a common practice here to comment on someone's weight, whether the listener likes it or not."
313,Not the A-hole,AITA for agreeing to create a free commission art and then changing my mind?,23,m07lpk,13,"I (22f) am a digital artist, most of the artwork I create provides content to grow my social media. At the moment I haven't earned any money from my art.A few months ago my aunt reach out to catch up with me, informed me about my cousin attending an Art college, and inquired about my recent artwork. I sent her a few things I posted online already, she complimented my art and asked me to help my cousin improve. I looked at some of his work and gave him some pointers on where he can improve and sent some video references. Later the conversation progressed to her asking me to create an art piece for her, as a kid, I used to draw free pictures for her. We haven't contacted in a while, so I felt bad for not visiting for over 5 years. I didn't think it would be so bad to draw it for her as a gift. The art she requested was two women sleeping next together sounds simple on the surface, until I sat down and realized how much work it would be to produce this art piece. I needed to ask her in detail what she wanted but she didn't provide any guidance, I did a lot of research to find a bunch of references, and try to create the piece with an unfamiliar art style I haven't in years. She wanted to print it on a pillow so I need to create a file 3600 x 4320 which limited my layers, I was very unhappy and uncomfortable creating this piece. Eventually, I took a break and started other projects I was more interested in and forgot it with all my other sketches. She contacted me a month later inquiring about it, I sent her outlined copy and put it down again. I did felt guilty, Until today when she contacting me about the art, I told her I can give it to her by the end of the day. I finished most of it, then she informs me she wanted me to create this artwork to have someone mass produce the image on products for her. My jaw drops like, are you kidding me??! I thought this was a **personal piece** which is why I put myself through this stress for ""Family"".  I could have made a lot of money from all the **effort** and **detail** I was adding to this piece let alone charging a **mass production fee**.  Now I have no intentions of finishing this project and giving it to her. I don't know how to tell her, I'm not finishing this art piece without receiving a percentage of the profit or upfront cost for fees and labor."
314,Not the A-hole,AITA For bringing my laundry home from college,13,m09uie,29,"So I (18F) live on a college campus where laundry is really expensive to do especially for someone like me who separates her dark, colored, and white clothes. This is why I avoid doing too much laundry on my campus so when I go home for the weekends I bring my laundry basket with me. The first time I brought laundry home I got scolded by my cousin(30F) for bringing laundry home and telling me I was inconsiderate because she was going to do her laundry, even though the laundry was empty and her clothes were still in her room. I should mention she works from home so she has the whole week to do her laundry. The second and the last time I bring laundry home I got scolded again for bringing my laundry and I told her that laundry in the dorms are expensive and she said that was not her problem and that I chose to live on campus this semester. It feels like I don't have home anymore. AITAEdit: Sorry for the lack of information this is my first time posting. It's actually my aunt's house. I've been living with my aunt for the past 4 years. My cousin recently moved in during the pandemic because she didn't need her apartment anymore since she's working form home. Also my aunt has told me countless times before that I should bring my laundry home to save money. My cousin is her daughter."

316,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my mom share a picture of me with her best friend?,10,m0aqec,13,"ok so first i may delete this post later, and if your like a reddit repost acc on instagram or something please dont repost this. ok now me (high school, F) and my mom were straightening and cutting my hair tonight and it took a while. however when we finished it looked AWSOME. so awsome i took some pictures. after i took some my mom asked if she could take one too and i said no, then i reconsidered going “eh whats the harm?” and said sure so long as she dosnt show anybody besides my sister. she got huffy and said “why whats the point if i cant show anybody?” and after a little talking i was like “fine you can show it to my sister.” she was still upset and said she wanted to show it to her close online friends. i am not ok with this. yea shes close to her online friends but i am not. i do not share my pictures with strangers. she got huffy and said that “they aren’t strangers, they’re my friends!” and i said “well they’re strangers to me.” and after a bit of begging (like 2 minutes) she stopped asking and said i was being mean. i said “i’m being mean for having boundaries?” and she got mad. at some point (i have a bad mental timeline lol) she said something along the lines of “i think your being mean.” and i said (a bit cheerfully) “well your wrong” and she said “i’m wrong for having feelings?” now shes being mad at me, kind of ruining my night (i hate it when moms mad at me.) so, AITA for not letting my mom share pictures of me?"
317,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling my girlfriend ""I don't want the dog, leave and take it with you"".",6703,lzcknr,888,"Hi everybody!So a few days ago it was my birthday, and my girlfriend said she's going to bring me a gift on friday and that i will love it. So i said ""ok sure thanks"".On Friday night when I'm chilling at home sipping a beer my girlfriend opens the door and a Pitbull dog runs to me and starts barking at me loudly at me.I get confused and I think ""oh maybe it's the neighbor dog which accidentally came inside"". Our neighbor doesn't really put a leash on his dog and many times his dogs will come inside our house and want to play with us because we keep our garage door open, lol.So i pick up the Pitbull and decide to go return the dog to my neighbor. Before i leave the door my girlfriend's like ""Wait, babe! That's your present!!"" and I'm like ""What?! I don't want a dog for a gift"".Reason why  it's not because i don't love dogs. I love dogs and growing up as kid we had numerous dogs. But right now I can't take care of a dog at the moment because I'm usually relocating all the time due to jobs, work etc. Plus i work long hours and after coming home i can't devote time to an dog. I just can't. I can't take responsibility of the dog. There's a lot too it. I just can't.So i hand the Pitbull to my girlfriend and tell her ""you keep it, or return it whatever I'm fine, Thanks"".Then she starts sobbing and all then she takes the dog home with her and leaves.AITA?"
318,Not the A-hole,AITA for meeting behind friend’s back with a romantic interest,3,m0ovdr,9,"I’m a male with many girl friends. One of the closer ones, let’s call her Sasha, offered to set me up (as in date) with her friend Paula. The three of us met around 10 times in the past 2 weeks. Now I have made it very clear that I would pursue a romantic interest in Paula to Sasha. I asked Paula out for tomorrow (which she agreed) and told Sasha about it. She immediately got her passive-agressive tone and after ranting, hung up. I texted to say that she was being rude (sounds much kinder in native language), and that she shouldn’t make this personal. She criticized me for meeting Paula behind her back. Ironically I had previously introduced the idea of a 1:1 meet up.tldr friend set me up with a girl, the three of us hung out, i asked the girl out and my friend got mad"
