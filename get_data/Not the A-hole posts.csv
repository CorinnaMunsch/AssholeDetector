0,Not the A-hole,AITA For suing my girlfriend after she had my 1967 impala project taken to the scrapyard?,70805,gr8bp3,2789,"I'll try to keep this short. I had a [1967 Impala 4 door]( that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITAEdit: Thank you all so much for the support and awards and everything. I'm glad I have some people on my side. I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life. I've been gathering documentation and stuff and I'm about to head down to the police station and file a report, as suggested by lots here. Once again thank you allUPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait nowHUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice! SHES GONNA BE ALRIGHT"
1,Not the A-hole,AITA for pretending to get fired when customers get a temper with me?,63532,e5k3z2,3663,"I am a high schooler with a weekend job at a coffee shop. My coworkers who work weekends are: James - the owners son, he goes to my school. He's a shift manager but it's not a real formal thing, he's a friendly guy.Danielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too.So sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it's a lot... Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.So James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.So one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.So James came in and was like ""sir is there a problem here"" and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like ""OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired."" I started acting real sad, like ""no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee"" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.The angry guy started to backtrack, like ""It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it"" and James was like ""No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service""Of course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and ""fire"" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences. Anyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.AITA for this joke?"
2,Not the A-hole,AITA for punishing my son after he said something racist?,52906,iagtso,2650,"About a week ago, my (39F) family ordered Chinese food for delivery. When the delivery driver came to the door, my daughter (16F) was taking the cat upstairs to put in her room because he always tries to eat the food. My son (13M)  loudly says, “Make sure the hide the cat from the Chinese guy!” as I am at the door getting the food from the Chinese delivery driver. He very obviously heard what my son said and was upset by it. I quickly apologized and took the food. I told my son that racist jokes were completely unacceptable and very wrong and he refused to admit that he was in the wrong. So, later that night I forced my son to write a sincere apology to the delivery driver, (his name was on the receipt) as well as write a one page paper on Chinese culture and a one page paper on why racism is perpetuated by racist jokes and stereotypes. Then the next day I took him to the restaurant and had him read his apology aloud to the delivery driver as well as give him the papers he wrote. The driver was very appreciative of the apology and thanked me for making my son do it. He then told my son about multiple instances where he had faced racist comments and attacks from people while he was a delivery driver. That night my husband (43M) and I got into an argument about me making our son do this. He told me that it was embarrassing for our son to have to do the apology and that the “punishment didn’t fit the crime”. I told him that it was much more embarrassing for the driver to have to face that kind of racism and racist stereotypes and that our son would get over the embarrassment. I do not condone any kind of hateful thinking in my house, and the fact that my son said that embarrassed me as well. My husband told me that it was “just a joke” and it wasn’t that big of a deal. I feel like I might have over reacted some but I think it’s important to help my son understand how what he said was wrong and hurtful."
3,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for refusing to stop cooking bacon in my kitchen due to my teenage daughters vegan lifestyle?,51397,dkqv29,7576,"Dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but I’m struggling to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one. We’ve always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural Midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. None of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I’m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn’t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it’s not YOUR pan. She asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn’t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they’re colored is so it helps me remember that I’m not to touch them unless I’m cooking vegan. That wasn’t good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is ‘contaminated’ with animal product, and the fridge has ‘bacon grease fingers’ on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she’s asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don’t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it’s clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. frankly I’m on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife’s reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn’t want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it’s specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I’m sorry for her, but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I’m not going to stop eating bacon in my own house."
4,Not the A-hole,Aita for wearing the “joke” bikini my friend got me?,50960,d7yuot,4046,"So it was my birthday couple months ago. Had a party. Got some gifts. My friend “Mandy” for me a “super cute bikini”. I liked it. Said thanks. She had ripped the tags off but whatever. Anyway. Went to the community pool with my roommate. Wore bikini. Got in the water. Roommate immediately is like uhm girl.... I look and see that this bikini is now kinda see thru. Haha good joke Mandy. Anyway, Mandy invited me over to her place to hang out with her and her bf and a few others. Most leave and we’re still hanging out. I’m like hey, what if we get in your hot tub? I go change after them. And meet her bf in the hot tub she’s getting new drinks. I hop in. Immediately, he’s looking at my chest. I pretend I don’t notice and just make small talk. She comes out a few min after. And just looks in shock. Eventually gets in. “Uhh is that the one I bought?” Yeah I love it. I wear it everywhere. Make up some stuff about how I wore it to the beach, some party with lots of guys, etc. and she’s just like “oh”. We’re in the tub for 20-30. Eventually get out and change. She approached me after and was like. “Uhm I’m sorry thought you’d notice. But it goes kinda see thru”. I’m like yeah I know why’d you buy me a ducking see thru bathing suit? “She’s like it’s a joke. Wait you knew? So you just spent last 30’ flashing my bf on purpose?” I reply I’m just wearing my birthday gift from her. Anyway. Aita?"
5,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my son he deserved his gf breaking up with him?,47772,daglhs,4019,"So my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. She was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. She was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn’t lift a finger to go visit her. I tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. He said no. And my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. I spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he’d have to fly over to her country too. Which is fair enough. He said no, he didn’t want to fly or travel anywhere. My son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. Last week, he told us she’s dumped him. I went on her fb page as we’re all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she’s upset it didn’t work out but these things happen, so we’re on good terms) and looks like she’s with a new guy already. Me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. I confessed to them both that I actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. He did not treat her properly and I hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. I said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time. Wife and son are very upset that I said this. Very very upset and my wife says I am being horrible. AITA? I stand by what I said."
6,Not the A-hole,AITA - Telling my parents to pay me back my college tuition if they want a relationship,47563,i9pm5u,2803,"I was raised by parents who believed (religiously and just culturally) in rigid gender roles. Dad should work, mom should stay home with the kids. I’m the only girl and have 3 brothers. Because of their expectation I’d stay home with kids, they never valued my education, educational achievements or emphasized things beyond domestic skills. I’m the second youngest. By the time I was in high school, my two older brothers had gone to the college of their choice, with my parents fully covering tuition, books, an off campus apartment and other living expenses. They eventually did the same for my younger brother. I was told I wasn’t allowed to apply for college.I did so in secret and got accepted with a partial scholarship. I didn’t tell them I was moving out until a week before I left, with essentially nothing but what a few friends gave to me that their parents bought “them” for college. I took engineering, and had to work, take on debt and struggle.My parents and I have barely spoken for years. I’m married now and expecting our first child, and they asked to meet up. We met at a park, and they said they were “sorry if they caused me pain” but would like a relationship now. I asked them specifically what they were sorry for. They wouldn’t elaborate and just said they wanted to move forward. I said that wasn’t sufficient. In the end, I said they could prove they were sorry by forwarding me the $100k my degree and college expenses were, just like they did for my brothers. My mom burst into tears, my dad said I wasn’t being serious and I just left. Since then, I’ve been getting calls from my brothers telling me I’m being immature and hurtful. I don’t think so at all."
7,Not the A-hole,AITA for sleeping naked on top of the covers to teach my flatmate's gf a lesson?,47423,d10cpy,6170,"New to reddit, please bare with. So I (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. Up until last week, things were perfect between us. However, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. She and I have quite a lot in common, and I actually like spending time with her. However it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. Now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward I'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. However, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if I want coffee. I sleep naked. Every time prior to the last one, I've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. I always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says ""but I didn't"". When she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, I intentionally slept on top of the covers. Sure enough, she barges in at 7AM, begins to ask if I want coffee and sees my you-know-what. She immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My mate later pulled me aside and said I was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that I'd ""threatened"" to do it before (I literally just said ""okay but what if I had no covers and you saw everything"" before). They're now framing this to others that I'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how I get my rocks off, and I'm kinda seeing how it came off that way. AITA for doing this?"
8,Not the A-hole,AITA for despising my mentally handicap sister?,46794,awyi8k,2723,"The title makes me sound horrible but hear me out.My sister is severely autistic. She requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. She is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. Despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.I hate her. That should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.I was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. Even since I can remember the world has revolved around her. I was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. All of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when I complained. Even when I was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me I was in the wrong.Along with this I am expected to take care of her and drop everything I do for her. I can never make plans with friend because my parents ""expect"" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. Even when I do somehow get time to myself I am required to leave if they need me. If i do not then I am punished. The recent example of this is when I went to see the new spider man movie, and was ""grounded"" because i turned my phone off in the theater.It seems as if I am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. This last week I was chosen to give a speech at a school event. I was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. Anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.I've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. While talking about colleges with my father, he joked that I should get a degree that pays well so when their gone I can take care of my sister. I don't know why but this caused me to break down. I cried and screamed about how it always about her. I'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that I'm expected to be her ""slave"" for the rest of my life.I've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. Am i the asshole here?Edit/Update kinda:Wow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. I never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. Thank you all. After thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that I don't despise my sister. It's not her fault that she was born the way she is. My parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but I was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. They have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. My parents want to talk to me but we have decided it's best I leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue. Thank you all again for the love and support through this <3I'll send an update your guy's way later this week if people are interested. "
9,Not the A-hole,AITA for switching to regular milk to prove my lactose intolerant roommate keeps stealing from me?,46199,hvcvtt,1429,"Me and 2 other guys share an apartment together and we split all the bills. The only thing we don’t split costs on is groceries. Everyone’s in charge of buying their own food and we don’t touch whatever doesn’t belong to us in the fridge. We put our names on everything so no one gets mixed up. This issue has been going on almost a year and I’m sick of it. One of my roommates, R, keeps stealing my food. I get home from work and containers with my leftovers are sometimes missing (they have my name written on it), or my stuff finishes too quick. My gallon of milk for example. I buy almond milk because I like the taste. But it seems to finish after a week even though I’ve only drank once or twice. I confronted R about this lots of times and that’s caused a lot of arguments. He outright denies it and tells me I’m crazy even though it’s so obvious. My other roommate and I carpool together because we both work the same early morning shifts around the same area so I know it’s not him. It’s always after we get back home and R’s already left for work that I notice my food’s gone. My roommate’s also had a similar problem but not as often as I do. I’m guessing cause R doesn’t like what he buys.The funny thing is R buys a lot for himself and is even more stingy about his food. He will literally point out what’s his when he comes back from grocery shopping and tells us not to touch it.Last week, my milk was nearly empty again and I got fed up. I went to the liquor store and bought regular dairy milk. I drank what was left of my almond milk and refilled the gallon with the one I bought. This was to catch/prove R is the one stealing since he’s lactose intolerant. The nxt day, Saturday, we get back from work and R is pissed. He yelled at me that he was stuck in the bathroom for 40 mins with diarrhea because of my milk he was using it to make a shake. I only responded with “So then you’re the one who’s been stealing?” He freaking exploded. Yeah he admitted he was “sometimes” drinking my milk and eating my food but he was more mad that I switched milks than the fact that he was caught. I told him I wouldn’t have done that if he’d just stopped taking my stuff from the fridge or at least told the truth instead of tryna make it seem like I was making it up.My roommate backed me up and thought it was kinda funny he got payback for stealing from us. It’s a little tense rn and my roommate told me R is trying to convince him to agree to kick me out. Little does he know we’re both looking to move somewhere else together cause we are sick of his shit.  I told some buddies what happened and a few think I was an asshole for that. I feel like I’m not in the wrong here. He was taking my food and not even owning up to it and I wanted to prove it, does that make me TA?"
10,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my girlfriend to shut the fuck up after she insulted my sisters thighs?,46097,fzvxw7,2239,"I’m 30 and my 12 year old sister is living with me right now because mom and pops are vulnerable so it made more sense for me to care for my sis for the time being. She is a really great kid and tbh I feel in a lot of ways like she’s my own kid because my mom and dad don’t speak English so I kind of had to raise my sis in ways that they couldn’t. Hard to explain but I’m sure anyone with a secondary culture will get what I mean- my mom and dad are great parents but having an English speaking person to guide you through shit when you live in an English speaking country is invaluable imo and my sister trusts me with stuff she won’t necessarily trust my parents with. Anyway my girlfriend was FaceTiming me and my sister walked past in shorts and a t shirt cuz it’s hot. My ~~sister~~ gf waited til my sister had left the area ( but not the room) and made a face and said ‘maybe feed her less OP, her thighs are kinda chunky’ I saw red and told her to shut the fuck up (just came out my mouth) and immediately ended the call. My sister is a bit chubby but ffs who says stuff like that about a 12 year old girl. Literally. Everybody. I. Know. Has been texting me that I’m a POS boyfriend and that how can I disrespect my gf like that. I am expecting an apology from HER but to my shock everybody is expecting ME to apologize. So Reddit, AITA?"
11,Not the A-hole,AITA for giving my ex wife a large amount of money I won despite the anger of my gf?,45407,b43t53,5437,"I recently won a ‘fuck you’ amount of money. I won’t say exactly how much but it’s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It’s enough to change the life of myself and my family. My ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. She was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She’s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I’m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven’t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. Long story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I’m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I’m not *in* love with her. We’ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I’m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don’t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?"
12,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling coworkers extremely bluntly why I'm not participating in the office weight loss bet?,44490,jhwisp,3255,"Someone got the brilliant idea to make an office diet bet due to COVID gains, with people pooling in their money to see who can lose the most weight by Thanksgiving. I am one of 7 people not participating. Lots of preggos, some bodybuilders, and people who maintained their weight who aren't interested. Since I've visibly gained, they thought I'd want to participate. I didn't. Jen, in charge of everything, kept dropping by to remind me to turn in my form and my money.I  said ""No thanks."" Jen wouldn't drop it. Other people got involved, asking me why not all the time, it'll be fun! Don't be scared, I'd ""feel better"" and ""look better"" (I told them no, I wouldn't) and it's a great way to bond, we're all in it together, it's like Weight Watchers!""I'm not interested,"" and then eventually, ""I. Said. No. Drop it."" They decided I wanted them to convince me. Two weeks into the bet, they tried to trick on the scale to ""shock"" me. I contacted HR, people finally backed down. I'm eating my food one day (rice and beans), people sitting with me start dropping hints that how they feel so much better now that they aren't eating carby comfort food all the time. I said ""I'm glad you feel better.""They took this as a sign that I ""knew"" I'd ""feel better"" again and started up saying I could still join in. I finally fucking snapped and said ""You guys suck. I'm a recovering anorexic. I get one whiff of competition and start starving myself for days and start puking up what I do eat until I'd have to get my third oral surgery to remove rotting teeth. Does that sound worth it to you?""Chorus of ""wow"" and ""we were just joking.""I said ""No, you weren't *just joking*. Congratulations, by the way. After you all wouldn't stop, I weighed myself for the first time in seven years and didn't eat for two days. Does that make you all *feel good*?""None of them would look me in the eye, so I just went home for the day. I got a call from the women in HR, who were shockingly supportive of me. One of the bodybuilder guys stepped up and said he's witnessed a lot of the harassment and he doesn't blame me for my outburst. A few others did too. However, they had to cancel the diet bet (I didn't ask them to) and people are blaming me. Saying that I can't take a joke, it wasn't ""that deep"" and the girls present said they no longer feel ""safe"" working with me because I obviously have mental issues. One of them made a big stink about ""politically correct bullshit"" and how I'm the typical hypersensitive milennial. I go back and forth on this all day, thinking I should have just swallowed my anger and gone back to HR or just stopped eating lunch in the office or whatever. I didn't mean to ruin anyone's fun but I also feel justified in pushing back on their harassment.AITA?"
13,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling the girl who kissed my boyfriend for a play that she is desperate and pathetic?,44256,dtg4jw,4302,"I (19f) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend is on the same course. My boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. He gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. I'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.However, there's one girl in our class, let's call her Victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. She goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. I know this is the case, because I've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.I've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and I don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. However, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. I rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. She was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him I was there too.Victoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. I snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. You're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'She looked super embarrassed and walked away, and I later heard she'd gone home crying. I feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. AITA?Edit: She 100% knows that I am his girlfriend, I have heard her talking about me being his girlfriend before."
14,Not the A-hole,AITA for jumping out of a bathroom window to avoid my mom’s attempt at forcing a reunion between me and my ex fiancé?,43709,efcc8u,1756,"Some backstory: I had been dating my ex fiancé Sarah for four years. We had been planning to get married in November 2020 but I found out at the start of this month that she cheated on me. She begged me to give her another chance but I broke it off. The problem was that being cheated on is, in my mind, completely emasculating and humiliating. So I never told anyone that was the reason we broke up. For obvious reasons, Sarah also didn’t tell people we broke up because she cheated. So people have “blamed” me for the breakup, including my mom. They just see that I dumped her out of the blue. I’ve gone very strict no contact with Sarah after I discovered she was cheating on me. Sarah has been talking with my mom and has convinced her that if we could talk one more time, we would be able to reconcile. My mom has been applying hard core pressure on me to talk with Sarah but I’ve explained that there’s no chance we will ever get back together. So tonight I go over to my mom’s place because she’s hosting family for Christmas Eve. I’m there for a bit talking with my aunts and uncles and cousins when the doorbell rings and I can see it’s Sarah. I ask wtf is going on and my mom says she invited Sarah so we can work this out in the spirit of the holidays. I’m pissed now because the only way to explain my side of the story is to tell everyone I was cheated on. Complete humiliation in front of my whole family. So as my mom goes to the front door, I go into the bathroom. My mom starts knocking on the door saying that I need to come out and talk to my ex like an adult. I say fuck it, kick out the window screen and get in my car and go home. My mom called a short while ago saying she’s cutting ties with me over my behavior (she’s really fixated on me jumping out of a window) and that Sarah will always be like a child to her. My sister called me after to ream me out for ruining Christmas. I broke down and told her that Sarah cheated on me which is why I dumped her and didn’t want to see her under any circumstances. She called me a big asshole who was lying to cover for myself.  Am I really in the wrong?"
15,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my brother not to bring his boyfriend to my wedding?,43070,cs0bfh,4534,"Ok this is the worst. I’m losing sleep over this.I’m getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and I cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.My brother is gay, but my family doesn’t know, only me and my parents know. I come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century’s mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.So my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, I’m so happy my brother found a great guy. But it’s kind of a secret, as he hasn’t told my family he is gay.I’ve been telling him for years that he should come out, cause I know it stresses him a lot, and I think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus I bet a few family members already know anyway.But he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won’t accept it and it will be a lot of drama. I see the opposite, I see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. I have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn’t accept my brother being gay.Anyway, that’s his decision not mine, so for now he won’t say anything.Until a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. I was not expecting that to be honest. So he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.If it was any other occasion I would be supportive obviously, but I don’t think my wedding day is the day to do that.  Imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. And I don’t want to get the attention away from my fiancée, that’s her day. And I dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and I think it’s a pretty good reasonI asked him why my wedding day, he said it’s because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. This is killing me. I would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if I had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and I can’t do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. I didn’t even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worseWith a heavy heart, I asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that I hope he understands me. He  started crying and left my house without saying anything.Next day I got a text and he said “ dont worry, going alone”. I tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don’t seem to know what’s happening because they didn’t say anything.He eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between usThis is the worst situation of my life, am I the asshole for handling it the way I did?PS 1: I wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!PS 2: Thanks for the gold and stuff!Update: spoke to fiancée, couldn’t keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.Clarification: I know it won’t be my brother that would cause trouble. The trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. Doesn’t matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.I don’t want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. Literally every other day of my life I will support my brother’s decision to come out. Even at the wedding, I would obviously defend him. But the point is, NOT AT THE WEDDING. Also, MY BROTHER IS NOT THE ASSHOLE. Not at all."
16,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling a social worker the real reason my sister wants a foster kid?,42233,hsdpho,2113,"So this is a throw away account. While my sister doesn't use reddit, we have mutual friends who do.I'm a 28F and I have a sister (36F) For the sake of story, I'll just call Jane. Jane is married to ""Bob"" and they have two kids, boy and a girl. My niece and nephew are wonderful kids and no trouble at all. They fight as siblings do but nothing big. I love them. Now for about two years, I did live with my sister. It was a miserable time that really effected our relationship. She saw me as free labor, money and babysitting. Even when I managed to get a small part time job, she demanded I hand over nearly half my pay or get out. It was hell as she took completely advantage of me. I moved out as soon as I could and we have little contact outside of family gatherings.Now after I moved out, she started complaining how ""She has no help with the kids and never gets a break!"" I babysit sometimes but I have made it clear, just cause I am off work, doesn't mean I want an 8 hour day with my niece and nephew.Anyway she started talking about how she wanted to foster a kid. Not a kid but a teenager. I pressed her for more info on this. She wants to adopt a teenager so she has a live in babysitter for her kids. This is her logic: ""I want a kid around 16 or 17, you know someone who may have been in the system for awhile. They can share a room with your nephew (she only has a three 3 bedroom house) or sleep in the garage. They can help me with house work, chores, cook and help me with my business.(She bakes and sells cookies) Also babysit the kids so me and Bob can go out sometimes or have some alone time. They'll be so grateful for a home and won't complain. I won't have to pay them at all. And then when they turn 18, I can just sign up for another foster kid! A teenager will be so much easier than a little kid, they will be grateful just to have a roof, food, siblings if they have been separated from their real ones and clothes.""I was horrified! Told her it was a horrible idea! She didn't listen to me. She went on with it anyway. About a month ago, a social worker showed up at my apartment to ask me some questions about my sister. She had put me down as a character witness or something like that. I immediately told the social worker why my sister really wanted to foster a kid and how she treated me when I lived with her. The lady thanked me.My sister called crying saying that she wouldn't be considered for any adoptions or fosters. The social worker told her that they felt her home and her weren't a good fit. She asked if I said anything and I told the truth. She went off on me, hung up and we haven't spoken since. She has sent some angry texts. A couple family members are on her side. They think foster kids are fucking dogs or something and would be so happy just to have a roof and would gladly do all the housework.So AITA here?Edit: So wow! I didn't know my post blew up like this till I got home from work! Thank you everyone for the kind words, messages and awards.  Remember no child is in control of the circumstances that may have landed them in the foster care system.  They are children and still human. They deserve a loving home and care.  Do right by a foster kid. And thank you again.  Feel free to message me or chat if you like. "
17,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking moms boyfriend to stop trying to parent me?,41631,cwxh47,4444,"**EDIT: THE BOYFRIEND DOESNT LIVE WITH US AND DOESNT PAY RENT OR BILLS. HIM AND HIS DAUGHTES SPEND TIME HERE AND PAY ONLY FOR THEIR FOOD: SOMETHING I DO AS WELL*** My dad died suddenly about a year ago, and my mom found this really nice guy that she’s started seeing. I’m 23M and going into my final year of college. My moms boyfriend has two daughters ages 15 and 13. My mom has stepped in to be a mother figure to them, and the boyfriend has stepped into my extended family becoming everyone’s favourite uncle. And while i’m glad everyone else is comfortable, i’m not. He isn’t a bad guy, I’m just still grieving my father, and it feels like he’s trying to replace him. He tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn’t because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. Boyfriend thinks it’s only fair because i have siblings now. I think it’s ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. He’s trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. They aren’t lacking for anything but he thinks it’s only fair because ~family~. I live in the basement of my moms house. I have since i was 15. When you come in the front door there’s a door to the basement and the stairs to go into the house. So it’s pretty separate. So last night i was DDing for some friends and got home at 2 am. I had nothing to do until 3pm today since classes aren’t until next week and my new job starts in 2 weeks. So this has never been a big deal with my parents. I shot my mom a text and went to bed. Tonight though, man, boyfriend flipped. I got a lecture and sent to my room and “possible loss of car privileges.”I snapped and laid it out for him. I told him i’m leaving the city after i graduate, i told him i’m glad my mom found a new partner but that i am not and will not be looking for a new father figure and he needs to respect that. I told him our relationship won’t be father/son for some time, and that he needs to respect me as an adult or that i won’t want to have a relationship with him. He told my family and they think i’m the asshole. AITA?"
18,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling my Dad he isn't getting the inheritance he's expecting?,41570,dgfkt3,3304,"My mother died when I was 16. My dad married another woman two years later.My grandparents, my dad's parents, HATE my stepmother. I really don't like her either.Even after my half-siblings were born, my grandparents never warmed up to her.My grandparents are quite wealthy. My father has been banking on this inheritance for a while. He has even been not paying into his retirement because he's so sure that he will inherit the millions.I just found out on Saturday that I'm getting the majority of my grandparents estate. My father is getting a token amount of $50000 so he can't dispute it.My grandparents made me promise not to give out any money after and I intend to keep  my word.But I do feel really guilty that my father just spends his money as it's coming in because he's relying on money he won't get.I also found out my dad is in a lot of debt.AITA for not telling him?"
19,Not the A-hole,AITA for keeping my website up after being asked to remove it?,41418,cbybhq,2330,"**UPDATED 7:50 PM:** Holy crap! Thank you for the outpour of support, everyone. I never thought posting this in an online community was going to reach the right eyes so quickly! I had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when I checked back in after work. Several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on Reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. Apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.My intent was to answer more questions since I wasn't able to do that while at work. I was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however I've been told not to continue further discussions beyond what I have already posted if I wish to pursue a civil suit.Just a couple things I want to address in my update here. Some people are saying I'm leaving out details. My original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. I had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so I apologize if it looks like details have been left out. I did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept. Lastly, my son is now back with me. There was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we're together now and that's what counts.I'm sorry if I didn't respond to your comment or private message. I'm still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read. Truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, words of encouragement, and advice that you sent my way. I can't even begin to put into words how grateful I am. Again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.\---------------------------------------------Back in November 2018 I was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. It was the most humiliating thing I've ever experienced. I later learned at the police station that I was being charged with multiple felonies. This came as a huge surprise. Luckily I was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. For $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, I was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. However it cost me everything and I was unable to pay my bond. This resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. At a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and I ended up having all my charges dismissed. When I finally got out I learned that I had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. His mother is a heroine addict and I haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. They wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.Since my release, I've learned that I can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that I was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. I've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. They took down my info but never followed up. So what I did was create a website sharing my story. I also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. Literally the only reason why I was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. If the detective had done his job, he could have verified that I wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. This is what pisses me off the most. My life was ruined because of a lazy employee.I'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. I live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. My web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. I received a cease and desist letter recently, which I showed to my attorney. He said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything I had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. Yesterday I received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. He apologized, stating ""mistakes can happen."" They then talked to me about my website and asked if I could remove it. I said I would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. Suffice to say that isn't happening.After the visit I received, I'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. I don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. My friends think I'm being spiteful and have suggested that I just delete it. AITA for keeping my website up?Edit: Grammar"
20,Not the A-hole,AITA for ruining both my parents marriages for disowning me?,41040,cohdqj,2352,"I am the  by-product of my parents extra-marital affair. Both of them had spouses at the time. My birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when I was conceived so there was no way I was his. A few months after I was born they decided not to divorce. I was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.Both my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that I am adopted by my grandparents. Recently I decided that I wanted to know more about my dad's family and I sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so I could get to know him. Well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over Skype. They both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. Well I did pretty much the opposite. I contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. She is now divorcing him while on my mother's side I told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother. Currently my siblings on both sides lives have been upturned and after the satisfaction has worn off I feel like I unnecessarily hurt them through my parents. AITA for ruining my parents marriages?"
21,Not the A-hole,Aita for telling my brother he got exactly what he deserved when he pushed his girlfriend away for being a “gold digger”?,41030,jms4y3,2868,"My brother is a very hardworking man and at 27 he is now very wealthy and doing well for himself. He’s been with this girl for six months and throughout the time we have gotten close because we both like hair, makeup, and shopping. I never knew there was anything wrong with their relationship except when she texted me last week I saying she would love to hang out but thinks it’ll be inappropriate because her and my brother broke up. I asked her why and she said she was sick and tired of “auditioning” to prove she was with him for the right reasons. She went on to say that my brother is paranoid she’s after his money so he would test her like 1. Leaving out his bank statements on their bed and getting upset when she picked it up 2. Going out to eat at high end restaurants he requested and leaving his wallet on home at purpose to make her pay the bill and prove she’s not going out with him for money 3. Never buying her gifts and questioning her when she asks why he doesn’t. I was shocked so I had to hear my brothers perspective. We spoke and he told me everything she said was true and that there’s nothing wrong with making sure his girlfriend is with him for the right reasons. He said he left his bank statements on the bed and was peeking through the door to see if she would be curious and when he saw her pick up the papers he knew in his gut she was using him for his money, so he set up the restaurant idea to see if she would get upset at paying a 500$ bill which she was. I asked him if he thinks her being an elementary school teacher could’ve contributed to her being upset at a 500$ bill at a restaurant he wanted to go to and he said no. He said the straw that broke was when she asked him why he hasn’t bought her a single gift since they’ve started dating when she bought him a gaming console and new rims for his car and he knew she was just discretely asking him to buy her an expensive gift. He confronted her and said he thinks she’s with him for his money so she said let me do us both a favor and dumped him and blocked him. He’s upset about the “gold digging bitch” and when I laughed he called me an asshole. He said I would never understand what’s it’s like being a rich man and being used and I get that concern, but I told him if he thinks any woman will be okay with his tests and auditions he’s delusional as hell. If he doesn’t want to be used for his money he should start dating people as wealthy as him or leave lower income people alone if he’s not going to be genuine in his relationships unless they pass his “test”."
22,Not the A-hole,AITA for shouting at my ex in front of my daughters?,40990,htmhgb,2336,"I (37M) have three girls 8, 10, and 12. Their mother walked out on us for another man when our youngest was around 4. My ex still stays in contact, though, and pays child support.A few weeks ago while doing laundry, I saw red spots on my oldest's underwear. I asked her if she knew about it, and she cried and told me she tried to call her mom, but my ex didn't call back. She'd been stuffing toilet paper in her underwear, hoping that would work. I explained to her that periods are nothing to be ashamed of, and found some great resources online for us to review together. I took her to the store to pick out brands of feminine products she wanted to use (she picked Playtex Sport because she's a gymnast). After we were done, I decided I should do the same thing with my other two. My 12yo volunteered to be part of preparing them, and we made a whole night of it it was wonderful, and I learned a lot. I even learned what a menstrual cup is, and how they benefit the environment.The other day, my ex called back. I'll usually arrange a video chat and leave the room so they can have some alone time, and when they're done chatting, I'll come back in to talk boring co-parenting stuff like school, bills, etc. This last time, my ex was FURIOUS with me for talking about periods with the girls. She shouted at me that I was sick and perverted, why didn't I call her myself if I knew it was so urgent, I could've called one of their grandmas/aunts, but my mom has dementia, while her mom and sisters call me a loser because I teach kindergarten, so I'm not fond of them.My ex told me I was being immature and should have just toughed it out for the girls. This really pissed me off, so I shouted back that maybe if she wasn't such a deadbeat and answered her goddamned phone once in a while, she could have handled this. I brought up everything she does that hurts them she hasn't been to a single soccer game, piano recital, or gymnastics meet in two years, every other weekend when they come home from her house, they go straight to their rooms, only to emerge hours later asking me why she loves her new husband more than them, and what did they do to make her leave. My ex responded by saying I should tell them it's not their fault I couldn't satisfy her, and I screamed ""fuck you"", and she just smirked and pointed behind me, saying ""Look what you did""When I turned around, my 8yo and 10yo were standing in the doorway crying. It broke my heart I never shout, so I know I scared them. My 12yo stormed in and started screaming at her mom, and while I appreciate her sticking up for me, this is not a battle I want her fighting. My ex hung up before I could fully deescalate the situation, and let's just say the girls have been given free reign of the ice cream and limitless hours of video games, because I feel so bad. I even watched all the Twilight movies with them, so don't say I don't love them. But in this instance, AITA for shouting?"
23,Not the A-hole,AITA for saying my babysitting rates are $35 an hour?,40709,eizcvf,8956,"I'm a software engineer, with a full time job and a side hustle of doing freelance coding work in my own time. I've always been the type to have a side hustle I put a lot of my free time into I get really bored sitting idle.My freelance hourly rates are $60 an hour, and at my full time job, my hourly pay works out to about $40 an hour. So that's how I value my time. Anyway, over Christmas vacation, I was staying at my parents house. My cousin was also staying over with her three young kids from Christmas to new year's.I'd been planning on doing some work on my freelance projects when I had free time in the mornings when my family had no plans. I wasn't in any rush I was already ahead of schedule on them all, but I didn't really have anything else to do. It was in a really rural area and it's like an hour drive to the nearest anythingThen my cousin and her husband asked if I could babysit all day for three days, so they could visit some friends in the area and hang out with just adults. I said I had planned on doing freelance work at the library, and she offered to pay me to babysit.I said I could if they got close to my freelance rates. She wanted a number, and although my freelance rates are $60 I didn't feel like that was right, it was high. But I didn't want to go too low honestly babysitting 3 kids would be harder for me than the routine coding work I had for my freelance project. I don't know a lot about kids and I've never babysat for long, and I had a feeling it would be stressful and difficult.So I said $35, which is below what I make hourly at work, and what is the bare minimum I'd value my time for, if that time is spent doing difficult work. And she went crazy at me, saying that's a ridiculous rate for babysitting, that I was entitled and being selfish, that I'm trying to take advantage of how she didn't have other options, etc.I said that's way below what I'd be making if I had the time to do my own work, and I'd be putting off my own work to babysit. Her husband then got mad at me saying that I was a 24 year old girl, that I'm damn near a child myself, that my time is not worth that much and it's childish to say that it was. And that I was a stupid girl for not knowing that babysitting costs like 15 an hour, when I grew up and have kids of my own I will see how stupid I was being.I was kind of done with being called stupid so I just told them I hoped they could find someone else.My mom thinks that I asked for something offensive, and my cousin and her husband obviously did too.AITA for giving that number?"
24,Not the A-hole,AITA for making fun of a white girl for being poor because she was being racist?,39634,icmq68,2161,"I’m Asian, more specifically one of the only Chinese people in my grade, which has been absolutely fun these days. So the girl in question, has been racially harassing me since the beginning of lockdown, when she dmed and said “did the bat taste good? thanks a lot you fucking freak”. I reported her to my school, and they literally just dropped it because they said tensions were high, and she couldn’t be blamed because her uncle had corona, some BS like that. Then I got repeated messages like that from fake/newly created accounts, that I suspect were from her, and I just kept blocking them until I guess she gave up because I wasn’t reacting. My school district has chosen to do in person, massively dumb imo, but whatever. On the literal second day of school, she walks up to me while I’m in the lunch line and says in a thick asian accent, “Are you eating bat dumpring or dog noodle?” Other people around me fucking laughed, and I’m sure I don’t have to explain this, but I felt fucking humiliated. It finally felt like I got her off my back for a little while, and she comes back as soon as school starts, and I already know my school administration isn’t going to go to bat for me. I don’t know a lot about this girl, since obviously I try to avoid her, but I did know that she had shitty teeth, lived in a trailer, and was very poor. I’m ashamed to have stooped to this, but I just wanted to show her how I felt for once, so I said, “I’d be less concerned with what I’m eating if I were you, and more worried about your diet, since you’re the one who needs to figure out how to brush her teeth in a trailer with no running water. Stop trying to get sent to a hospital when you can’t afford healthcare.” Other students nearby told me I went too far because “it wasn’t her fault she was poor” LIKE IT WAS MY FAULT I WAS ASIAN?!?! She literally fucking cried, like I didn’t cry everytime she called me a fucking chink. She’s left me alone ever since though, which doesn’t matter since I plan on transferring anyways."
25,Not the A-hole,AITA for taking back the beer I bought for a party from which I was uninvited?,39369,hd12gs,1798,"This happened just a few hours ago. I am a 19 year old man and the people calling me an asshole are 18 year old men and women. On Thursday, a person I had a major crush on in high school (but who rejected me) messaged me out of the blue. She had never contacted me without my contacting her first, and at one point I realized she had had me blocked on social media, and so I found it odd that she was suddenly being friendly. After sending a couple of greetings/questions about how I've been, she said that she was going to have some people over and wanted to know if I would get the beer. The drinking age where we are is 19, and she and the people who were going to chill were all 18. The liquor stores in my area all card.I thought it was silly that my being a month older meant I could buy liquor and they couldn't, and so I said I would love to go. She said ""thanks, I'll pick you up at seven!""7 o'clock rolled around, and she texted me to say she was in front of my house. I went out dressed and ready to chill with some people, and she drove me to the liquor store. When we got there, I asked what beer she wanted me to get, and she told me to get Budweiser. I hid my disappointment as well as I could, but it was her party so I went in and bought two cases of 24. I got back in the car and said ""let's party,"" and she was eerily quiet. I noticed that she wasn't driving towards her neighborhood, but rather back towards mine. I thought she had moved or something, but didn't want to press the issue. When she turned down my street I finally figured it out. She was being purposefully vague about the invitation because she wanted me to get the beer, but she wanted a way out when she told me I wasn't actually invited in the first place.She stopped in front of my house, leaned over, kissed me on the cheek, and said ""thanks!"" in her best voice. I deadpanned her and asked when she was going to tell me I wasn't invited. She feigned surprise and said that she never intended to invite me in the first place. I sat in silence for a long awkward minute, picked up the beer, and walked towards my front door. She got out of her car and frantically tried to reinvite me to the party, but I told her that what she did was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. I opened my front door, slammed it a bit too hard, and came back to my room.Now I'm sitting here drinking absolutely unpalatable piss water, and I have text messages from all of her friends and her asking me why I'm being such a dick. I don't think I'm the asshole for reacting the way I did, but if you haven't figured it out I'm not amazing socially so I'm not sure. Am I here?"
26,Not the A-hole,AITA for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does?,39361,d38i34,2863,"Background: I graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. My sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. We both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. I pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.This is a throwaway and it's still fresh and I'm really emotionally charged right now. Last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. I overheard and I offered to help by paying more in rent (I was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. My parents were grateful. Now, prior to this, I never asked my how much sister pays in rent. I always figured my parents charged us the same. So absentmindedly I asked a follow-up question.Me: How much is [my sister] paying [for rent]?My Mom: Nothing.A long ass pause.Me: What do you mean she doesn't pay rent?My Dad (visibly angry): Your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!My dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. She doesn't pay rent. She doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. So for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while I've been paying my parents.So later that night we had a family sit down talk. My sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much I was paying. She offered $100. My parents suggested she pay $300, I pay $800 which my sister and I both rejected.The conversation ended with this:Sister: **FUCK YOU. I'M TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE.** [These were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)So my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. I'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. My mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.So I say my part before leaving.Me: I'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (It's only fair right?) And if I do pay rent, I pay whatever she's being.My mom: What if she pays $300 and you pay $800-Me: No.My mom: But [me], we really need the money...Me: That's too bad.I get up and go off to my room.So this morning my dad comes in tells me that I'M AN ASSHOLE FOR NOT PAYING RENT. That I should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. I'm like, ""what the hell? make [my sister] pay rent!""My mom, who's listening in.""You've seen her! She won't listen to us!""Me: WELL THAT'S TOO BAD.My mom (really angry): WELL WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM IF YOU DIDN'T TRY TO MAKE YOUR SISTER PAY RENT.That was the last straw that blew it for me. I slammed the door on my parents.As I'm typing this my parents are in the living room discussing how both their children are rotten and shit was better back in the home country/back in their day when kids listened to their parents. Like wtf?"
27,Not the A-hole,"AITA for ""making fun"" of a woman for being in her 40s and single?",39171,icvnba,2376,"This whole saga started because my husband took my last name. A couple weeks ago he got his workplace to change it, and his coworkers found out. About half of them think this is the funniest thing ever and about half are deeply offended. Brenda is in the offended half, and has made that clear. He and I are in a group chat with his coworkers where we organize carpooling during the pandemic. It is very helpful to us, so we can't leave the chat. Since he changed his name, my husband and I have been dealing with a lot of dumb jokes in the chat, which we have been mostly ignoring. Yesterday Brenda, his coworker and I got into a bit of a spat. I messaged the group asking if someone could take my husband home since I wouldn't be back from work until late and needed the car. One of his other coworkers agreed, and I thought that was that. Brenda messages the group saying ""maybe if you spent less time at work and more time being a wife, your husband wouldn't come into work with dirty shirts"" I took this as a bad joke initially. My husband is a rural mail carrier, so his shirts look like shirts worn by someone in 90 degree heat on dusty roads. I do wash them, but there's only so much to be done. Me: I could make cleaning those shirts my full-time job and it wouldn't do much lolBrenda: you won't be married very long if you keep trying to be the man in the relationship. I'd be embarrassed as a wife if I did so little for my husbandMe: well I work more hours and pay the bills, so I think he can oxyclean his own shirts if it's so importantBrenda: maybe you should learn to take proper care of your husband or you'll find yourself divorced. Me: I'll let you know when I need relationship advice from someone who is 42 and singleNow apparently Brenda is going around and saying that I ""mocked her for being single in her 40s"". I don't care if someone is single in their 40s, but I think it's absolute bullshit that she can call me a bad wife but I can't point out she has no frame of reference. AITA reddit?Edit: people keep asking why I need to help arrange rides in the first place. When my husband is out on deliveries he rarely has cell service, so if I find out late that I'm going to be home late I need to be able to reach his coworkers directly. Multiple spouses are in the chat for the same reasons.Edit 2: people are saying that I've hurt my husband's feelings by saying I pay the bills. After reading the exchange he sent me a text saying ""sometimes I forget you're a hard little bitch who takes no prisoners. I'm so proud lol."" He's fine, I asked him just now if my comment about the bills hurt him and he said ""oh yeah, it's so hard having a hot wife who makes good money. Really tough, pray for me."""
28,Not the A-hole,"UPDATE: AITA if I ""cancel"" Christmas because I can't afford it this year?",38937,e8w7e6,874," Previous Post: [\_if\_i\_cancel\_christmas\_because\_i\_cant\_afford/]( So, it's been 2 weeks and somehow the messages are still coming in.  Thankfully the offers of charity have stopped (here's hoping they were redirected to their communities) but a good deal of them asking whether or not I stopped being a grinch and started being a good husband and father again.  So, to get those people placated first, here you go:  I DECORATED.  Pics without our faces only, sorry.  []([]([]( also spoke with a financial advisor, who is helping me set up a budget for 2020, and a counselor who helped me realize that I was worth more than the goods I could offer someone.  She recommended 2 separate therapists to me, and neither are taking new patients before the new year, so for now, my wife and I are working on our budget and cleaning out various corners of the house for things to sell.  So far, we've gotten rid of some unused basement furniture, a mini fridge that has been empty for 2 years, a bunch of wine racks and paraphernalia (we don't drink at home since the baby was born 2 years ago, so no need to keep it around) as well as some other things and made about $750, more than enough to pay all the overdue bills, put some money in savings, and groceries in the cupboard.  It's going to be a long road to pay off this cc debt, but we're finally addressing the issue head on and moving in the right direction.Since my last paycheck (that covered mortgage and utilities, no worries there, for those who asked if I was behind, thank you) I have also been offered (and taken) 3 DJ gigs for Holiday parties.  2 for personal friends/acquaintances businesses, 1 for a charity.  I refused payment for the children's charity gig, instead offering to give the money right back to the kids instead, which was gratefully accepted by the organizer.  The extra cash from the 2 paying gigs paid down some more debt, and was enough leftover to allow me to have bought some nice new books and a Moana doll for my little girl to open on Xmas morning, (to say nothing of the bags of presents from both sets of grandparents full of clothes and toys, so she'll be fine from a presents standpoint).Inspired by everyone's offers of charity, I volunteered again at Paul's Place in Baltimore, where this time I donned the hairnet and apron and served hot meals.  Cell phones are prohibited inside, plus taking photos of yourself doing charity work defeats the purpose of said work.  I also organized a food drive at my office to provide meal kits for Christmas for needy families, and we were able to donate 574 lbs of food to the MD Food Bank!Thank you to all who reached out and made me realize that I really was an asshole.  I let my personal shortcomings almost ruin a holiday for my wife and child.  It won't be as fancy as our last Christmases, but I have a feeling that this year will be very special to me, no matter how little is under my tree.  I realized that I have all the gifts I need, and I cannot thank the beautiful people who offered up so much charity to a grumpy stranger.  I didn't need to accept your gifts to accept your love, and the offers alone changed my life.Happy Holiday's y'all."
29,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling my family that if they gift us money for our wedding, there will be no ""strings attached"" or we will politely decline it?",38694,c8uwj2,3058,"I fucking hate wedding culture.It's bullshit.My fiance and I thought we would escape the bullshit and money by having a small thing. Well, family started trying to throw money at us to make it bigger and more spectacular. We were surprised, but it was a good surprise.Then the demands started coming out. They wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person HAS to be a groomsman, etc etc. Suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion.We put our foot down and said:>Thank you all for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. Unfortunately, it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. When we were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached. With so many requests and so many demands from people we didn't expect would think they had a say in *our* wedding, we have decided to give everyone their money back.   >  >Our understanding of what a gift is must be very different.  >  >If you would like to give us money without strings attached or requests or demands, we will gracefully accept it. But if you believe a gift should come with stipulations, we must regretfully, and politely decline.This has caused an epic shitstorm. Such to the point where I have people saying they will never come to our wedding (honestly, not the worse thing in the world), that we are spoiled, we're assholes, etc etc etc. My parents are rather upset about it, but hers (who never made any demands and gave us a small cash gift) said we did the right thing. We are halfway to canceling the whole party and just absconding into the wilderness to do the wedding the way we want. AITA? (Are We?)"
30,Not the A-hole,AITA because I refuse to go and visit my special needs stepsister in hospital even though she’s very sick? I low key hate her.,38510,d1btlg,4339,"I’m 15 years old. I have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. I’m not sure what’s wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she’s non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. She also doesn’t understand stuff. That’s probably the easiest way to put it. She’s just a human body with nothing inside. She’s my stepmoms daughter. My stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. I don’t know my stepmom very well and I don’t really get on with her. We are respectful to each other but I’m basically living with strangers because she’s so busy with her daughter and my dad. I am always on my own and I used to hate it but I’m used to it now.Ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. That’s fine, I get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that I don’t want to do and I resent doing. Stuff like staying home when I want to go to the mall with my friends, they’re disappointed that I don’t get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. My own mom passed away when I was small so I can’t go and stay anywhere else and all in all I’m just a lot more angry than I used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever I say I don’t want to do anything for her. Even stuff like feeding her- like- I don’t want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. I didn’t ask for this. Anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. She was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. I don’t want to go and visit her. I remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and I just hate hospitals and I sort of hate my stepsister and I just don’t want to go and visit someone who doesn’t even know I’m there. My stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. They haven’t yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because I don’t want to visit. My grandma who lives in Canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and I don’t need to force myself to go to the hospital so I’m assuming my dad has told her I’m refusing to go. He keeps pleading with me but I keep telling him I’m not doing it. I told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and I need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom. I just want to know what Reddit thinks because half my friends think I should go and the other half think I’m justified in saying no."
31,Not the A-hole,AITA For Barring My Husband From The Bedroom Tonight?,38412,hxm71l,2335,"So here is the situation.Me: nurse. Working 50ish hours a week in paediatric ICU. Cry at least once a week because that shit is hard. My salary pays our bills. All of them. Husband: 25M. Has a degree but isn't looking for a job. Works 2 days a week at the grocery store. Spends most of his time playing LoL. Btw all events here are in accordance with Covid Legislation. Today was supposed to be A Good Day. I had been begging my husband to swap his Saturday shift to literally anything else so that we could have days off together. We haven't had a weekend together since our wedding, 18mo ago. Today was supposed to be our first Saturday off together. We were going to go to an animal sanctuary.He starts the day by going to breakfast. With his best mate. Leaving before I even wake up. I wake up around 9 and realise he is not home. Call. He says he's helping his mate set up some lights and that the weather is too rainy for the animal sanctuary anyway. He gets home at 1ish. Lies around. Plays some video games, promising we would cook dinner together tonight.Leaves again at 5 to help the same mate with something else. I go grocery shopping. I don't drive because of medical issues, but I walk there and back in the rain. I get home, realise I've left my keys inside. Call husband, knowing he's 5min away. He says he will leave in a minute. I sit in the rain and the cold (southern hemisphere). 45 min later, I call again. He hasn't left yet. He finally agrees to come and let me in the house, so he drives up, presses the clicker to let me in the garage and leaves again. At 10, I I called to see where he is. His friend answers. Says he is driving out to do something an hour away. It's 10.30. I am going to bed. I have sent him a txt that I am upset and don't want to speak to him tonight and would rather he left me alone. As far as I am concerned, if he can't value me more than his best mate on the first day off he and I have shared in a year and a half, he can go sleep in his bed instead. (Btw, his friend doesn't work, so they hang out all the time when I am at work). He is going to be upset. And he is gonna tell his mate and his mate is going to tell him I'm being a bitch. AITAAdding some info: I am 26. We weren't always like this. I don't know what changed. I'm fairly confident he's not having an affair. And I fully intend on talking this through, but at a time that isn't 4am. Also the crying: sick babies sometimes make me sad, and I love all my patients. That's why I cry. And I don't mean hours of sobbing. I mean stepping into a supply closet to take a moment before getting back to work. Also thank you for your kindness. I was expecting maybe 5 replies. I am trying to respond as much as I can. But there are a lot of you."
32,Not the A-hole,AITA for not waking up my girlfriend for her exam after I overheard her calling me a little bitch?,38352,gth6bg,1669,"My girlfriend has online summer courses and she had an exam for one of them this morning. I usually wake her up for pretty much everything because she sleeps through her phone alarm no matter how long it buzzes or how many she sets. She has joked that I’m her butler before and within the context of a relationship it’s ok so I didn’t mind, obviously I want to love my partner and try make her life easy. However last night she was chatting with her friends and she thought I couldn’t hear. She was bragging that I’m her little bitch and I do everything for her when she tells me to, etc. It really hurt my feelings because they were making comments like ‘good, put him in his place’ and she was agreeing. She specifically said ‘yeah I’m not worried about tomorrow because the bitch will make sure I’m up and he’ll probably have breakfast ready for me too’ I went to bed pretty hurt by it, and come morning I didn’t bother to wake her up when her alarm started to go. She usually only gets up when someone physically shakes her, but I let her turn off her alarm and she slipped back into sleep and I turned around and went back to sleep too. When she woke up she was yelling at me saying I’m an asshole and I’ve cost her her exam and I’m a piece of shit for what I did.EDIT: sorry for not responding sooner I wrote this up on my break at work and now I have to get back to it (can’t have my phone, work with food) I wasn’t expecting this many replies so fast. I think we’re breaking up. I told her this morning after she called me a ‘bitch’ for being upset re being called a bitch, lol, but she says she’s not done with me. I’m just trying to get through today’s shift and then deal with stuff later. I’ll try and get back as I can. We’ve been together a year and it was my first real relationship but I’m tired of her not acknowledging how shitty she made me feel and still calling me a bitch. That word is really making me feel shit and small."
33,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my wife’s friend she is too old and ugly after she repeatedly asked my 19-year-old son to take off his shirt? He was getting uncomfortable.,38061,hzjbhx,1332,"My family had a small get together at my house. One of my wife’s friends was over (she is unmarried I think she is 45-47)? We aren’t too close to her since she lives pretty far away. She was over our house and she started complimenting my son (my son is 19). It starts off innocent but as time goes on it gets more and more crossing the line. When we were out on my deck she starts telling my son to take his shirt off, 'whats the point of going to the gym if no one will see it.' My son is visibly uncomfortable and tries to shut her down. She repeatedly is asking and is getting more aggressive with it. I interject and I am like ""Hey Kathy, I think you are a bit too old and ugly for my son."" This got her upset really quickly, and she excuses herself to the bathroom and starts crying. My wife goes to comfort her, and then later she leaves. At the end of it my wife is super angry with me for saying that, that I should have said hey Cathy looks like you had too much to drink or something else. I told my wife, that Kathy (btw this is not her real name) works a corporate job she has had training on this and that she knows better. And our son was uncomfortable. He is 18+ but he doesn't know how to deal with an adult-adult let alone someone saying that in our house. I told my wife flat out that if I was to invite a guy friend and he was to ask to see our daughter in a bikini my wife would have called the police. She says its different. I tell her that I was way kinder to Kathy than I would have been had a guy said something like that to our daughter. And I told my wife that Kathy needs to apologize to my son before she can ever come into our house again. Overall, I think I was fair. If Kathy just said it once and I said that I think I would be the asshole, but the fact she kept repeating it that's why I said it. And I wanted her to get the message that yes I am upset that's why I included the ugly part."
34,Not the A-hole,AITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?,37926,avtmig,268,"This issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.I am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like ""Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19."" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.But there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.I was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.It all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.She had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's"", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.I was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.She is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.Edit: I am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. Each comment means the world to me. I am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. No one besides my family has said these things to me. I know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. From the bottom of my heart,thank you.Edit 2: Honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. I promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. Thank you for the gold.Thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. I honestly have gone through as many as I can and I just feel really fortunate and grateful.I sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. Thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.Edit 3: I am sorry for boring you with all these edits. I geniunely can't thank you guys enough. I showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. I am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.BUT, I have been noticing a worrying number of DMs saying me I could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.I am not this kind of person and I hope nobody is. I have my own integrity. It's NOT right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. A couple of other DMs sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. It's honestly horrifying. I am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. I just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. I thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. A lot of women ARE amazing. My mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and I am sure many women out there are amazing.  Please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. Because I am not going to do that, ever. Please don't say all women are manipulative etc. This post isn't anti-women in anyway, it's me talking about the person I believe wronged me."
35,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking my cousin off of my sister’s wedding Zoom call?,37265,hx80wd,1418,"My [27M] older sister [30F] and her fiancé [31M] were planning for over a year for their wedding to be this month. Obviously, they can’t have the wedding as planned, but they still would like to get married, so they decided on a “Zoom” wedding where all of the family/friends would just call in to watch the officiant, my sister, and her fiancé. My sister didn’t want to be in charge of hosting the Zoom call because she thought it would stress her out, so she asked me to and I gladly accepted. She and her fiancé decided to invite everyone they originally wanted to, and it was a very big list. When we were going over the list, my sister mentioned to me that she wanted everyone else to be muted for the majority of the wedding as she was worried that others would talk over her and her fiancé and quote “overshadow” them on their big day “that was already scaled down”. However, her and her fiancé said that I should unmute everyone at one point so everyone could talk and have a nice time with each other. Fast-forward to the day of the wedding—everyone is muted during the ceremony which goes great, and so I then unmute everyone and ask to please raise a hand if they’d like to talk so it doesn’t get confusing. My cousin (around my age) starts waving his hand crazily, and he’s with his longtime girlfriend (also similar age I guess). He’s a very gregarious guy, so I was not surprised. Then, he says stuff like “(my sister) and (her husband) are such an inspiration, it’s given me the courage to do this....” then turns to his girlfriend and pulls out a box that is the size of an engagement ring box??I immediately saw this as him trying to steal the spotlight (something that he’s done since we were kids, ex: he would secretly mess up my sister and I’s drawings if the adults would praise ours) and booted him off of the call. Then I quickly announced that my cousin had technical difficulties and would not be joining again. Everyone else accepted this and went about talking, and my sister and her husband did too. The rest of the wedding went smoothly—except for the fact that my cousin kept texting me angrily saying that he finally wanted to propose as a surprise with family all around and I ruined it. My aunt and uncle texted me the same. AITA??"
36,Not the A-hole,AITA for yelling at my parents that their polyamory fucked up my childhood?,37154,ihp8sc,2679,"EDIT: to all of you who DMed me to tell me about how fucking great polyamory is and that you're mad I gave it a bad name, you have issues if that's what you take away from this postI believe it started when I was around 6 years old. My parents often had 'friends' over in the house. I didn't know they were polyamorous ofc. One day I was outside playing, got hurt and when I ran inside caught my parents  making out with some random guy. They told me they have other adults that they love and it's a completely normal thing. Me being a child just accepted that.They gave up being secretive and their 'partners' would constantly be around, even joining on outings. I remember that on my 10th birthday they invited 3 of their partners, one of who I'd never seen before, and for the rest of the day my parents just withdrew from my party and hung out with them. I never saw them doing anything explicit again but they would kiss their partners, hug them make flirty comments, something that would be normal between parents but with many more people. Sometimes I came home from school and my parents were gone and there was some random adult in our house, some of them seemed surprised that my parents even had a child. I always hated it, but since my parents had told me this was normal, I assumed many adults probably did similar things and that it's just an adult thing all kids hate. Later they had less partners and eventually seemed to stop. Not that I'd know for sure bc I moved out with 17. I didn't think about it anymore. A year ago I started therapy (other reasons). As usual the topic of my upbringing came up and it brought back many feelings I wasn't aware of. I realised that although my parents were always good to me, I had never really felt close to any of them and still have a lot of resentment that they made me feel like I had to compete for my parent's attention with random strangers. A while ago, I visited them and they told me they are going to take part in a documentary about polyamorous families and that the producers would like to include interviews with the children, so they would love if I could agree and tell everyone that polyamory 'doesn't mess kids up'. All my resentment bubbled up and I said that I cannot agree because I would not be able to say anything positive. My parents looked shocked (I had never brought this up before) and asked why, and I unloaded all, that I always felt pushed aside, we barely had any family time without strangers intruding, it turned into an argument and I became loud and yelled that the truth is it did fuck me up and they shouldn't have had a child if their number one priority was fucking the whole world. My mother cried and my father said I should probably leave. So I left and was shaken up for the rest of the week but also felt regret because I've never made my mum cry before. Later my father sent me a message that was like 'we are sorry you feel that way, can we have a calm discussion about this soon'. Even though I tried to, it's like I can't reply, this argument brought something very emotional up in me.AITA for hurting my parents over this, especially since I have never brought it up before?"
37,Not the A-hole,"AITA For calling my co-worker ""chunky"" after she repeatedly calls me ""slim"" and makes references to my weight after I asked her multiple times not to.",37095,bpe2di,1870,"I have a female co-worker who repeatedly calls me out regarding my weight. I'm female 5'9"" 115lbs and very thin. She is very overweight. All the time she makes comments about my weight. She doesn't call me by name she calls me ""slim"" and I even heard her say one time ""go ask toothpick"" and she has said stuff like ""you need some meat on your bones"" & ""you need to eat"". I have only worked there 8 days. I have asked her very nicely to stop. Yesterday I asked her to stop calling me slim again and she basically said it's her mouth and she can say what she wants. Today when she said ""morning slim"" I replied ""morning chunky"" and she got upset and actually started crying. Everybody here at work, (only 6 of us total) is saying I'm wrong and I should apologize because being called fat is ""different"" than being called skinny because being called skinny is a ""compliment"". I said as long as she calls me slim, I will call her chunky and now I'm the bad person. AITA if I don't apologize? The owner/manager has completely ignored the situation saying it's ""a high school issue and we should figure it out"".EDIT FOR MORE INFO: We don't have HR. There's only 6 of us working here (cupcake shop). We are all regular employees. I went to the owner BEFORE I called her chunky and I asked him to talk to her because I felt she was harassing me. That's when he said we can handle it ourselves. That's why I called her chunky. I told her to stop calling me slim and I didn't like it and she continued to do it. She didn't stop doing it after I asked multiple times and I didn't know what to do besides what she was doing to me. She brought up my weight, I brought up her's."
38,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my wife and in-laws to fuck off after they told me to stop cuddling my daughter?,37090,ctwk69,2638,"I have 3 kids, 15F, 12F and 7M. My oldest has always been a cuddler, and that suits me fine because I am too. Recently my in laws were over, and we were all watching a movie together. It was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep.After the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. There was a fair bit of wine involved (I was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my FIL let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate I still cuddled with my 15yo. I don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but I was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. To my surprise, my wife and MIL both agreed with him.I have a lot of respect for my in-laws, I get along with them great and I consider them closer than my own parents. Obviously I'm quite fond of my wife as well, but I outright told them to ""fuck off and go fuck themselves"" and then left them and went to bed. I've never spoken to any of them like that before, but it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. They all want me to apologize for being so rude to them. AITA?Edit due to info request: We were not spooning, she was sitting next to me laying on my chest.Edit of my own free will: Idk if it's important info, but I didn't yell.Edit: I think I've read most everything now, thanks for all the messages of support and hate, I liked them all. Some people asked me to make an update post, I don't think I will, sorry. I've been speaking to them over the past few days and I know why they said what they said (although it's not relevant to me telling them to fuck off), but it's pretty personal and I don't feel like sharing. I wont be apologizing to any of them, especially now that I know their reasoning. I love my wife, but it hurts that she doesn't trust me."
39,Not the A-hole,AITA For Not Baking Much For My Family,36803,gcr7vr,1722,"I [16M] started dating my girlfriend 2 years ago. I also got super super into baking around that time. I bake a lot. My girlfriend loves desserts. So I've given her a ton of stuff I bake, all kinds of different stuff. I often try to bake something new and then she gets to try something new. I honestly love baking way more than eating it. My girlfriend is the opposite.Well recently she gave me a scrapbook she made. She had counted every thing I baked her apparently, and she gave me this scrapbook after I baked her, her 100th dessert. It was filled with a picture of every dessert I've baked and pictures of me baking  and her eating. She wrote a paragraph about each item I baked. Each item was dated too. She had been working on this for 2 years. She also wrote a long letter on how proud she is of my baking hobby, thanking me for the sweets, and telling me how much she loves me. It was the sweetest gift I've ever gotten and I honestly cried.I showed my mom and sister expecting them to think its cute but they were pissed. They were angry I've spent so much time baking for my girlfriend and not them. I just got into this habit and I loved making my girlfriend happy as well since she loves desserts."
40,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving significant facial scarring uncovered on a plane and being confrontational when a father asked me to cover it because it was scaring his son?,36652,f3asns,2800,"I sustained very bad injuries to my face this month. I'm in the stage of healing when the scar tissue has formed, but it's still very tender ""new skin"". I'm going to have very obvious facial scarring for the rest of my life. The injury starts about an inch above my hairline, goes down over my brow so that on part, hair will not grow. It continues down my cheek where it is deepest I'll always probably have an indentation in the fullest part of my cheek. Then it continues to my jawline. In some ways it's OK. I'm happy it's just cosmetic damage. My friends are super reassuring, telling me how badass and sick it's gonna look. They say I'm still as hot as ever, now a little more sexy and mysterious lol.But in some ways it really sucks... I know that I'm always gonna be seen first as ""the girl with the scar"" and it feels especially bad when people look at me differently.This week, I had to fly home for a family thing it was a plan I'd made long before my injury. I wasn't really looking forward to the pity or people making a big deal of it I'd rather it not be acknowledged.I'd also met with my dermatologist who said that I was at the stage of scar tissue formation that I no longer should be dressing the wounds the skin was healing and instead I needed to be applying topical cream and Vaseline to keep the site clean and moist. It also looks a bit ugly the building scar tissue is very red and tender, and with the Vaseline over it, looks slick and shiny.So I get on this flight I have the window seat and I put on my headphones and drift off to sleep when the plane is still boarding.I wake up to this kid, maybe 4 years old, sat next to me, throwing a tantrum. I didn't catch the first part of it and I honestly couldn't understand what he was yelling about... His father said to me, ""Can you cover that injury?"" I said that my dermatologist recommends I don't, so no I don't think I will. He started snapping at me saying ""there is no need to be so rude. That injury is graphic and it's scaring my little one.""I said ""this is my face. The only damn face I've got. It sucks being told I'm so ugly I can't show my goddamn face in public.""He started to backtrack saying ""just until it's healed"" and I said ""it'll always be with me. Maybe teach some fucking compassion and respect instead of telling a girl half your damn age what you think about her face. That's rude. He actually got up after that and I think went to a stewardess about a seat change because a young couple came to sit next to me on a few minutes instead. I've gotta admit I felt so low that I put on my sunglasses and had a quiet cry for a few minutes.AITA for not covering my healing scar, and for being confrontational about it?"
41,Not the A-hole,AITA for throwing my sister out of my house after she billed me?,36474,iiqfnz,1471,"My sister is a trainwreck. She needed a place to stay and I have a large enough home for an extra person. She has no job or income. I told her she has a few months to get her shit together and leave. I give her about $100 a week to keep my house clean so she has some cash.I gave my sister her $100 and she said I owed her more. I was confused. She said she did other ""work"" for me. I asked her what more did she do? She said she walks my dog in the afternoon. I walk my dog every morning and evening. But she takes him with her on her afternoon walks. She said the going rate for a dogwalker is $25 per walk. 5 X $25 = $125 on top of the $100.Then she mentions she put together a scrapbook of personal letters and papers. According to her and Etsy, that job was easily another $75. I told her I never gave her permission to do those things. Her argument is that those jobs fell under the umbrella of keeping the house clean and I was ripping her off.So I threw her out. The money isn't the issue. I have plenty of disposable income. I was disgusted how she came at me."
42,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not wanting my son to literally be named ""John Doe?""",36431,ejycvt,4085,"So my last name is Doe.

His name was John. I liked her grandfather, and I know he and my wife were very close, but I won't even consider it, not even for our son's middle name. I feel that's just setting him up a world of problems, especially when he grows up and has to apply for jobs. Nobody's going to believe ""John Doe"" is his real name. My wife thinks I'm being an asshole for vetoing a name with a strong family connection and says I'm exaggerating the issues he would face. AITA?"
43,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my wife it’s not ‘cute’ for her to encourage our teenage daughter to expect her boyfriend to pay for EVERYTHING in their relationship?,36319,gnkxa5,2235,"Wife and I have been married 18 years, we have our 16 year old daughter who has been dating a slightly shy/ awkward young man for around 3-4 months now. He seems very nervous around my daughter and has admitted in a passing comment here and there to my wife and I that he can’t believe she agreed to date him and he thinks she’s way out of his league. He seems very respectful, just shy.  My wife is usually an independent, awesome woman and her ideals align closely with mine particularly in term of feminism and equality. We have both striven to raise our daughter to be as independent and capable as possible. Since my daughter has been dating this kid my wife has changed considerably and has given our daughter advice that has left me with raised brows more than once. Some of the advice I’ve heard my wife give is ‘oh it’s cute for boys to pay for everything, especially in your first relationship!’ Or ‘oh honey don’t worry about that, he can pay for you, if he really liked you he would’ and similar. I’ve tried to balance this out by telling my daughter straight away ‘two people in a partnership should be contributing equally’ and my personal favorite ‘if someone asks if they can *take you out* to dinner, it’s reasonable to expect them to pay, but if someone asks you to grab dinner with them, it’s reasonable to split the payment’. I figured that would be an easy way for a young person to understand the difference. However I’ve noticed my daughter becoming more and more entitled with her boyfriends money. They haven’t been anywhere obviously since we’re home but the way she talks about him ‘oh I’ll just ask him to pay for x’ etc leaves a bad taste in my mouth. She has also flippantly bragged/ mentioned that she gets him to buy gift cards for her etc by mentioning her mother’s advice, i.e. ‘if you really liked me you’d pay for x’ I spoke to my wife privately and told her my concerns, she insists it’s a rite of passage for girls and it’s cute that she should feel a guy is completely spoiling her. I told her that it’s not cute for her to be thinking it’s acceptable to view relationships as personal ATMS, and my wife became very angry with me and is now calling me an asshole with a lot of hostility."
44,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to pay back my cousin after my baby ruined her blouse?,36223,cw43oc,8873,"Hi all. I gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter Charlotte. My cousin Alice and her parents were among the guests. The first thing I'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. She's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. She doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. She is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. It was Alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly Charlotte vomited on her. Alice handed Charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. I went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.Today I got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly £1800) since it was completely ruined. I have said no. At the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. She took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. I feel bad for her but it was not my fault. Am I doing the right thing by refusing to pay up?"
45,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my parents they only have one daughter and she is six feet in the ground.,36049,kvjl5f,2408,"This all started when I was 12 years old and my younger sister was ten. Let's call her Abby. Well, Abby started to get sick and no one in the family knew what was going on. I started to be dropped off at my grandparents as they went to different doctors. I'm not going to go into her illness but when the doctors figured it out it was bad. So a lot of time was devoted to my sister. When I was 14 it got worse and I started to be left at my grandparents for longer amounts of time. It started with just staying the weekend and then maybe the whole week. I would bring it up and they told me that they have to focus on Abby. Soon I was staying there for months. By the time I was 16 I was basically living there full time. I would maybe see them every other month. If it texted them about the whole thing the same response was always sent, We need to focus on Abby right now.I'm 19 now and Abby has passed away from her illness. Her funeral was two weeks ago and I attended through facetime. I got a call today from my parents and they wanted to met up and be a family again. I told them that they abandoned one child for another. I am not their child anymore. That they only have one daughter and she is six feet under the ground now. I soon hung upI've been getting texts calling me an ass and that I should understand that they needed to focus on ABBy and to suck it up basically. So AITA"
46,Not the A-hole,AITA for admitting I regret having children.,36004,e7t57k,5227,"My wife and I are both 42 and in marriage counselling after our marriage basically went to shit after having kids (6 and 4 year old twins). A lot of issues and disagreements have come up in our marriage that have driven us apart and I have been working through my resentment that going back for one more baby resulted in twins, including one which we are pretty sure has ADHD and ODD and is a *nightmare* child). Our counsellor asked me if I would have children if I had to do it all over again and I said ""honestly, no"". I love my kids and would take a bullet for them, but if I had the chance to go back to 24 when I finished grad school and could do my life over again, I wouldn't choose fatherhood. It is not the fulfilling experience everyone claims and while I love my children, the sacrifices are not worth it to me. I had a much happier life before having children and have gone from someone who loved life to someone who just.....makes it through the day, working a job he hates to provide for the wife and kids while silently wishing this wasn't my life. My wife is *furious* and taking it the wrong way and even told our 6 year old ""daddy wishes you were never born"" which makes me livid. You don't tell the kid that.Yes, I wish I never had kids, but I do love them, would never hurt them or want to upset them. And I didn't say it to/in front of my kids and I never ever will. I said it in marriage counselling, what should be a safe space to talk about feelings. It has become a huge fight, our marriage is not going to be saved now, and I know she will try and use this against my in divorce court to try and get sole custody and take everything and lie to the kids who I do love and still want to be a Dad to them. She is incapable of understanding that you can love your kids but also feel that parenthood was the best choice for you.  AITA for saying it though?Edit: Ok this blew the fuck up and there is no way I can reply to everyone's questions. But to address a couple I have 3 kids not 4. One child is 6, two are four. English is not my first language and I forgot the comma, and even so that sentence would have been much clearer in my native language. When I say I resent having twins, I am not saying it is my wife's fault! But 3 children is more than we budgeted/bargained for and I need to pick up a lot overtime I that I would not have had to pick up if we just had 2 kids, and that is what I resent (that and the child with ADHD/ODD). My life is basically work and dealing with my kids. And do you know what ODD is? This child always refuses to do what is asked, gets angry and throws a tantrum when asked to do something he doesn't want to do, hits and kicks others, deliberately annoys and hurts others, is extremely spiteful, screams and kicks me constantly. ALWAYS. All day. Every day. It's exhausting and it is hell. Yeah. I would't have him again. Most people wouldn't if they had to raise him.  Just because I wouldn't do this over again doesn't mean I'm not committed to being a good dad and being present in their lives. I just would not do it over again if I could redo my adult life. My first kid was not born at 24, I just said that because if I could do my whole post-University life differently, I would change some other things too (mainly career) and to be honest, after all this, I regret marrying my wife, which is why I said it that way.Regarding calling the ADHD/ODD twin a nightmare, go google what that means. It is very difficult to manage and he has even been kicked out of three daycare places because they could not handle him and my parents even refuse to babysit him. We never get a break from home and no one can handle time."
47,Not the A-hole,AITA for suggesting/letting my 17 year old son get drunk?,35570,e9bilu,4766,"I (46M) live with my wife and my 17 year old son. My wife has been on a different continent for about a month taking care of her dying mother, so it has just been me and my son for that time.My son and I have a very close relationship where he tells me almost everything going on in his life. On Saturday, he told me that he was going to his first ever high school party this upcoming weekend. He was a bit nervous since he had never really drank before, but he knew that he was going to on that occasion. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but this is in Canada where the drinking age is 19 (in my province), and teenage drinking is very common.I asked my son if he wanted to have a few beers with me while we watched a sports game that night, as a ""test run"" of sorts. My logic was that if he goes into the party with zero awareness of his tolerance then it could end badly, and it would be best for him to find out his limit in the safety of his home with me.We had some beers over a few hours in the night, and I cut him off at 6 (he has had beer in the past, but never more than one at a time). He was pretty drunk but he was okay, and slept it off. We talked about it the next day, and we agreed that six was a bit much for him, and now he knows to have fewer than that at the party.I was actually pretty content with this whole situation, since he had his ""first experience"" drinking in a safe environment, and I feel much more comfortable with him going to a party now. However, in an effort to be transparent I told my wife about it the other day over the phone, and she was livid. She thinks it was reckless and irresponsible.AITA?INFO: I understandably am getting flack for not telling my wife beforehand, but I figured she had enough going on and I didn't need to bother her with something that seemed pretty trivial at the timeEDIT: Thanks for all the comments, I am reading every single one! I appreciate the different perspectives"
48,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling this college guy's mom that her coming into his interview cost him the job?,35469,hukoub,1820,"I am a hiring manager at a tech company and I was hiring for summer internships a little while ago.We had a guy, about 19 years old, applying for a summer internship between his freshman and sophomore years of college. It was a virtual interview over Zoom because of covid. A minute or two in, when I was introducing myself, his mom came in and introduced herself and started talking about her son's work ethic. I thought it was a little strange. I said something polite about wanting to hear from him.She just didn't get the hint and kept coming into camera frame during the interview and interrupting her son to answer questions for him. I asked a few technical questions which he seemed to answer well and then cut the interview fairly short.I thought that was all over and done with until I'd gotten an email from a woman, a month later, asking about her son's application, she seemed offended he hadn't gotten an acceptance or rejection. It bothered me, I felt bad for the kid honestly. Wayyy back when I was a teenager, my mom used to pull the same shit, but luckily she only did that when I was 15 and working for a day-camp, not when I was an adult applying for engineering jobs. But I felt like this poor kid was getting his chances ruined because his mom wasn't giving him the chance to apply on his own.I sent an email back saying I was not at liberty to send information about an application to anybody but the applicant. I also asked HR to send an email to the kid saying sorry but we were not making him an offer. (It is something we usually do, but his rejection email must have slipped through the cracks with all the Covid craziness.)Anyway, after we sent that, I got a phone call from his mom, she had a forwarded copy of the email, and she was demanding answers.I said that I could not comment on the guy's performance in the interview to her as she was not the applicant. If he wanted to reach out to me I was happy to give him some feedback. However, I could say that regardless of his performance, her presence in the interview took him out of consideration for the position. We were looking for an independent and self-driven person for the position, and for that reason, it is important to see an applicant speak for themselves, follow-up themselves, etc.I also said that, as a piece of advice, every hiring manager I've met in my career who sees someone other than the applicant answering questions during an interview, following up on the applicant's behalf, etc... Would also put their resume in the ""do not hire"" pile. Since, while the applicant may be skilled and motivated, they need the ability to demonstrate those traits themselves. She fucking blew up at me over that, kinda cussing me out to the point where I hung up.AITA for how I handled this? Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut way earlier"
49,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my husband to turn down his dream job for my career?,35317,ii4zpu,5901,"I’m going to be vague for privacy reasons, sorry.  I (33F) am the breadwinner of our household. I have multiple, highly specialized degrees for a niche industry. I make 200k+, with potential to get in the 600-M’s range. My company has not been hit that badly by COVID, so most of us have kept our jobs, but we’re held to strict standards.  My husband (36M) has a broad degree/work experience. He quit his job right before COVID hit, hoping for a better job in the meantime, and I was supportive. He spent a ton of time applying to various jobs, and finally landed an interview at Organization X. This is his dream job, in almost every imaginable way (I can’t be detailed). However, it’s paying about 65k a year, which would be fine except this job directly puts my job stability at risk. My company and this org. are adversarial, at best. My field is extremely secretive, and if clients discovered my spouse was working for a competitor, I would be permanently tainted. I wouldn’t be able to get a job in the industry forever. I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I promise you, it absolutely is not.It’d be like if I worked in protecting the privacy of celebrities, and he worked for TMZ. If he tapped my car, got into my work devices, he could use that to advance his career, and any trust I have in this field will be gone. Even if I trusted my husband not to do that, my clients and company don’t. Worse, b/c my background is so specialized, this is the only field I can work in. I asked him to drop from consideration for this job, since if he got it, we’d lose my income. 65k a year cannot support us in this city. Plus, he does not have to work for this organization. Even if the job market is awful right now, his background gives him access to a wide range of jobs, but I only have this one, niche field. He was extremely angry, and said I was “selfish and only cared about money.” I told him that if he wanted to go back to school for an advanced degree or just be unemployed for a while, I would support him, but taking this job isn’t possible. He continued the process behind my back, and got the offer. He wants to accept it, b/c he says his career needs to take priority and that I wasn’t being a supportive wife. I feel so betrayed, and I’ve contacted all relevant higher ups in my company to inform them. I notified them as soon as he got the interview, b/c it’s better coming from my email than from a background check. I told him he could decline the offer, w/me watching him physically decline it, or he could accept the offer and move out immediately. I would pay for him to stay two weeks at a hotel, and we would begin divorce proceedings. My company is willing to take care of all of my legal fees. I feel fucking awful. I still love him. I moved decisively, b/c this was the best way to cut my losses, but it still hurts. He called me heartless and cold. It’s true that I was prioritizing my career over his, but it felt like the only option at the time."

Let's move on.""​This continued for a few months. Despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when I wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name Jack. I finally told him ""You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""​His response was ""Sure thing, Jackie boy.""​Since I don't work directly with him, I figured ""screw it"" and that I'd ignore him.​Recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental.

See you there for a lift back to the office!""​(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)​As promised, I ignored him.​7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and I get a call. I recognize his number, so I ignored it. He called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.The first one was along the lines of ""Jack I'm at Enterprise. Come pick me up.""E-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as Jack, Jack-o, Jackie, and Jackie-boy. The emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.​I signed out and went home. It was raining hard.Next morning, I saw that Ted had sent a few more e-mails. I printed them off. At 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""Where the [f-bomb] were you? I told you when to pick me up! I HAD TO TAKE A CAB! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST ME?!"" He goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.​Supervisor: ""Ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. He was caught out in the rain.""​I relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. I'd highlighted the threats.Supervisor: ""I can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. But it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. That's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""With the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. Just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.""​A few people at the office have commented that I'm the jerk for ignoring Ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired.​*AM* I the a-hole on this?"
52,Not the A-hole,AITA for ruining game night by telling the truth?,34568,i34mdp,1841,"A few nights ago, I hosted a game night for a small group of friends (we had all been quarantining and following the proper guidelines in my county). It was only going to be 5 of us (including me), but one of my friends texted me last minute that she was going to bring a coworker from work (Matt-fake name). Fine with me.We started playing a card game where you answer questions about yourself based on the level (Level 1, 2, 3), the question could be extremely surface level (ex. what's your favorite color?) to something deeper (ex. what characteristic of yourself do you not like about yourself?). Everyone was enjoying themselves, and I was happy with the way things were going.Cue a question I drew: ""What's the hardest thing you've ever had to go through?""Some backstory: My sister passed away a few years ago when I was still in high school. I was pulled out of class and flew immediately to her college and watched her die in the ICU. Needless to say, this is probably the hardest thing I've been through. 3 of my friends in the group knew about this, the other 2 and Matt did not.I didn't want to bring the mood down, so I answered that the hardest thing I'd been through was transitioning going to a college in a different state where I knew no one. We were all ready to move on, but Matt immediately piped up and said, ""Wow, if that's the hardest thing you've ever been through, you live an extremely privileged life."" Everyone got quiet. Now, if he had said it jokingly, I probably would have let it go and moved on. However, the way he said it was in a very condescending and patronizing tone, and I will admit, it rubbed me the wrong way. Instead of letting it go, I said ""well, the hardest thing I've ever been through is seeing my sister die in the ICU and having to watch her being lowered into her grave when I was 17. I just didn't want to bring the mood down.""If things were quiet before, they were dead silent now. Matt mumbled an apology but game night ended shortly after. After my friends all left, my friend who had brought Matt texted me and told me I was a jerk for making Matt look bad, and I could have just let his statement go. I do feel bad about what I said and being the cause of game night ending so soon, but I also feel like I was just making a justified statement. AITA?"
53,Not the A-hole,AITA for going to the police over a 'prank',34159,devz7y,6034,"Throwaway for anonymity sake incase this does go further. To preface this, I (24F) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. I have not eaten meat since I was roughly 3-4 years old when I found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). This is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so I thought. Four nights ago, I was at a party and I will admit, I got white girl wasted. My friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. I checked with them before chowing down ""are these vegan?"" To which my friends replied ""yeah, they're sunfed"" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). They tasted off to me but I figured it was just because I was drunk. I was wrong. I found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends Snapchat story. The story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where I asked if it was vegan). The and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when I found out I ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling ""the CHICKENS!!!""). I took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges. They all think that I'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so Reddit, AITA? In my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. In their view, it was just a prank."
54,Not the A-hole,AITA for blowing up at my stepsister at her comments about my lost weight?,34054,efz1kb,1930,"My stepsister (20F) and I (24M) have never gotten along. Her mom and my dad got married when we were six and ten so we've known each other for a long time. In my stepmom's eyes, she could do no wrong and anything bad that happened was pinned on me. My dad is a complete pushover so he would always fall over to whatever my stepmom would say.When I was about 15, I started gaining weight. My gf broke up with me (woohoo high school romance), I started failing some of my classes, and I quit baseball. I started to stress-eat and ballooned up from 125 pounds to 162. I guess at that point she decided she was ""cooler"" than I was and started mocking me and making fun of me, calling me names like ""fatass"" and ""chubster"". I would constantly go to my stepmom about it and she would tell me she's just teasing, she's so much younger, why are you getting upset? I got pissed off to the point where I just started avoiding her and locking myself upstairs in my room with a bag of chips. At 22 I hit 270 pounds and I knew I had gone too far. I was way past my weight limit and bordering on obese. So as a New Year's resolution, I decided to start losing weight. I cut out all junk food and started hitting the gym. Around this time my stepsister started to overeat too, I don't really know why but she gained over 30 pounds. She still was constantly belittling me about my weight (which admittedly, was way over hers).By the end of this year, I lost 120 lbs. It felt amazing. My stepsister now weighed more than me. Over Christmas dinner, all the aunts and uncles and cousins were complimenting me on my weight loss, telling me how I looked so much better. My stepsister just sat there smoldering. Every time someone said something she'd add, ""He's still pretty big"", ""Well he didn't get rid of that face roundness"", ""Maybe lose a little more around that gut"". It was infuriating and I was getting angrier.Now here's where I might be TA. Finally, at her last little snide, ""Look, you know you'll just put it all back on. Why do you even bother?"" I flipped out. I yelled, ""Why can't you just be happy for me, instead of getting on me for every little thing?""She said back to me, ""Defensive much?""  ""Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your 200-pound feelings?"" I asked her. I probably should have stopped there but I kept going. ""Calling me a fatass. Look at your plate! You've eaten half the table, fatty!"" She started crying and left the table. My stepmom screamed at me, saying just because I was insecure I can't take it out on everyone. I said, ""Oh, so *now* you're talking. Not in the past ten years of constant 'fatty' and 'lardass' and 'porker'!""  ""But you're way older!"" she whined.I left the table too and went home. I woke up today to a thousand messages from my stepmom, my dad, and my stepsister. They were saying I wasn't welcome to their house until I apologized. I'm not going to.AITA?EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for your comments and the awards. I've never felt better about myself than now. And yes, I understand that 270 lbs was not ""bordering"" on obese. I'm 6'0 so I was pretty damn obese. I called myself bordering for a few years after getting fat, it made me feel better than classifying myself as morbidly obese."
55,Not the A-hole,AITA for I telling my childhood bully (who is MtF transgender) that she will always be the “boy who bullied me”?,33971,dcb1vq,2756,"When I was a in middle school, I was viciously bullied by this boy, who I’ll call Z. He spread rumours about me, called me stupid and useless every chance he got, and made school a living hell. It’s been 12 years, and Z has since come out as MtF transgender. She messaged me over social media and asked to meet up. We went out for coffee, where she apologised for bullying me. It was along the lines of, “I’m sorry for being mean. I was young, and I was struggling with my gender identity.”I thanked her for her apology. When she asked if she was forgiven, and I tried to avoid answering. I am still not over what she did to me. What Z did to me impacted me greatly, as I was a impressionable young girl. I struggled with self esteem for years afterwards. Z started getting defensive. She told me that I was being petty and that I should forgive her. I told her, “Why? You will always be the boy that bullied me.  An apology won’t change that.” She got really offended when I said the word boy, and said that I was misgendering her. She called me a petty, transphobic, vindictive, and ignorant, then stormed out. AITA?"
56,Not the A-hole,AITA for outing my ex as gay after she told everyone that I cheated on her?,33897,dwrlls,4125,"I know the title sounds absolutely terrible.  My ex and I were together for 5 years. I decided to propose, but she rejected me. The next day, we had a talk. She realized that she was gay, since ""I've been trying to hard to please myself from men"". We broke up. The very next day, I get bombarded with text messages. My friends asked if this was true, and they linked me to a post. It was a Facebook (who uses Facebook) post (exposing me) about me cheating. She said that's why we broke up. Now I usually am not evil, but this pissed me off. She was destroying my reputation, for god knows why. I simply commented that the real reason that we broke up was because she is gay. People didn't believe me, until my ex literally screamed at me for outing her. Then a lot of people started to call her out for her lies. I know I'm probably a huge asshole. Though I feel like she deserves it. But alas, AITA? No. I did not cheat on her. Yes. I did have sex with someone the day that we broke up. But it was after."
57,Not the A-hole,AITA for reporting my car stolen when my sister took it after I told her not to?,33849,bp8v29,4413,"My sisters car broke down 6 months ago because of her own stupidity. I won't go into it here but she ignored the advice of a mechanic and because of that her car broke. I decided to be nice and offer my sister my car until she could get hers fixed as i could bike to work while she needed to drive. She did not get her car fixed for some reason. She claimed to be saving money to do so but every time her paycheck came she spent it. My parents have even offered her a loan to fix her car but she refused. Along with all of this, she has been abusing my generosity and taking my car all day and night. I told her she could use it for work but is seems to her that is a free pass to use my car, not fill it with gas, and take it when I specifically tell her not to.Recently I've been needed to get to work very early and I really don't feel like riding my bike 6 miles at 3 in the morning so I told my sister she had 30 days until I took the spare key from her and she is no longer allowed to use it. That was 32 days ago. Yesterday morning she woke up specifically before me to take my car (at 2:30 in the morning). I called her and demanded she bring it back but she just hung up on me. because of this I reported it stolen.My sister was arrested 30 minutes later and my parents had to go bail her out. My sister is now facing charges for unauthorized use of a car and my parents and her are pissed. They claim I want way to far here but honestly, i feel justified. My parents are worried if she's found guilty she will loose her job but in my opinion, it's her own fault. Am i wrong here? Am i an asshole?"
58,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling my husband that his culture is garbage and I won't ""compromise"" by incorporating it into our family life?",33703,i79ikq,3097,"My husband and I live in the US northeast, where I am from. “John” moved here for work several years ago, from the deep south of the US where he grew up, raised with Christian holidays but never attending church. Coincidentally, shortly before everything hit, John’s parents AND his childhood best friend “Dan” and his wife decided to move here as well.This past weekend was the first that us three couples have gathered together since any of us moved here we had a “distanced picnic” at our house. John sat down 2-3 minutes after I did, as he was settling our kid into his pen in the yard with us. Dan and my FIL immediately started to “jokingly” rip on him for being “whipped” and doing “my” job of parenting our child while he was supposed to be “allowed” to just catch up with the two other men. I was trying to politely deflect when it turned to how “mean” I was for not “fixing him a plate” and serving him  before serving myself. (If I thought a certain dish would run out before he got to it, or if he had asked me to, I of course would have!) Dan and FIL continued to brag about how their families ""do it right"", where they handle the “outside chores” while their wives handle the “inside chores” (including the care of Dan and his wife’s two children). I think it’s important to note here that both currently live in rented condos that by their nature do not have “outdoor chores”, and **both their wives have always worked full time, as I do**.The whole day was kind of wrecked by that start, and I was frustrated when John left with Dan and FIL to “go for a walk” and left me to do all the clean up alone while also looking after our kid. I expected John to apologize when he returned hours later, but instead HE got at ME for “making \[him\] look bad” in front of his friend and dad. He brought up how “a traditional division of labor” is “a huge part of southern culture”, and how I was being “disrespectful” to his background by “forcing northern culture” onto him and his family. He said he’s been building up a lot of “resentment” the past few months that I “make” him do half the chores and childcare, since in his “culture”, women do the chores and hands-on childcare, and men do the fun parenting, the discipline, mow the grass, and bring in the cars for oil changes when needed.I was stunned but honest and told him southern culture is garbage. It's bigotry. I lived in John's home state for 8 years, and I saw how ""southern hospitality"" is reserved only for those in your in-group. Deviate from the norm--be queer, non-Christian, a POC, a liberal, a non-traditional woman--and they turn on you viciously. Does every single person act like that always? No. But it's the culture. John is livid and says his ""culture"" is just as valid as that of other global regions, religions, and ethnic groups, so I am the bigot by not ""compromising"" with him here and incorporating aspects of his culture into our family life the way I would if his ""culture"" was ""Islamic or Asian or whatnot""."

She had a mommy blog all when I was growing up and of course me and my sister were always involved. It sucks because there's so much our there about us and it's what's gonna come up when I'm looking for a job, when I'm dating, when anyone looks up my name.I found a website that will print custom jackets, print all over the front and back and arms... And I ordered some hoodies that say a bunch of phrases all over them.""No photos"" ""no videos"" ""i do not consent to be photographed"" ""no means no"" ""respect my privacy"" ""no cameras"" ""no profiting off my image""It sounds silly but it looks pretty sick actually. I got one for me and one for my nine year old sister who's started to not always want photos.And I guess the idea is that my mom can't take good looking pictures, even candid ones, with us in the hoodies without them having a pretty strong message that we don't want to be in pictures.My mom was mad when they showed up, and really mad when I'm wearing mine. Like she says she just wants pictures to remember my young years by, she won't post ones without askingBut I know that's a whole mess anyway she always says that and then negotiates me into letting her post, like either by saying that's how she makes income so if I want money for something, to stop arguing about pictures. Or posting without asking and then saying I thought it would be ok because you're face wasn't visible / you're just in the background, etc.And I'm always like ""no you didn't THINK. if you thought at all you'd remember what I said I want. No new pictures of me or mentions of me online. Remove all pictures that include me that you've ever posted. and delete any writing that mentions me. I am just so fed up, and upset that my mom is mad at me for wearing my new hoodie everyday. She's mad I won't take it off for any event and thinks it's inappropriate to wear to certian things.I know it's really weird looking but it feels like my only option.Edit to add a couple more things... She also says all the mentions of consent and ""no means no"" and ""this body is my own"" (sorry forgot to mention that one earlier) imply something more inappropriate and that it is really inappropriate to wear those words out in public. We've also fought about me wearing it to family events and school events with a generally dressier dress code, because it looks like a ""gangster hoody"". I don't know what to say to that, but I don't agreeAITA for always wearing my no photos hoodie?"
60,Not the A-hole,AITA for wanting my daughter’s boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance to know her dark secret before marriage?,33521,briguv,4975,"I’m the dad of a 25 year old young woman who I love very much. I’ve been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and I enjoy my time with her, but there’s one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.She exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, I realized she needed professional help. Throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. With an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. She received an ASPD diagnosis at 18, and I had suspected it for long prior.After her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. She’s law-abiding has a decent job and a good education and has many good friendships and admirers. Especially male admirers she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. She uses that old dating guide “The Rules” like a Bible. She currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who’s crazy about her, and who I have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). He is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.But I doubt she loves him. We’ve had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she’s been open with me that she doesn’t feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. When she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt “pretty neutral” about the whole thing. She has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she’s ever done, and doesn’t know what guilt feels like. While she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, I highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.Her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she’s been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it’ll scare him away. I’ve made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry that he has the right to know and consider it **or I will** to which she always responds, “I know you wouldn’t dare.” I actually would - I really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this “secret” from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.I’m not trying to sabotage my daughter’s future. **Maybe** her boyfriend’s love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won’t end the relationship. It’s his decision to make but he deserves all the facts. Someday he’s bound to find out she’s a bit “off” it can’t be kept a secret forever. AITA?"
61,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting upset that my sister’s fiancé pulled me aside and patted me down at their wedding?,33399,cmvrbe,3039,"The title sounds so stupid but here we go anyways.I’m 24 and I’m an addict who has been in recovery for the past six months. I used and used until I was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than once. She’s my best friend and I know it hurt her a lot to see me like that. She also met her fiancé two years ago and he really only knew me as the junkie brother then. He’s not my biggest fan to say the least considering how much I put my sister through. Despite this she still invited me to her wedding last week because I am her brother and she wanted me to be there. When I get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in. When I walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure I “didn’t bring anything in”.  I instinctively pull away, because why wouldn’t I, and I tell him not to touch me. He tells me to “calm down” and that if I want to be here then he needs to do this. I tell him he’s being ridiculous and I try to push past him. He stops me and tells me that he doesn’t want to throw me out but he “will if he has to.” I told him that he’s trying to look tough but it’s just making him look stupid. At this point I’m getting more and more angry and I’m practically yelling in his face at this point. Bystanders came between us and separated us and told my BIL to just “drop it.” He said he would but that “they can deal with it when I get out of hand.”I just went to go find a seat after that. After the reception, a lot of my family told me that I should’ve let him just do it and that I was acting like a huge asshole and like I had “something to hide.” I don’t think he had any right to pat me down, especially in front of people and I don’t think my reaction was over the top. If anything, he was the one acting like a huge douche by trying to start drama so he can look tough. My sister has refused to take any sides in this. AITA?"

My son told us that he took the TV to the dump as it was shattered and useless. My daughter and son-in-law (my 4yo granddaughters parents) felt very bad for what had happened and paid the cost of the TV that day.My husband was watching our security cameras and our son's story doesn't hold up. We never see our granddaughter breaking the TV. All that we see is our son taking away the TV that is not shattered. We asked our son about this and he said that the security camera must have cut out the part that shows our granddaughter breaking the TV.Eventually I got a call from my son's girlfriend that lives with him. She said that she knew what was going on and felt guilty. She basically told us that our son had made up the story about the TV breaking and stole it and took it to their house to watch. I filed a police report and his girlfriend let the police into their house to get us our TV back. We do plan on pressing charges against him. He stole our TV and made my daughter pay for it. That is messed up on so many levels. AITA for pressing charges?"
63,Not the A-hole,AITA for saying my sister needs to stop bringing up her miscarriage for attention?,32957,eejyso,2225,"Okay this is a doozy, so please strap in and bear with me. For context here, my sister is 30, I am 22. Ten years ago, my sister had a miscarriage. Obviously, it was devastating for her and the whole family and it took her a couple of years to fully heal from it. We're still not 100% sure why it happened, but it was a one off and she's since had three very healthy, beautiful children, including a set of twins. So here's the thing. My sister and I don't really get on. She resented me as a kid because she had to share mum's attention and because she thought mum left her dad to be with mine. Never really grew out of that resentment and she was pretty much my biggest bully throughout childhood and my teenage years. One thing she absolutely cannot stand is when  mum and I do things without her, or when mum pays more attention to me than to her. When this happens she calls mum and says she's feeling really upset about the miscarriage and without fail mum goes running. This includes a trip to Paris I took mum on for her birthday earlier this year, which she cut short because sister said she needed her. Also includes when I had a manic episode so bad I was hospitalised and sister managed to need mum every time she was planning to visit me and so she never did. Note, these times when mum is spending more time with me than her are the only times sister brings up what happened and certainly the only times she still gets so upset about it. So recently I was sick. Like, don't leave the bathroom for days, can only keep water down sick. Didn't manage to get the doctor, but I think it was norovirus. It lasted about a week Mum was popping in daily on her way home from work to check on me and stuff. On the last day of being seriously unwell, when I felt I could eat again, Mum offered to make me some soup while she was there, which I accepted. She was halfway through making it when sister called her saying she was upset about the miscarriage and she told me I'd have to finish it myself because she had to go. I didn't say anything to Mum and I finished making the soup, but I sent my sister a text saying she really needs to stop bringing it up for attention because she can't bear me getting some instead. I guess she told mum and her dad because I'm hearing from all sides what a horrible, insensitive, selfish bastard I am and how dare I say that to her. I understand she may still be traumatised, I just think it's really weird how that trauma solely manifests whenever I'm getting attention and she isn't. AITA?"

Aysha is Muslim and wears a hijab to school which often causes people to give her dirty looks, comments, etc. I don’t know why. It’s just cloth. Anyway the worst instance possible was with this girl named Megan (also 15f). When we were sitting together at lunch she came up to Aysha and I and told Aysha she dared her to take her hijab off, taunting her saying she would look so pretty without it. (This was with malicious intent because I told her one time thinking she was just clueless and wanted to educate her)Then she forcibly tried to remove her hijab. I moved her hand away and we went to the principal. Instead of getting a punishment, Megan made up a sob story about how it would harm her position on some prestigious soccer club she was in. Fast forward to a few days ago. She makes a TikTok that said “when you get called to the principals office for telling the Muslim girl to take off her durag”. I was so livid for her. Aysha is very shy and didn’t want to seem like a buzzkill, so she asked me personally to email the soccer organization. Well, I did, and she was immediately kicked off and other organizations in the area were notified of her behavior. Now, all of her friends are in my dms saying how horrible I am, how I’m a retard, how I need to take a joke, etc. my parents think I should have stayed out of it. But I think I did the right thing."

I got up to go to the bathroom, and when I came back, I noticed my taco looked tampered with. I go to inspect, and lo and behold, there’s fucking cheese buried underneath the other ingredients.I told my boyfriend he was a raging douchecanoe and went to bed, leaving him to do the cleanup.

Who else would I give it to?One important note - There are 2 homes in the neighborhood that are owned by lower middle class people (me and a neighbor who's been here as long as I have). Otherwise, our neighbors are engineers and software developers. The Bay Area is simply un-affordable if you're not in tech. My daughter is a hair stylist.My fiance Steven and I have been together for 2 years. He has 2 young children (elementary school) he has joint custody of who I adore and I'm excited to help raise them. Steven and I don't have a ton in the bank so a pre-nup seemed silly if it weren't for the house. I told him that I'm ready to combine finances and plan long term with him, but I wanted a pre-nup agreement just for the house. It's a non-negotiable for me that my daughter inherits the house. He wasn't happy with this. He said that $1M split 3 ways is enough for all 3 kids to get a headstart in life. I disagree, I paid 80% of the mortgage by myself and Camila is my only child. She can have her dream life (working as a hair stylist, living in the Bay Area) with this house but will be unhappy (have to move out to a less desirable area) if it's split. I spoke to Camila about this and she agrees that she should get the house and said she always planned on inheriting it, just like I always planned on giving it to her."
67,Not the A-hole,AITA for taking back my nephews Christmas present and giving it to my son.,32564,jupcwq,2774,"My sister and I have always had a strained relationship. I usually just let things go and try to keep the piece. We both have sons who are around the same age. My nephew is 13 and my son just turned 11. For my sons birthday I bought him the new gaming system he has been wanting. He was absolutely thrilled and he plays nonstop. My sister is bad with money. I usually have to lend her money for bills and stuff for my nephew. I know my nephew doesn’t always get the best Christmas gifts so this year I went a little crazy and I purchased the same gaming system for him for Christmas. I already had it ready and wrapped under my tree.Yesterday my sisters family came to visit. My son asked me if they could go play video games. I said yes and reminded them to be careful. About 30 minutes later my son comes running to me crying. I asked him what was wrong and he led me to the front hall. When we get to the stairs I see the new system smashed on the floor. Someone had thrown it from the upstairs and it was now smashed to pieces.I asked my son what happened and he sobbed and pointed at his cousin. I asked my nephew if he did this and he started to laugh. He said that it was a “stupid baby toy” and that he saw people break them online. My sister came in and I told her what happened. I explained that this was an expensive system and that her son needs to be disaplined for what he did. I told her I wanted her to pay for what her son broke.She laughed and said no. She says I shouldn’t have let them play unsupervised. That it was my fault and that I am a bad parent. She said my son will get over it and that it was not important. Seeing my son sitting on the ground next to his broken system trying to put the pieces back together tore my heart out. I walked over to the Christmas tree and grabbed the system that was meant for my nephew. I pulled the gift wrap off and it gave it to son and told him to go upstairs and set it up.My sister asked me why I was making such a big deal when I had another one already. I than laughed and told her that was her sons Christmas gift. That since it wasn’t important and it was just a stupid baby toy than they obviously won’t miss it. I than told them to leave.My nephew realized what happened and began to cry that my son had stole his system. I said no his was the one that he smashed. My sister was livid and told me that I will never see them again. I just said okay and slammed the door.Other family members have now been calling me nonstop and saying I am an asshole and that I ruined my nephews Christmas. I don’t think so though. My nephew is 13. He is not a stupid kid and he knew what he was doing. I don’t care that it was over jealousy, he is old enough to know better. My sister was not going to make the situation right so I just did what I had to do.They all think I should buy another new system for him but I don’t have that kind of money. I’m starting to feel bad about this and I am wondering AITA?"
68,Not the A-hole,AITA for blowing up at my friend who constantly makes comments about my boobs?,32365,giww2y,2477,"I have big boobs. I’m currently at 52kg and there’s nothing I can do to change the size of these things unless I have surgery. I’m also extremely shy and from a very conservative family so my resentment and shame towards my bust is an ongoing issue. My friend *Sarah is one of those unfiltered free thinkers who says whatever is on her mind. She’s also slim and her chest is very much in proportion to the rest of her body. We work together and I’m always secretly jealous of how great shirts and tops look on her whereas I feel I look very sloppy and unprofessional with oversized, ill fitting clothes. Sarah has this way of always bringing up my boobs in conversation, starting off complimentary but often ending with an subtle insult. She knows they’re a physical feature I’m uncomfortable with but doesn’t let up. Examples of things she’ll say is how my boobs look good now but give it a few years, and they’ll be down to my knees, hahaha! Or she’ll show me comments on reddit where people are discussing chest size preferences and most are commenting how they much prefer a smaller bust over large. Or just a general reminder of how work or men will never take me seriously because of my ‘cartoon boobs’. I know she’s trying to have lighthearted fun but it gets to me and I’ve told her a few times to drop it before. Now we’re working from home, we all have daily video calls and meetings. Uniform is not necessary and can wear what we like. A few days ago, it was extremely hot and I was wearing a lighter, more revealing top than my usual baggy coverups. During this video call, in front of 6 other colleagues, Sarah starts vocalising her thoughts on my appearance: *‘Holy shit! Put those away! You look like you’re in a porno. We don’t need to see that first thing in the morning, hahaha.’* I was mortified. One other colleague laughed along but the rest looked uncomfortable. I felt close to tears, made an excuse and left the meeting. Sarah called me up half an hour later asking me what was wrong and I went off on her. Told her to go fuck herself and was sick of her constant jabs about my appearance. I went on a 10 minute tirade and hung up. Sarah has been off sick since that day and we haven’t spoken again. I’m wondering if I was too harsh and maybe should call and apologise for my outburst? Was I TA?**Edit:** I’m fuming. I just spoke with a colleague, *John, (who was part of the video call that day) and he told me that Sarah’s been telling everyone that it’s ME that’s been bullying her and making her feel insecure about her appearance. When she made those comments during the meeting, it was in retaliation to how I’ve made her feel. Apparently, I said she looks like a boy and called her flat chested and ugly several times in the past. I have NEVER and would never say this! I don’t even understand the stupid ‘boy body’ insult because a small bust has always looked very beautiful and classy in my eyes. Anyway, John knows she’s full of shit and has suggested we speak with HR. The others will also back me up. I know most people here suggested I do this and I wasn’t sure at first but fuck it, I’m reporting her. I don’t know why I ever considered her a friend, she’s fucking mental and annoying.**Edit 2:** I now feel stupid for even asking the question AITA. I thought I may have been at one point because the video call was amongst mostly work mates rather than clients and I wasn’t sure if my sensitivity towards my body image made me overreact to a joke that could have been innocent (I now realise it wasn’t).I’ve also spoken to another coworker who is closer to Sarah and she thinks Sarah may have  already reported me to HR. She said the phone conversation we had after the meeting was filled with abusive bullying language and physical threats. It wasn’t a pleasant phone call but the worst thing I said was she go fuck herself and that I don’t want to speak to her again. The rest of the conversation was just rehashing all the comments she made about my body and how it made me feel. She also claimed that I have been making inappropriate jokes about her appearance and work ethic(?) through the years and this confrontation was a long time coming. She also suggested that I’ve convinced the guys in the office to take my side by being a flirt and a tease (did I mention that I’m stupidly shy?)My head is swimming and I think I may be dealing with an actual psycho. I don’t know how it’s come to this ridiculous level of craziness. All I wanted to do was get on with my fucking work in peace and get through this crappy time but now I have to deal with this bullshit.**Update:** Just to answer a few questions I’ve seen:- I’ve contacted HR with my complaint. I have a lot of old text messages and emails with comments and memes Sarah has sent making fun of my chest size. John and other colleagues are fully supporting me as well as my manager. It will take a while for them to get back to me but I’m confident that things will be sorted and Sarah will be dealt with.- My breasts alone aren’t 52kg (114lbs). My overall weight is 52kg. I mentioned this because my chest seems much larger on my small frame making clothes that others wear and look nice in, look completely gaudy and cheap on me. I can’t lose anymore weight to make a difference on my bust size. I won’t get surgery but I have been working on my body image issues which my shyness and upbringing did a number on. People’s comments don’t usually devastate me as they once did but Sarah obviously tried her best to break me down.- Thank you to all for clothing suggestions. I will definitely look into tailoring some tops and have spent some time checking out Bravissimo which looks great.- In hindsight, I should have confronted Sarah more sternly in the past but I guess I was trying to avoid conflict. Others have suggested I may have allowed her to gaslight me which may be true. I just want to move on at this point.**Update 2:**The coworker (*Lucy), who keeps in contact with Sarah and told me earlier that Sarah may have reported me to HR, has just phoned to tell me that Sarah has suffered a serious panic attack. Lucy does not want to take sides but has suggested I reconsider taking drastic action. Sarah is too unwell to talk to me herself but has asked I drop my complaint and she will drop hers, citing the whole thing as a misunderstanding and stress-induced disagreement. I have had panic attacks before in my life and I seriously felt like I was going to die. It’s a horrible feeling and if Sarah has honestly just had one herself, I don’t want to push her too far. I still want to address her comments over the video call but I’m wondering if I should just drop the other complaints. Sarah has asked to move teams so we don’t directly work with one another but it doesn’t seem she wants to apologise yet. And just to clarify to people who assume I was wearing a bikini top or boob tube during the meeting, I wasn’t. It was a short sleeved plain tshirt which hugged my breasts more than my usual baggy tops. I don’t like to hold grudges and I think getting her fired during a time like this may be a shitty thing to do. I feel she has already punished herself by displaying this fucked up behaviour to others and losing a lot of respect from coworkers. If we don’t ever have to interact with one another, I’m up for that. I have a suspicion that Sarah may have found this post and read it which I thought I would feel bad about but I really don’t care.**Last Update:**I’m not dropping any of the complaints. Sarah (fuck you Michelle) and I have spoken, and although it started off promising, she is mentally unhinged and without a conscience. I did not realise how deep her hatred runs. Not only did she mock all those things I had told her in confidence about the way my family treated me growing up, she accused me of fucking every guy from work to get ahead. Now I know where some of those fake office rumours about me came from. I’ve been such a naive idiot and allowed my shyness and aversion to conflict to stop me from fighting people who manipulate and walk all over me. I don’t need this misery in my life. If she’s reading this, get professional help immediately. I know you desperately fancy John and, as you said, despise the way he looks at me. I know it bothers you that he took my side and has been a great support. Maybe I will go for drinks with him when lockdown ends. If I don’t make any new updates, just assume that the right person was reprimanded and faced the consequences of their words and actions."
69,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I called off my wedding because my fiance does not want my son to bring his boyfriend to the wedding?,32348,btvqmi,4858,"My son was born when I was only 15 years old, and I’ve been a single dad since I was 18. It was hard living for a long time money-wise but I always tried to do best by my son. Today I own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. He came out to me when he was 14 years old and I’ve always been supportive of him and his identity. I’ve been with my fiancé now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son – at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. My son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and I’ve gotten to know him really well. However my fiancé told me recently that she does not want my son’s boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. That if they found out, they would have a complete fit. This really bothered me because I refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. What is going to happen in the future? When my son gets married himself? Will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? He’s my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. When I told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that I was being selfish and over-dramatic – that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. I told her that this was unacceptable and that I was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. It’s my wedding too and I was his boyfriend there. After that I got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn’t been discussed again. However, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. I do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. I love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. I told my brother and he said that I was being the asshole here – that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it’s unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his “step grandparents” in the future anyway. I still don’t feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. Would I be the asshole if I did this? Am I being unreasonable here?"
70,Not the A-hole,AITA for writing a bad yelp review about my childs daycare calling them racist,32306,lqk99w,1368,**UPDATE: i haven't logged into this account in a while but i tried to update and it got removed so i will just copy and paste it into here****I decided to ask my daughter how she feels about all of this and she said that she likes going to daycare and that all of her friends are there. I got a lot of nice replies and awards and i am very thankful for all of the support i have been getting. I'm having my daughter come home from school with her grandma instead of the daycare. I emailed the owner of the daycare franchise (not the manager) and they are very furious and have decided to let go the people who were participating in this. I am not going to report them yet unless they do this again and i am in a group chat with the parents and i told them to all tell me if they do this to their kids again and i am afraid that reporting the place could make a lot of the people who didn't know about this lose their jobs. Turns out the manager and her friends were just power tripping. I am not very confrontational and my husband also said reporting would not be a good idea since if they close down other parents would lose childcare.**A while ago my daughter\[8f\] was complaining about her daycare because they were not giving her sunscreen. she asked for sunscreen but they said that black people do not need sunscreen but they actually do. before covid they went on a field trip and they made all the black kids sit in the sun and made the white kids sit in the shade because it would damage their skin or some bs. i talked to the ladies at the daycare and they said that it was justified but said if we brought in a doctors note they would give her sunscreen. i made my daughter take it to school and let her share it with other kids but then the teacher took it saying she was not allowed to do that without permission. The other day she came home with a bad sunburn and her skin was peeling and i had enough and wrote that they were racist and segregating kids and that she could get skin cancer because they are forcing her in the sun without sunscreen. i sent the lady in charge articles about cancer and that black people can get sunburned and sent her names of the workers who enforced this. she said that they were under her orders and that she was right because we have more protection against this and said that i was blowing this out of proportion and asked me to take my review down. I am seriously thinking of contacting a news channel about this. my friend said i am being a karen for complaining publicly and that black people have melanin so that gives them lots of protection that other kids dont haveEDIT: we live in the deep south
71,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my husband that I won't punish my daughter for speaking another language in the house because it upsets his son?,32245,if3rmj,2789,"This is a shitty situation but here we go. Me and my daughter, Anya, are from India. Our native language is Hindi. She 11 years old now. Her father died when she was 5 and I immigrated to states because everyone was trying to get me remarried to a 60 year old sleazebag because ""oh no. How ever will a woman live or raise a child alone"". I stated dating my now-husband when Anya was 6. He had a 5 year old son, Ben (50% custody). Me, Anya, Ben, Husband and Ben's mum get along really well. The kids were very well adjusted and they were genuinely happy when we got married. Whenever tensions arose, we dealt with them patiently. Let's just say after walking through the minefield of Indian family/drama, diffusing these toy bombs were very easy. Anya has a habit of talking in Hindi when she gets really excited. Sometimes, while talking to me, she starts talking in Hindi without even realising it. This wasn't a problem. If she does that while others are around, I would remind her and she would revert back to English. Few months ago, Ben's mum passed away and he came to live with us full time. He has a room already and we put Ben into therapy immediately. A week ago, Ben walked in when me and Anya were cooking and we were talking in Hindi and he started crying. He told me he is feeling bad that he can't understand what we are saying. I hugged him and consoled him and assured him that we didn't do it to exclude him purposefully. And then Anya started crying and apologised. The whole thing was just heartbreaking. Since then, Anya has been making concious efforts to talk only in English and I can tell that it puts Ben at ease. Yesterday, however, she was frustrated and started lamenting about school work in Hindi to me. Me and Anya were in the living room and Ben and husband were in the kitchen and they heard it. Later that night, my husband told me how he thinks we must start thinking about giving punishments whenever she speaks in Hindi unconsciously until Ben starts feeling better. I was horrified at this suggession. I have never pulled the ""She is my daughter, not yours"" card. But this is the hill I am willing to die on and use that card if necessary. Whether he likes it or not, it's her first language. Expecting her to always converse in her second language, even when she is feeling some extreme emotions is just cruel. Especially after she is genuinely making an effort to make Ben feel more comfortable. It's almost like punishing for her heritage or for her being Indian. Of course, this is a huge point of conflict between me and my husband. I think it's unfair to do this to Anya, even temporarily. He thinks me and Anya are unnecessarily making feel Ben bad while he is mourning his mother, while we can try and prevent it. Both of us are conflicted here. Who is the asshole here?"
72,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to RSVP to my sister’s wedding because I’m required to write an “application essay” just to attend?,32181,hzyy7b,3799,"Yeah I know this sounds insane but I’m living in it. So my sister is getting married next February, destination wedding no less. I have doubts whether this wedding is actually going to happen with the pandemic and everything but she is totally set on moving forward.Anyways because of the pandemic, her original venue has made her cut down on guests because they’re cutting capacity by half. As a result she’s sending out “re-invites” that asks everyone to RSVP again. But in order to figure out who to invite and who to cut, she’s asking all confirmed guests to submit two 250-word “essays” to two questions. The gist is that they’ll use these essays to choose who can come or not, based on people’s enthusiasm. People who don’t write the essays at all will be automatically disqualified.I just feel really insulted by all of this. The questions aren’t even pandemic-related, its broad topics like ”why do you still want to celebrate this day with us?” And “what will attending our wedding mean to you specifically?” So she’s blatantly looking for people to kiss ass and tell her why they REALLY want to go. Anyways I told her in advance I’m not writing 500 words on why I NEED to attend her wedding, spend my own money on plane tickets/hotels, and buy her a present. This has really rubbed her and my parents the wrong way. She’s said that to keep things fair if I don’t fill out the RSVP correctly I won’t be saved a spot. I said fine with me. Then my parents said if I don’t show up I’m going to be in big fucking trouble with all our relatives so just write the essays. AITA if I stay stubborn on this? I’m already annoyed at the thought of spending thousands and coming home to quarantine. But I will not belt out 500 words on how this is totally my choice. AITA?Edit: I’m 27F. I don’t live with family but she is my only sister.Edit2: Sister has framed these essays as “surveys” but there’s a word limit requirement so if you don’t reach it on the google forms you can’t even submit. Parents think this is perfectly reasonable, nice even, because sister is letting everyone have the chance to attend."
73,Not the A-hole,AITA for not forgiving my(27) fiance(28) for missing the birth of our daughter?,32133,hvzvwg,2247,"My husbands girl best friend (we'll call her Madison) has never liked me, for reasons I guess I will never know. Anyways my fiance (we'll call him Michael) and I were having a hangout with a little bit of the friends that we shared. It was nearing the end of the night and Madison was the only ""friend"" left when Madison came out crying with Michael looking angry, (I was around nine months pregnant at the time). The thing that really caught my attention is when Michael called me a raging b\*\*\*\* and a c\*\*t. Myself being a hormonal pregnant women started crying at the name calling. I asked through my tears what was going on and he then proceeds to tell me about a text message I sent to Madison. In the message I told her to f\*\*\* off and about how Michael and I would not allow her near our child. I will admit that I did send this, but it was taken completely out of context, I only sent this text after the many racist text messages that she sent me talking about my child and I. I am biracial. Instead of hearing me out Michael kicked me out of the house that we shared (his name was on the lease). Without arguing I decided to leave not wanting to start anything else, as I was walking out the door I felt a cramp in my lower abdomen. I thought nothing of this because I was not due for another three weeks, when I flinched from the pain Michael told me to stop faking. On the way to my moms house I felt a gush of water and immediately turned the car around so that I would make it to the hospital. While driving I took out my phone to call Michael but my call was quickly declined. At this point I was in to much pain to call anyone else and arrived at the hospital. I pushed for two hours without an epidural and gave birth to a beautiful baby girl named Grace Noel. Giving birth without my fiance by my side was the final straw for me, I decided to do something and post all the hurtful messages Madison sent me on facebook. Maybe 45 min-1 hour later Michael calls me asking me if we could talk, I inform him about my whereabouts and he shows up about  42 minutes later. He has tried to apologize multiple times, But I dont think I can forgive him. I went through the pain of pushing out an 8 pound baby by myself all because he chose to believe his best friend without listening to his fiance.AITA for not wanting to forgive him??"
74,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my male friend that he’s shit at sex,31934,h0jty3,2393,"One of my (24F) male friends, I’ll call Jack (25M), is a bit of a lad and very good looking. Jack basically thinks that lad points are important, he’s always going on about how many girls he’s been with and how high is body count is. I lived with him in a house share for a while and whenever he bought a girl home, he’d make sure to parade her around by introducing her, spend 15-20mins in his room having sex, then come out and strut around naked or in his boxers..yes he really would. I remember saying a few times why are you out here, you have a beautiful girl in your room and you’re not in there with her?This behaviour was pretty common for him and even though he was an almighty douche, we were still friends. Anyway after about 8 months of living together, after a drunken night, me and Jack ended up in bed together. Honestly it was terrible and having slept with him I realised something. Jack had a big dick (which I knew because of his strutting) but he thought that having a big dick automatically meant he was good at sex. Like it just immediately made him amazing in bed. Our sex was shit, like hands down the worst sex I’d ever had. No foreplay, he left lights and tv on, then unceremoniously shoved himself inside me. The whole thing was basically a race for him to get inside me as quickly as possible. Maybe 10 minutes of uncomfortable jackhammering then he was done. The next morning I was really sore because 1. I wasn’t wet at all 2. His dick was big. But because I was sore he took that as him doing a bang up job. Anyway that experience was a few years ago, and even after all this time, Jack is still the same lad he was and still fucks girls like they’re lined up on a conveyor belt for him. Back to the present. Recently, my husband and I hosted a bbq in our garden as gatherings are now allowed. Jack came over as he’s in our mutuals group. Of course after a while Jack starts going on about the girls he’s fucked, and even showing up another girl at the party by telling people he’d fucked her. It’s then he turns to me and asks if I can prove to the lads how “fire” he is at sex. Slightly embarrassed but also angry he even mentioned me, I straight up told him he was shit. Basically worst sex I ever had, I then went onto say what happened and that he only has sex just to say that he’s had sex. It wasn’t fun, pleasurable or enjoyable and for the record I didn’t come. Amazingly enough, two other girls also backed up what I was saying. Saying their nights with him were pretty much the same to how I described it. Jack got defensive and angry but we wouldn’t drop it. He eventually left absolutely fuming. My husband, who knows I slept with him years before said I was insensitive, especially as it seems jack relies heavily on the lad/sex God persona he’s created. I don’t think so, it was about time Jack was called out for being shit in bed and maybe use this to learn how to actually have sex.  All the boys in the group think I’m an ass for calling Jack out, me and the girls disagree.EDIT: - Holy cow this got way more attention than I thought it would! Thanks for all the comments.l and thank you kind strangers for the awards!!Should clear a few things up. A lot of people asking why I was or am friends with Jack. I was back then, because honestly at times he was a decent guy, just blanketed by a douchey exterior. After I moved out of the house, we fell out of close contact but are still hovering in mutual friend circles. I’m not directly friends with him now but he’s still a friend of a friend and we are normally civil.EDIT #2: I really don’t get why people are misunderstanding the story. For the record I did not cheat on my husband. Jack and I had a one night stand together years ago while we were at uni. I wouldn’t consider him my friend now but we still have mutuals from different social circles and we do occasionally still see one another.INFO: Basically my friend group (close/mutual/extended) all knew or knew of each other at uni. I’m British and now live in the states. I attended Uni between the ages of 18 - 21. At 19 I went to the states for a year abroad, and the sister Uni is where I met my now husband. Jack is American and was an international student doing exchange, I was first year he was second year. I, a first year, ended up living with Jack because I decided to go to uni last minute, and as Halls were full, ended up responding to a house share ad (a lot of students drop out after making a house share commitment so these ads are common)I actually met my husband (also American) through Jack, as Jack was one of my only known contacts when I moved to the states. (My British uni and his American uni were linked) I met my husband a year AFTER I slept with Jack. I could not possibly have had any idea that my housemate and one night stand would go on to introduce me to my future husband. My husband knew Jack and I slept together because unfunnily enough, Jack brought it upon our first meeting.Living together, Jack and I mainly bonded over weed and raves, and although he was sometimes somewhat decent, looking back I’m disgusted at our so called friendship. I could write an essay on how he treated me. > If anyone is interested in an update, I posted it here."
75,Not the A-hole,AITA for insulting a girl's weight after she went off on me for touching her purse on a crowded train?,31893,cmcou6,3199,"Train is packed, it's hot, I'm tired and looking for a place to sit. Everything was occupied, but at one point I see an old lady get up and start making her way to the doors. I went over to sit in new place, but found a purse in it instead, belonging to the girl in the window seat. I asked her if she could move the purse, but she didn't respond. I noticed she had headphones in, so I figured I'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as I'm sitting down.As soon as I touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck I was doing. I explained. She then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. I told her I knew for a fact she was alone because I just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. So I started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.This released an even bigger tirade and series of ""what the fuck is your problem""-s. I saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so I figured I'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her ""Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. My bad, I'll get up now"". I got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as I was walking away.I noticed some people gave me dirty looks, but others were chuckling, so I kinda wondered if I stepped too much out of line there."
76,Not the A-hole,AITA for allowing two teenagers to be spit on by a llama?,31812,cyt2nl,2844,"I work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama.I told them ""you might want to cut that out! Llamas spit in self-defense."" But they kind of laughed my warning off.Now, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.The llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a ""warning spit"" (just saliva) and they went ""eww"" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.Finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in.To make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.AITA? The girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. Maybe it was...I knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but I wanted the lesson to sink in as well."
77,Not the A-hole,AITA for gifting my sister pictures of my dog?,31763,ef49r2,2621,"I'm a bit of a jackass I will admit, but hear me out. So today I was at my parent's house to celebrate Christmas Eve with my side of the family (as this year I will be spending Christmas with my girlfriend's this year). Anyways, we opened presents up early this morning. Something I should note about my sister is that she LOVES her children. Which is great and I do love my nephews, but every year she gets me magnets, pictures, blankets and pretty much anything she can plaster her kids on. While it's nice, I don't have a shrine at my house dedicated to them and I know this might sound selfish, but I don't really want them as I don't know what to do with them. They end up in a drawer or something, cause one year she got me a large tapestry thing with her kids on it, and it was HUGE. Obviously I didn't want to hang it up as it quite literally covered the entire wall. I never say anything to her as I don't want to offend her and ruin Christmas.So that's when I had the genius idea of doing the same thing but with my dog. I put him in a little tie, took his picture and put it in a frame. I love my dog as my child, so I figured I'd gift it to my sister. (I also got her a $25 Starbucks card as she's obsessed with them and I wasn't trying to be petty). Anyways, she opens it up and her face drops. Then she goes to me and says, ""what the fuck am I supposed to do with this?"" Without a thought I said, ""same thing I do with yours, it'll look good on your coffee table"". Long story short, she got mad, my family is pretty much on my side expect for a couple of people who thought it was funny but in the end ""dogs aren't comparable to humans"". Which I don't necessarily agree with and wasn't the point of the gift, but whatever, I thought it was funny, but I need unbiased opinons, AITA?"
78,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my daughter to cancel her marriage?,31747,itd4ok,2455,"I have a daughter(27) who was with her boyfriend for 7 years and they  got engaged not long ago(just a small party, not many guests). She always talks to me about how she loved him, how he always listens to he and he was made for her. I have agreed with her, since I found i=him to be a good natured man, he was kind and humble and was always respectful to our family. We've met his parents for dinner twice or thrice and they hit me as a little sexist, asking questions to my wife like ""I don't know why you're working, isn't that the husband's job? Its the mothers job to be taking care of the children"".  Now that they wanted to make it more serious, they planned a marriage. Anyways we have been planning about the marriage, and one day her boyfriend comes to me and says that his parents want to talk to me. I was going to call my daughter too, but he said that she wasn't allowed. I went with him and his parents started talking with me about DOWRY. I was confused and said that there was no dowry and in 2020 who even gives dowry?? But boyfriend and his parents started lecturing me about how necessary it was and how my daughter would be a stay at home wife(my daughter has told me that she wants to continue her dreams so I don't know what this is). Anyways they told me that I should give it a thought and told me not to tell my daughter for the time being. However I immediately told my daughter about it, and she started crying saying she didn't know that her boyfriend was so sexist. She asked me what she could do now, and I told her that she wasn't being forced and could cancel her marriage if she didn't want it. Well, that is exactly what happened and now her boyfriend and his parents are calling me saying I took away the love of his life etc... On top of that, some of her friends (some were bridesmaids) said that I was a asshole for breaking up what would've been a ""healthy marriage"". But its my daughter's happiness that matters. AITA?"
79,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my autistic brother the truth when he asked me why women don’t like him?,31748,gbl3wk,2437,"I’ve got a younger brother (24) with Aspergers and he’s very high functioning albeit with his quirks. Recently I’ve moved back home during the stay at home orders to look after my parents. My brother still lives with them. I find out he’s been trying to date in recent months and confessed it’s been pretty unsuccessful for him. He even got to go on a first date but his date literally got up and left after about a half hour. I know exactly the reason why and it’s not flattering. For one thing my parents coddled him since he was a kid because he was on the spectrum and was the only boy in our family. My mom in particular always told him he was smarter and more advanced than everyone else who’s neurotypical. This has led to his belief today that he genuinely is smarter than everyone else, especially women who he thinks are inherently irrational, illogical people. So I know how he interacts with women like me or his other sisters. He tends to say very hurtful things first and when we get upset, he will then say things like “you are being irrational/hysterical/illogical, I’m just being honest and you can’t accept it.” This is like his catch phrase over the years and drives us absolutely INSANE. Anyways when he asked me I basically said, “listen the truth is your way of talking to women can come across as extremely demeaning and borderline sexist.” I told him he acts like he can read every woman perfectly when he’s pretty much always wrong. This struck the wrong nerve with him and he later complained to my parents that I attacked him over things he can’t control. Now I’m in hot water for “ruining his confidence” and I feel both bad and kinda relieved at the same time. This was the first time in my life I told him how annoying his behavior is because growing up our mom always blamed us whenever he got upset. But maybe I was too harsh? AITA for telling him what I said?"
80,Not the A-hole,AITA for laughing uncontrollably at my son when he asked me to replace a Christmas gift he broke out of anger?,31594,ei9igg,3456,"I know I likely am, but the extend of which I'm unsure about. My son is almost 17. This Christmas we bought him an expensive computer gaming chair, as he plays a lot of online multiplayer shooters. My son has some anger issues, which he's currently in therapy for, and these shooters tend to bring out his temper more than normal. However, for the past few months he's been keeping it together well, so I figured the chair might be a fair present. I was wrong, because the day after Christmas he was gaming, started to have bad luck and apparently people in-game were fucking with him because he was losing his patience. This culminated in him screaming insults and then picking up his chair and slamming it into the ground, breaking the back of it.After talking him down, we had a very serious conversation about him no longer being allowed to play multiplayer games while under my roof until his therapist feels comfortable with his progress, talked about coping mechanisms, etc. However, I made it very clear this was unacceptable and he would be grounded. We've had these heart-to-hearts many times, so it's not like every time he has an outburst I'm making light of it. It's a serious issue and treated like such.However, when he came to me later that day and told me he'd like me to replace the chair because it was a gift, he ""really liked it"" and ""it would only be fair"", the frustration, disbelief and disappointment in his behavior boiled over and I started laughing hysterically. As in a full laughing fit, barely able to breathe or talk. The more he'd plead his case, the harder I'd laugh, repeatedly asking him how it was ""fair"" in his mind to have me replace a gift I paid for that he broke in anger.This obviously pissed him off more, which led to him getting emotional, but I just couldn't seem to stop myself. I tried walking out of the room and asking him to drop it but every time he'd say ""but I need a chair!"" or ""What am I supposed to do now"" I'd laugh again. I tried explaining that I'm not laughing at his feelings, I'm laughing at how absurd it is for him as a teenager to expect me to replace shit he can't be bothered to treat with respect and then whine about it when he broke it.He's still pissed about it, and feels slighted. I feel bad for laughing, and honestly wonder if I had some sort of mini-stress break myself, because it's never happened before and I couldn't seem to stop. But at the same time, I stand by the fact that his request *was* ridiculous enough to make most people *want* to laugh. How badly did I fuck up?"
81,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling someone that his art sucks and he won't amount to much in life in front of his friends and family.,31526,9wg9ep,3340,"I have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that I hang out with almost every day. We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. I never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said ""Einstein"" once and John interrupted him to say, ""I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?"". I once put up a snapchat story saying, ""I love college football!"", and he replied to my story with ""It's called gridiron you moron"".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. On one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went ""I'm a Biomed Engineer"". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.Every time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, ""What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing"". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. Over the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, ""damn M0shka you famous now"" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like ""His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent."" At this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). Last week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, ""I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo"". To which he got angry again and said, ""I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you"". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. That's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, ""Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*"" His dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? "
82,Not the A-hole,AITA for making my daughter sleep in a tent,31501,k9y7o3,1990,"I (34F) am a single mother to two girls, 'Jasmine' (16F) and 'Jessica' (14F). Their dad died when I was pregnant with Jess, and I had to work hard. We hit rock bottom, and I was barely making paycheque to paycheque but I managed to get a degree, become successful and we live well. Point is, I know how fucking hard it is to be at the bottom of society, and my daughters know this, which is why I was livid at my daughter's actions.Yesterday, Jasmine showed me a video of Jessica cussing a homeless man out and telling him, 'stop asking me for money, you'd earn it yourself if you weren't so fucking lazy and spending what you earned on substances.' When the homeless man complained about the cold (we live in NE England), Jessica responded 'Yeah people camp for fun, even in December, you can't complain, you're living someone's holiday.' Fury was an understatement for what I felt, as I thought I had raised an empathetic daughter.Along with finding the homeless man and making her apologise and help pay for a hotel room for a night for him (she paid £20), as well as signing her up to volunteer at a food bank - I decided to take her up on her offer of sleeping outside. I locked her bedroom door so she couldn't go in, put a sign on it saying *Closed for the holidays,* pitched a tent in the garden and filled it with blankets and the sleeping bag I used when I was camping in Norway on a family holiday as a teen (aka really bloody thermal). I slept in the room closest to the garden for that night so I was nearby if anything was to go wrong. She was reluctant to do it, but chose it over the option of not having access to her phone until the Christmas holidays are over.In the morning, she was crying about how horrible it was to wake up on a cold mat and get disrupted sleep due to birds. After comforting her, I asked her would she like to do that everyday like the homeless man. It struck a cord with her and she was crying over her actions, while even after the £20 she was rolling her eyes and her apology was not sincere. This afternoon, I came home from work to Jessica making a big meal to donate to the homeless people who live on the road near our house. I was proud of how she turned over a new leaf, and after taking the food to the people, my sister came over. Apparently, my nephew and Jessica were talking at school, and he asked her about her plans for the afternoon, and she said that she was going to cook for the homeless. My nephew asked what triggered that, and Jess told him everything, which he relayed back to his mum. My sister said that my punishment was too harsh, and just the £20 and the food bank would have done the trick, and I was acting irrationally due to my past. Now I'm second guessing myself. AITA?"
83,Not the A-hole,AITA for suing my ex?,31492,h9emck,2625,"So I dated a YouTuber.We went out for about a year and it was alright but they were so emotionally invested in their channel that they constantly neglected me and made me feel like I wasn't a priority.Not really important why we broke up, but we broke up.Then I get a bunch of messages from friends about 3 months later telling me to go to their channel. I'm pretty much done with them but I do and I realise they made a video about me where they claim I was emotionally abusive.I continued to get messages from strangers telling me how awful a person I was and how they hoped I died through various means.So I sued my ex.It ruined them. I knew they were financially in a bad spot and they likely couldn't afford court fees but the case dragged.They made a video about not being able to afford court costs and such and how it was going to ruin them.After which a bunch of friends started telling me to just let it go and move on but I had sunk money into the case as well. It wasn't cheap for me either so I didn't just let it go.Eventually the judge ruled in my favor and I received a total of nothing from my ex......But it meant I could link to the result in the comments section of every video she tried to frame me as the bad guy because in our state, court proceedings are public record.Suddenly her viewership dropped and she blamed me for ruining her life.A bunch of my friends said I went too far and should've just taken the court win and left her alone.Was I the asshole?"
84,Not the A-hole,Aita: For giving my deceased son's college fund to his best friend instead of my nephew?,31461,jrrmdy,3384,"This has been causing a conflict with my entire family. And they think that I'm being selfish and unreasonable. Let me explain first.I M39 lost my son in 2019 due to a chronic heart condition. He was 15 years old. It was devastating and I just couldn't take it especially when my family did little to nothing to support me during these difficult times. They didn't bring my son meals when he was at the hospital. They didn't let me go home and rest even for a few hours. They didn't take care of other things while I had a lot to deal with I wasn't offered any help just words. They'd just talk but do nothing.Despite the struggle. I've created an account for my son's college fund and kept putting whatever I could get at the time and me and my son would talk about that a lot. He was depressed but always believed that he was going to get better and continue his education and attend college.I started saving money To keep him motivated and to make him feel like he could be like any other kid with hopes for a good future. He had a very close friend that's about the same age as him. They were friends for 5 years, and I can't express how his presence in my son's life helped him through the worst days, sometimes his friend would spend the night with us and try to get my son to do activities and lighten up his mood all the time. To be frank his friend was closer to him than his own family.He never stopped visiting and asking how I'm doing after my son's death. He'd show me handmade projects he made for my son and as a way to remember him and we'd sometimes just sit and talk together or cry together. Last week. While I was with my family my sister asked me what I was going to do with my son's college money. I didn't wanna mention this but since she asked I told her that I will be giving the money to my son's friend. She barely even recognized his friend and was confused and said that my nephew deserves this money since he's family. My mom agreed that I wasn't thinking straight and that I should help the people close to me-family and that my nephew has a right to go to college and I was wrong for giving this ""opportunity"" away to someone else.I didn't know what to say they kept pointing out that I was making a mistake and how my nephew will resent me if he finds out. Thing is my nephew wasn't close to my son I don't even know why he'd be bothered. My sister went on about not being able to afford my nephew's college I told her this was my decision and I felt more comfortable that way. She started lashing out, constantly texting me constantly wanting to talk to me and ending up arguing. When I snapped she had my mom calling me basically guilttripping me and telling me I'm wrong and that I needed to think about this.It's just too much pressure and I'm feeling lost and unable to figure out how to deal with this."
85,Not the A-hole,AITA for throwing out my mom after she threw out my weed?,31402,hm9j4o,2198,"Throwaway in case someone I know sees this, don't want them to know my main reddit account.So I am a 30 year old man. I'm single and live alone in a house that I own. A few months ago you know what happened and my mom lost her job. So I decided to let her stay with me.I have a medical marijuana card and smoke every day. I knew my mom disliked weed so I warned her before she moved in that I would be smoking weed daily and would not stop for her. She agreed, and only asked that I smoke outside. Which I thought was a relatively reasonable request weed has a strong smell and many people don't like it.At first this worked out fine at first. But she started making remarks about how I should quit, ect. I mostly just ignored them/brushed them off. Then it evolved to her demanding that I quit. As if I were still  a child she could issue orders to. I refused and told her that she can move out if she doesn't like it. She started crying and saying that I don't love her, I have a problem, ect. The next day, I come home from work to find her waiting for me. She explained that she had flushed my weed (a little less than an ounce) for my own good. And then demanded that I go to treatment. Well, predictably, I was furious. And not even really about not having the weed anymore. It is pretty cheap (I usually buy ounces for $125) and I can easily get more. It was about her total lack of respect for me. I'm an adult, own my own house, have a good job, and have approval from the state to legally purchase and possess marijuana.  So someone I'm doing a huge favor for demanding that I stop and throwing out my stuff when I refused is extremely outrageous to me. No matter if she pushed me out of her vagina 30 years ago.Anyway, we argued about this for a while and it became clear to me that she was not sorry at all and that she would probably do it again. So I told her she can't live with me anymore. I gave a month, but she has already packed all her shit and drove to my brothers house a couple hours away. She obviously thinks I'm a huge asshole. So does my brother. But I think that's mostly because she is his problem now."
86,Not the A-hole,AITA for banning my husband’s female friend from our house?,31306,hkh0dd,2289,"Throwaway account, English is not my first language, I’m on mobile - I apologise. I (27F) have been married with my husband (M32) for three years and haven been dating for a little over 5. My husband has this friend (F31) ‘Mary’. They’ve known each other since they were in high school and she’s considered ‘one of the boys’, if you may. That basically means she’s always invited to all the fishing trips and stuff, which I don’t mind at all, I trust my husband. Well, my problems with Mary started when she first found out I’m half Romanian. It started kinda innocently, with her asking me to say certain words, teach her some insults etc which didn’t necessarily bother me, but it usually put me on the spot whenever we were out with my husband’s group of friends. It only escalated to her googling stuff about Romania and asking me ‘are you a vampire? do you bite your husband by the neck?’ to ‘are you a gypsy? I bet you’ve got some of that gypsy blood in you’ (which is just blatantly racist)Last week, me and my husband organised a mini BBQ with our friends and Mary was invited by my husband despite me telling him she makes me uncomfortable. He said he had talked to her about her remarks and she’s been understanding so it’s unlikely she’ll say something this time.It was midnight and there were about 4 of us left and I accidentally spilled some red wine on Mary’s jeans when I tripped over a carpet. All hell broke loose. Mary started saying that I’m a witch and I’m trying to ruin her life and this whole thing is part of my ritual and I’m just a ‘immigrant gypsy trying to ruin my husband’s life’ and I’ve poisoned my husband against her. I started crying and profusely apologising. When she wouldn’t drop it, I kicked her out and banned her from ever coming to my house again. AITA for doing this? My husband insists that Mary was just drunk and talking nonsense and he would talk to her. He also told me I’m way too sensitive about my heritage and I’m an a-hole for banning her. Mary has since given me a half hearted apology but I’m still not ok with her.EDIT: I guess this is the update some of you wanted. Sorry I’m still a mess and idk how coherent I am. We’ve talked. He admitted to being in and out of an affair with Mary in the first 2y of our relationship and she wanted to win him back I guess. I called my mom to come help me pack some stuff and im out. Thats it. Mary can have him I’ve been gaslit for years and it took a reddit post to realise. Oh the irony. thank you reddit.EDIT2 and probably the last one for a period of time: A lot of people seemed suspicious of Mary and my husband’s friendship/relationship etc and have asked if I ever suspected anything. No, I didn’t. Me and my husband had (or I thought we had) a very strong relationship, based on communication and honesty (guess it only applied to me). Also, Mary is very close with all the boys in the said friendship group. The other wives raised concerns in the past but they’ve all been shut down by the boys in the group or by Mary herself. I guess I always respected their friendship group because they were very close for so long and it felt unfair to change that because of me. As far as I’m aware, the other wives feel the same - plus Mary has been in a LD relationship for about 2 years and always claimed she’s focusing on her career, she’s too busy etc so none of us ever saw her as a potential threat. But now it just makes me think there could be more to this story. But I’m tired, as of right now, I am just exhausted. My Romanian witch blood won’t let me live until I find out the whole truth but I need time.Thank you to everyone who took the time to reply to my post, message me (even the ones that insulted me further - it was semi-funny) and thank you for the awards! I’m sending virtual hugs to all of you! Aveți grijă de voi!"
87,Not the A-hole,"AITA for disowning my brother when he came out as gay, because of how he's treating his wife?",31241,ggmc1h,1775,"I (21f) have a brother (28) who came out as gay last month. He has been married to my best friend's big sister (24) for four years, they have 2yo twin daughters together. I'm really close with her, so I've been trying to stay neutral in what has become a messy separation. My brother told his wife he's gay by sitting her down, and saying he had been sleeping with two different men for about six months. He said he is now sure that he feels romantic feelings for men, and also told her he has been sleeping with random men from Grindr for over a year behind her back. She obviously freaked out, asked him how he could do this, why didn't he tell her when he started having the feelings, etc. He said that he's always thought he was gay but he didn't want to come out because it might affect his career. She asked him what about the effect on her life? She is now a single mother to two toddlers. He was essentially very angry that she wasn't supportive of this, so he kicked her out of the house, with the kids. After she eventually found a place to stay, my brother moved in one of the men he has been having an affair with. Since then, he has had very little contact with the kids, as in speaking to them on the phone once a week maybe. He has expressed that he still doesn't want to be public about coming out, so he posted on Facebook that he has separated from his wife because they aren't in love anymore and hinted SHE was the unfaithful one (posting things like 'yeah, seems like someone in this relationship wasn't satisfied with just one man') and is basically being a dick.I told him a couple weeks ago that he's a fucking asshole and I don't want to be involved with him anymore because I think it's disgusting that he's treated his wife like this. I told him I get that you have to come out in your own time, but you don't need to kick her out, ignore your kids and berate her, and you don't need to make comments that people will assume mean she was being unfaithful (he said this was a joke about him having two partners now? still fucked up). He said I'm being a homophobic asshole, and that I don't know how hard it is to come out. He said that if I don't accept him, I'm a bigot. He made mistakes and what not. I said maybe I will forgive him if he improves his behaviour to his wife, and he said he resents her for keeping him from sleeping with men for years. I gave up at this point. My sisters (17&24) both think I'm being homophobic, my mom agrees with me. AITA?"
88,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my boyfriend that his masculinity was fragile after he refused to buy me pads?,31209,gp0at9,1281,"Okay, throwaway because my boyfriend knows my other account. I (23f) moved in with my boyfriend (24m) of two years a couple months ago. We haven’t had any problems before this argument. Things had been going pretty well. Anyways, a couple days ago, I got my period. It came early and I had ran out of pads. I couldn’t leave to buy some because I bleed pretty heavily and I would’ve bled through my pants. So I asked my boyfriend if he could buy pads for me from the drugstore, because it was late. He immediately said no. I was shocked because I wasn’t really expecting that. I asked him why. He said that he didn’t want the cashier to see him buying pads. At this point I started laughing because that was hilarious. He wasn’t joking though. He just glared at me. I told him that the cashier would obviously know it wasn’t for him. Plus, the cashier would definitely not care what he was buying. He still refused. I told him that he could go to the self checkout machine if he was so insecure, but he said that he didn’t want anyone to see him with the pads because they’d think he was a “tr***y”. I told him that he was childish, and that his masculinity was really fragile if he couldn’t even buy pads for his own girlfriend. He got mad and went out. I had to bunch up toilet paper as a makeshift pad, wear black pants and a long cardigan and go buy the pads myself. My boyfriend has been ignoring me ever since. I’ve been thinking that maybe I might’ve pushed it too far.So AITA for telling my boyfriend that his masculinity was fragile after he refused to buy pads for me?*Edit*: *Wow, thank you for all your replies! I’m definitely going to have a serious talk with my boyfriend in the morning about this and we’ll see how it goes***UPDATE**: First off, thank you for all your awards, replies and stories, they all mean so much to me. I confronted my boyfriend an hour ago. We sat down together and I told him that I didn’t like how he acted about buying pads for me. He said that he didn’t feel like he had to, and that I could’ve “held it in” and drove to the drugstore to get the pads myself. I told him that you can’t “hold in” menstrual blood, but he insisted that I could’ve done it for a few minutes and that it wouldn’t be a big deal. We went back and forth over this so I just dropped it. I asked him (like most of you mentioned) what would happen when we have kids and he’d have to take care of me and buy me nipple cream, take me to the washroom, etc. He said that I would not need those things because I should be able to do them on my own after giving birth. He said that there wasn’t anything hard about using the bathroom and the only reason I’d need help is if I was a “cripple”. Then I asked him about the tr***y comment. He said that he didn’t understand why people would want to change the gender they were born in. That basically cemented everything for me. I felt completely betrayed and humiliated. I can’t believe I spent two years of my life with a guy who holds these views, and I can’t believe I was too oblivious to it. I just feel so dumb. I told him that we need to break up. He cussed at me and told me that I was exaggerating and that I was being a bitch. I told him that I would send him my half of this month’s rent (we live together but it was his appartement so we would split the bill). Then I packed my bags and drove to my parents house without saying another word. I’m gonna be staying with my parents until I sort myself out. I’m feeling really down right now, because I really did love him, but I also feel relieved. Again, thank you all for helping me out, and sending me encouraging messages. I appreciate it all."
89,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling the principal that his punishment was dumb and taking my daughter out for a fun day instead,31097,ipw5v4,1882,"This happened last year before the world fell apart, just asking out of boredom.My daughter was in second grade. She was in class and suddenly felt like she was going to vomit so she tried to run to the bathroom. She didn’t make it and vomited in the hallway. However she was sent to the office for running out of class without permission. The principal called me about this and I had to come in. He told me that she was being punished and was losing her privileges to go on the field trip the next week. I told him that was insane considering she did it because she was trying to keep from making a mess and she’s 7! She made a snap judgement that I think most people would make. On top of that, they sent her to the principal instead of the nurse. He refused to change the decision so I took my daughter out of school for the last 2 days of the week. Since she was missing the field trip I wanted her to have as much fun as possible so we went to an amusement park, the movies, and to paint pottery. She told her father about this during his visitation time and he got very angry at me for undermining the principal. AITA?"
90,Not the A-hole,AITA for making fun of a girl for her dad's 9/11 death?,31048,iqyn74,946,"I go to college in New York state. I am Muslim. I was very young when 9/11 happened, as were the rest of the people in my year.There's a girl in one of my classes who's father was in the World Trade Center. He died. Of course, this is very sad, and I pity the man, but not her. She's extremely racist. She hates everyone who isn't white or east asian. But she especially hates Muslims due to her father's passing. So of course, we don't talk.But today, September 11, was the day she exploded. I was wearing a hijab. She told me I should take it off out of respect for the victims and that it was the equivalent of a hat. I said no. She said that ""you Muslims did this, you need to take off the hijab to show respect."" I obviously told her no. Then she went on a very long Islamophobic rant that I can't entirely recall because this was hours ago. But I remember she concluded by saying that Islam took away her father, so she wants to take away Islam. (I'm still confused as to what she meant.)She made a few comments towards me, and I went on my phone to de escalate. She made more comments, I kept ignoring her. But then she said ""Yeah, you're not responding because you know I'm right"". I don't know why that set me off, but it did. I told her ""No, I'm just busy texting my DAD"". She left the room in tears. My classmates are saying that she was in the wrong, but what I said was unnecessarily cruel. Now, I don't think I'm TA, bc she started it, all I did was finish it.So, reddit, AITA??Yes, I am aware I have spelling mistakes. I speak Arabic at home.EDIT: For everyone wondering, the professor was out of the room. He'd already given us our lecture."
91,Not the A-hole,AITA for being honest about how I was bullied and how the teachers at my school did nothing about it while being interviewed by a current student?,31040,lb4bjq,2133,"I’m an author of mild success. I’m not incredibly popular, but my books sell enough. About 3 months ago, someone from my old high school reached out to see if a student could interview me.I responded that my time at the school wasn’t the happiest, but I would give the student responses relating to my career. We had a great chat. She started asking questions about my time at the school, but I redirected. She caught on to what I was doing and asked “I’m sensing that you’re hesitant to talk about your time at (school). Is that true?”I said let’s focus on the story, and she was like “Actually this could be a better story.”So I said y’know what, sure. Whatever. I don’t owe the school anything, I’m not being paid, and even though it’s been a long time and I’ve grown from what happened, it’s still worth talking about. I mentioned a few names in specific, and how I’d tried to ask for help and was blown off by everyone. Teachers at my school very strongly favored the girls in sports teams, and would often be buddy buddy with them and their parents.I mentioned a teacher who openly mocked the way I dressed, my lack of athleticism, etc. I brought up the time that a group of girls followed me around the school mooing at me and when I broke down crying because they wouldn’t stop and tried to tell a teacher, the teacher called me “Moolly” for the rest of the year and when I yelled “MY NAME IS MOLLY. *MOLLY”* she had me suspended for a week.She ended up publishing the whole interview. Nothing exactly went “viral” but there were posts on FB with a ton of comments and it caused some commotion in that community.A few weeks later, I was contacted by a school official who chastised me for bringing up old wounds and trying to paint veteran teachers as bad people when they were going through difficult times already. The teacher responsible for the “Moolly” incident had a local lifetime teaching award taken away from her after it all came out, so was it really worth it, and maybe did I remember things wrong?Finally, a handful of my old classmates (many of them stuck around town) found me and I was barraged with a ton of messages telling me that I’m ruining the reputation of the school and of several prominent community members, it was X years ago so why can’t I just get over it, etc. Some of them obviously haven’t changed.It was a long time ago, yes. I don’t know how I really feel about how this all went down though. I know times are tough for teachers right now. I didn’t set out to hurt anyone, I was just telling my truth. AITA?**Edited:** So... I didn't expect this to be so overwhelmingly in favor of NTA. I wasn't looking for validation, but wow. Some of you are sending me heartbreaking stories of bullying and being ignored or gaslit, and I am so sorry. Thank you all for the responses. If the Mods want to take this down because of validation or whatever, please do. I have my answer. "
92,Not the A-hole,AITA for selling my daughter's car after discovering her texting & driving?,30968,cb6xz4,6597,"When my daughter was 14, wife and I decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. There would be a ""contract"" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. The stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. We made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. We got the car, a 2012 Honda Civic. She has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. In a few months she will be off to college. Everything was going swimmingly. Until someone on that NextDoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. And lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. Once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. I was livid. My wife was the one who showed it to me. We found out there were more instances (from her Instagram Stories) and we decided... no.Wife and I up and sold the car. We didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. It's so unfair, I didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am I supposed to get to work, what about when I go to college? Well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. She tried to play the ""how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?"" card and I said ""Well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?"" and she just up and screamed. This has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. Her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. They've threatened that THEY will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. The car is already sold, so there's no going back. I think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. In terms of her going to college? Well, she made that choice. She had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price. So AITA?"
93,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting mad at my sister for not wanting me shirtless at her pool?,30924,hppclc,759,"My sister and her husband invited me over to their pool today for a little BBQ. I assumed it would just be me, my sister, her husband, my nephews, and my parents. But turns out they also invited her husband’s side of the family. When it was time to get in the pool, I changed into my swim trunks and removed my shirt. But my sister stopped me before I came out their house and asked to keep my shirt on because of my scars. She was referring to the scars from when I had my top (chest) surgery. I’m a trans guy. Had started transitioning 8 yrs ago and my surgery was 4 years ago. My scars have already faded and they’re pretty well hidden under my pecs. You’d have to look really close to even notice. I’ve been to their pool many times and she’s never said anything before so I was surprised. Every other guy including my dad were all shirtless in the pool. When I asked what the prob was with my scars she said she was uncomfortable with her in laws knowing I’m trans. My feelings were hurt but I was mainly pissed. She said she didn’t want her in laws to look at her differently if they found out about me. She told me not to make a big deal and to go with it. When she left, I went back inside to change because i wasn’t gonna go in the pool with a shirt on. I only had the one I came wearing because I didn’t expect her to ask me this. My mood was soured after that and I didn’t wanna be around her so I decided to leave. When I said bye to everyone they were all confused since I was only there less than an hour. My dad pulled me aside and asked why I was leaving early. I told him to ask my sister and left. An hour later my sister called me upset because she and my dad got into a fight. My parents were furious about what she told me and they ended up leaving early too. Now she’s angry at me for ruining the bbq and said I didn’t have to cause all this drama if I only did what she asked.What she said hurt me and I was no longer in a mood to be around her or anyone else, but I didn’t mean for all that to happen. Am I the asshole for getting mad at her and basically ruining their day?"
94,Not the A-hole,Aita for giving a woman a taste of her own behavior,30883,aphmhd,783,"I'm sitting at the airport and this older lady sat down right next to me and took her iPad out and starts watching a show quite loud. To me this is a foul in public however I just ignored it and put my earbuds in. After a while I made a phone call using my earbuds. Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.I was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. She said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. I said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. I have never seen someone storm off so mad. Quick edit. I turned the music video off almost immediately after she left. "
95,Not the A-hole,AITA for banning my roommate’s girlfriend after she kept insisting I was hitting on her?,30812,kwcbq0,1671,"I (24F) am a lesbian living with my good friend (25M). I own the apartment I’m renting out the extra room to him.A little over a month ago, he met a girl online, and they started dating. She is now at our place constantly. I’ll be honest, I’ve never really liked her. She was incredibly standoffish and rude to me from the beginning. I eventually learned it was because she thought I had a thing for my roommate. Even after he told her I was gay, apparently her only argument was, “she doesn’t look gay.”A few weeks ago, we were all drinking and hanging out at our place with a few close friends. I tried to mend fences by pulling the GF aside and telling her that I really am gay, I have no interest in stealing her boyfriend, and I hope we can be friends.She seemed to take this very well, and was OVERLY friendly with me the whole rest of the night. I thought she was just trying to make up for being so cruel at first.The next day, my roommate asked if we could talk. He said his GF feels uncomfortable around me after I “drunkenly hit on her.” Wuuut. I was not even remotely close to being drunk. Also, I am negatively attracted to her. Like, way less than zero. I find her insanely annoying.I tried to explain that I was trying to be nice, as I knew she didn’t particularly like me. I wanted to be civil if she was going to be around often. My roommate seemed skeptical, but he ultimately took my word for it and chalked it up to a miscommunication.Fast forward a week or so, the friend group is hanging out at our place again. The GF comes over, of course. I’m cordial to her, but I try to keep my distance so another “miscommunication” doesn’t happen.Towards the end of the night, one of our other friends comes up to me like, “Dude, what is going on? GF keeps telling everyone you’ve been checking her out and hitting on her all night?”Again, I was stunned. And at this point, incredibly pissed off. I went right up to the GF in front of everyone, and said, “What the hell’s going on? Why are you spewing lies about me hitting on you to all my friends?”She just stared at me, unable to respond. I continued, “Just because I’m gay does not mean I’m into you. Trust me, I am not the LEAST bit interested in you.”She started sobbing that I was attacking her for no reason, calling her out, making her super uncomfortable again, etc. I told her to get the hell out, and that she was no longer welcome here for making ME feel uncomfortable in my own apartment. Her and my roommate left.Needless to say, my roommate is super pissed at me. He hasn’t been back to our place since, but I’ve gotten some angry texts. I’m standing my ground that she is not welcome here anymore, but he is free to stay or move out as he pleases.Most of our friends are on my side. I guess I could’ve been easier on her, but I am just so over it.Edit: Wow! I woke up to tons of notifications. Thanks everyone, and thanks for the awards!Edit 2: I guess I should’ve added that where I live, the mask/stay-at-home mandates have been lifted for awhile. That being said, my friends and I still choose to wear masks, and be extremely careful. We do not go out to bars, even though they are fully open. I occasionally have a few close friends over, whom I trust to also be careful. No parties - I don’t get how anyone landed on that. Hope this clears things up."
96,Not the A-hole,"AITA for calling my brother an “insecure, testicle grabbing, chauvinist man-baby” over his comments about my wife’s makeup?",30799,l05log,1724,"That’s the actual quote. I’m still pissed as hell but maybe I went too far here. My brother and I are both late 30s. We get along fine most of the time, but my brother doesn’t do well in a lot of social situations. He says things that are inappropriate, gets overly opinionated, yells a lot etc.  He just doesn’t seem to understand tact or when to let things go in a casual conversation. Our wives are best friends. They talk almost everyday on FaceTime. My wife is an ex model/actress (local) and very good with makeup.  She’s in her mid 30’s, we have 3 kids and she doesn’t wear much makeup anymore - but she got some as a gift for Christmas and decided she wanted to get more. Apparently she’s been buying cheap stuff and she wanted to splurge on some good shit. Anyway, she’s been testing it all out over the last month, buying more here and there and doing these crazy eyeshadow things - honestly I don’t know what I’m talking about. She looks great all the time. She’s gorgeous without makeup. She’s really talented with it though and she’s having a lot of fun. I tease her a little since she works from home and she’s wearing pajamas but her makeup looks like she’s at a nightclub. I think it’s cute and funny. My brother thinks she’s doing it because she’s cheating or she wants to cheat. He called me this morning to say he’s concerned because he’s seen her on FaceTime and he’s decided she must be posting pictures or sending pics to some dude or multiple dudes. I tried to blow it off and explain that it wasn’t that way, but he got more aggressive about it so I ended up yelling at him and shouting the insecure testicle man baby thing. He’s being ridiculous and needs to mind his own business. But I think I might be the asshole for blowing up and name calling when he’s probably well intentioned. I want to add too (my mom and brother both asked, maybe other people will):  No, I haven’t asked my wife why she’s recently starting wearing more makeup and I’m not going to because I think asking is fucking rude. She’s spending her money on stuff for her face and it’s a creative hobby. I’m not going to be the dick that ruins someone’s creative outlet by asking them to justify it or by insinuating there’s a sinister motive behind it. It makes her happy so I assume that’s why she’s doing it. Asking why is dumb and insulting in my opinion."
97,Not the A-hole,AITA for spraying the neighborhood kids with my garden hose?,30785,c5eeb5,2060,"I love strawberries. I love them so much that I planted 300 strawberry plants in my garden. After I harvest, I make lots of strawberry jelly to give to my family, friends, and neighbors. I donate the leftovers to my local food bank.Lately I've had a big problem with all the neighborhood kids coming in my yard and stealing my strawberries. The last time I caught them I threatened them with the police because they was so reckless they smashed over 50 of my plants.I caught them in my yard again this afternoon, instead of calling the police I grabbed my garden hose and sprayed them while chasing them out of my yard. I just had a group of angry parents come to my house complaining about my actions. Absolutely none of them was willing to apologize for their children's actions. One parent in particular is threatening to sue me, because her son's iPhone 10 was ruined with water. I told her that was her problem for letting her eight-year-old son have a $1,000 phone. Then I threatened to spray them with my hose if they didn't get off of my property."
98,Not the A-hole,AITA for having a wedding and not disclosing we were already legally married?,30755,d9m02m,3271,"About two months ago, my husband and I got “married” in a beautiful ceremony. It was SO MUCH FUN. We went on a honeymoon after. The price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it’s their only daughter’s wedding. As a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or I could afford! My husband and I paid the rest — his family did not contribute (which is fine!). The wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. About a year and a half ago, I was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). I had recently graduated from school and didn’t have health insurance. My husband and I decided to get married so I could join his health insurance. It was a quick Justice of the Peace ceremony. We were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. A few months after that, he “proposed” (something I didn’t see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. Very few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. We weren’t trying to be deceptive. However, part of it was that I wasn’t comfortable revealing my health issues. My husband respected this. My parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. His mom (I’ll call her Carol) and I aren’t close. She’s fine enough in low doses, but...We’re currently in the process of moving. This past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. As we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must’ve slipped out. Carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. And then she noticed the date. Carol lost it. She insisted we lied to everyone. She said our wedding ceremony was just a “gift grab” (our wedding website stated that someone’s presence was gift enough— we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). Carol went and called her twin sister, my husband’s aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. She said we were sneaky and deceptive. She is saying she may want her gift back—something we are fine with giving her. For me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so I could get insurance. A means to an end. Our wedding date is what we will celebrate. Are we assholes for not being more upfront? I’ve been really upset and confused and waffle back and forth. My husband insists we are not assholes."

This acc is just for privacy reasons-I always had good grades in high-school, was home on time, cleaned the house etc. I never had problems with my parents before this. -I went to med school, still living with parents when I was 20, I dated someone who was 23-Dad was against this because be does not believe in dating people far older than you (so like don't date far from your own age)  and says I cannot date J. -Argument breaks out, Dad says it's his house so either I agree or I move out. I say it's not fair as J has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. Dad kicks me out. Mom agrees with his decision. Little bro was only 14 at the time. -I moved with J, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (I went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro-Years later, me and J (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (Like really small but I'm happy with it). I ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. I let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  He came a few times. -Today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when I was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. I said never and that I wasn't going to forgive them. Bro says I'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, I say that's bullshit because Dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. Bro says I should at least let Mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. I say Mom was able to do something but didn't,but that Bro's situation was different because he was only 15. Bro is upset because he says Mom and Dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that I am dragging this entire situation. I told him that if he thinks I'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. He's angry and says that I need to move on and that I shouldn't be withholding them from seeing THEIR grandchild. I say that THEY disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist. AITA? I don't hate my bro and I (kinda)  get what he is saying, but I just have a resentment for my parents. It's not like I had a baby just to put it against them,  but my lil bro thinks I'm going go die on a hill with them for something done several years ago and it's petty. I'm curious on what reddit thinks. I want a relationship with my bro, just not my mom and dad"
100,Not the A-hole,AITA for having my daughter write a 'morbid' school family tree project?,30625,jxq6yb,2203,"My biological family is dead. I was raised in foster care, and so my friends are my family. I met my late husband in college. He was just raised by his mother, who had abandoned him and later died (no adoptive family). As an adult, I've looked into both trees and our biological ancestors are, to put it mildly, really dangerous people and/or dead. My late husband and older son died in a car crash.My daughter is in kindergarten and she, more accurately me, was supposed to do a family tree project for school. I tried speaking to her teacher that this was not going to be a Pollyanna report, but she is one of those people that can't comprehend that sometimes family is a dark subject, and insisted that it needed to be biological. So, I did it.Some of them, like her father and my son, I have actual information for aside from that they're dead. But for most of my family and her paternal family, I literally only have birth date, death date, when they would have had their kids, and cemetery information, unless they were cremated.It was supposed to have 10 pictures, but most of the pictures I have of any ancestors are just headstones. I made a trip when my husband and I first married to take pictures of the headstones, so I included those in there. I only have 3 pictures total of my biological family, and most of them are group shots where I could only label maybe 3 people. I don't have any pictures of my late husband's family from before me and my kids, but I put some of the old ones in there too.So while the other kids had long family trees, my daughter was basically introducing the concept of death to her kindergarten class. Now I'm getting slammed with calls from other parents, the teacher, and the principal. They're appalled that I allowed such a ""morbid"" report and are saying I traumatized their children. I don't think I did anything wrong. They wanted a report on her biological ancestors, I gave it, and kept it G-rated. I just didn't lie that people were alive when they weren't. I don't raise her to think that death is taboo or something to be ashamed of anyway. Death is part of life. Most of her/my family is dead, so talking about family just means talking about death, and it's just something you have to accept. AITA?"
101,Not the A-hole,"AITA for refusing to use the money I inherited from my mother to pay for medical treatment for my half-sister, who has a life threatening sickness? She is the child of my father and the woman he cheated on my mother with.",30591,cz5vk2,7944,"When I was 25, we found out that my father had been cheating on my mother for years and he had a 7 year old daughter with his mistress. In one split second, the happy family I knew was gone, and I went through the darkest time in my life.My parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). She never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship I wanted to have with him. I eventually forgave my dad mostly because I was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. I talk to him but I want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister.My mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which I now own and operate. I am in a relatively comfortable financial position, while my dad is... getting by. He was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up.This year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. The bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment.The thing is, I don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. Though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when I think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and I have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. I'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. They are her parents after all. The only thing tying me to her is my father saying ""She is your sister"" and ""If she dies because she didn't get the treatment she needs, would you be able to sleep at night?""AITA?"
102,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling my grandma by wrong name until she gets my name right?,30477,jlzj6u,2953,"This has going on since forever so decided to do something. I’m (16m) half Mexican from my dad’s side and my mom’s side is Scottish. Ngl most of my mom’s family is high key racist and is been problems sometimes growing up. My grandma on my mom’s side never liked my dad and was happy after they divorced when I was 7.My names Emiliano and my grandma always complained how hard she tried to change my parents minds and it’s a shame I got stuck with it. I’m actually proud of it. My dad told me about the revolutionary I was named after and their history.But literally my entire life my grandma refuses to say it. She says it’s “too many syllables” (i got a cousin named Alexandria and they say the whole name) and always came up with her own names. She says Leo or once tried to get everyone to call me “Elliot” as a nickname for a while. Obvious my moms family was for it but my dad refused that cause it’s not my name. Is always the same thing when I see them. She’ll call me Leo or whatever. Even when I correct her she says it’s not a big deal an keeps calling wrong name. I told my mom I don’t like it but she always say I’m just not gonna change her mind and no point in fighting it.So I decided if she not gonna wanna call me by my actual name in not gonna call her grandma or say her right name. Is stupid I know but it’s bothering me more that she don’t care and all my other cousins she says their names fine, no nicknames. Her name is Susan so I decided to call her Sandy.  Tbh I was scared to say it but that look on her face was worth it lmao. It wasn’t surprise Pikachu face but it was close. She said that is not how I address her and it’s “grandma”. I told her nah I’mma call her sandy from now until she says my actual name.It got awkward. My mom was serious and my gma got super red in the face. She started ranting about me being a fucking disrespectful child and this is all my dad influencing me again. My mom told me I need to apologize immediately but idk what gave me the balls to not do it. We ended up leaving there house early and my mom didn’t talk to me until we got home. She say what I did was outta line and I don’t disrespect my elders ever. She wants me to apologize and I’m grounded until I do. Haven’t talked to my dad yet about this since it just happened but I wanted to ask if it was being an asshole or was it okay for this situation to “insult my grandmother” ?"
103,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to visit my dad after my room was converted to an office/bedroom?,30411,e52dls,3307,"I used to visit my dad most weekends and all of summer.He recently got remarried to someone I actually have a decent relationship with. I also have two stepbrothers who are younger and who I don't really interact with.My dad has a four bedroom house. So all the kids have a bedroom.When I went to visit last month, I was ""surprised"" with a renovated room. And by renovated I mean it was converted to an office with a couch that pulls out to a bed. It did look nice I suppose.Apparently my stepmother works from home and needed an office.I didn't cry or throw a tantrum. I slept in the room that weekend and have refused to stay the night since.I was really hurt and felt like I didn't matter. My mom tried to convince me to go back but gave up after I told her I was old enough to decide.My dad is stressing out and has apologized and said he'll change the room back but honestly, I'm done. This was the final thing that sealed the deal for me. I told him that as well. I told him I'll come for day visits and we can have dinners but I won't be staying overnight anymore.Was I the asshole? He did cry and I feel really shitty about it.Edit: I'm going to be 15 in a few months"
104,Not the A-hole,AITA for correcting my daughter’s teacher about her name?,30381,go5wwj,4064,"My 7 year old daughter’s doing virtual school in our living room recently. I heard her teacher address a girl named Kelly a few times, which stuck out to me because my daughter’s class is only about 15 kids and I know them all by this point in the year. A couple times more and I realized she was calling my daughter Kelly. My daughter’s name is Keeley, pronounced Kee-Lee. So after school was over I asked her if that had been happening all year in this teacher’s class and she said it had and it really annoyed her. I asked her why she hadn’t corrected the teacher if it annoyed her so much and she said she had repeatedly at the beginning of the year but the teacher kept calling her Kelly, so eventually she gave up on reminding her. I sent the teacher a quick email explaining the misunderstanding but got no response. This teacher teaches a special subject (think music, gym, art, or language), not just one grade level, so my daughter will be in her classes for the next several years, so we couldn’t just wait it out. And how moments like these are handled now will set the stage for how my kid deals with similar situations on her own in the working world. I encouraged my daughter to come to class early or stay late her again, thinking maybe she hadn’t heard or understood her last time, so a quiet one on one would be better.She got to the class early and she told her very politely that her name was “Keeley like really, instead of Kelly like jelly” and that people often get it confused so she just wanted to clarify.So class starts and sure enough she gets called Kelly again almost immediately. So there’s only so much self advocation a seven year old can be expected to do. I just walked over and said “Hi, this is *Keeley’s* Dad. Her’s name not Kelly. It’s Keeley. Hard E. Sorry for any confusion.” A few hours later I had an email in my inbox “inviting” my wife and I to a parent teacher conference with the vice principle. The long and short of the meeting ended up being the school feels that while the teacher probably should’ve learned her name, that the real problem is she feels I challenged her authority by correcting her in class and that the names were “similar enough” for it to “not have warranted such drastic action.”That surprised me. I couldn’t believe a meeting was necessary, let alone that it cast blame on us. I can’t tell if I’m being that annoying “my kid matters most” parent that my grandmother the schoolteacher always complained about or if the teacher should just learn her damn name because that’s a basic part of her job. AITA?"
105,Not the A-hole,AITA for medically tattooing my child under the recommendation of a doctor.,30340,k70qfu,2725,"Hear me out. I (31F) and my husband tried for 5 years to get pregnant. Testing eventually revealed I have eggs of fucking steel and without medical help I'll never get pregnant. So that's what we did. Gave our samples, one petri dish and 9 months later I have 2 beautiful fraternal twin boys. Jack and Adam (fake).Thing is Jake has a condition. Without going into detail, requires a shot once a week. Once he is older he can take pills. I went back to work and MIL offered to watch the babes (shes wonderful, I trust her 100%. They were 9months.. Now 16months) during this time she would give his injection as we had a schedule. 10am before snack and nap. Worked very well until a month ago when she gave the shot to the wrong kid. Now they may be fraternal but they look identical. I'll be honest my husband and I even mix them up sometimes. Everyone does. She immediately noticed her mistake called 911 and they were transferred to hospital. By the time I got there Adam had been given the reversal agent and they were both happily sipping on juice loving the attention. We went home the same night told to push fluids. He was never in danger. Its a very slow acting medication that, at worst, would have given him diarrhea in a few days. MIL was beside herself. I tried to ease her worry but she refused to babysit so to daycare they went. This daycare has a nurse cause some of the kids have medications so she new what to do but the worry of mixing up the kids was a valid concern (and they would NOT keep name tags on) Doctor recommended a medical tattoo. Explained they tattoo a freckle, no bigger then the end of a pencil eraser, on an area of skin that's easily seen while the child is under mild sedation similar to dental offices. Because of the area it usually fades in 2-3yrs but by then they should have developed more personal features and may not need it redone. So after discussion with my husband we did it. He has a 2mm brown freckle on his earlobe.  From entering the office to leaving it took 30 minutes. Never felt a thing.MIL lost her shit the second I mentioned a medical tattoo. I tried to explain but she just freaked out so I put both kids on the floor and told her to pick up Jack and find the tattoo. She picked up Adam So I handed her Jack and after 20 minutes still couldn't find it. Stripped him to his skivvies. I finally pointed it out and she went ""That's just a freckle""  I just said... ""My point exactly. Adam doesn't have a freckle there.. So that's how daycare can tell them apart""She's still pissed and ranting. Once I explain to others and they fail to find it they understand but they still think I went to far in tattooing my child and altering their body. I believe I took the necessary precautions recommended by the doctor and the tattoo will fade with sun exposure and as he grows. By the time he's 5 it probably won't even be visible or it'll just look like a faded freckle. So.. AITA?"
106,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I send my parents to jail?,30321,ic651e,2286,"My (29f) parents have always been in financial trouble, something that I have never been able to understand because they both have a really generous salary (more than three times my own). Because of these financial troubles, my auns, uncles, and grandma have had over the years to lend them money, we were evicted a couple of times (that I know), we have had the water, the electricity and the internet cut... Many things that over the years I admit have affected my emotional and mental health.All of this has made my relationship with my parents very difficult over the years, more when they would take advantage of me making me pay for many things with the money that I earned working during holidays to pay for college or making me call my grandma to ask her for money, all of it while my mum used to spend money whenever she could in purses or jewellery .In the moment I became an adult because they started to sign on the bills under my name without my permission mostly because their credit was so bad that the companies wouldn't allow them to sign with their own names. When I figured it out I asked them to stop but they just lied about it and I just let it go because I couldn't deal with it.Fast forward to the present, because of the 'rona situation, I was looking forward the money from my income tax return, because my salary has gone down so this money would have helped a lot. Instead of it, I received a letter from a courthouse saying that the money has been confiscated. I immediately phoned my mum and she said that she didn't know anything about it but she will fix it. Since I don't trust her at all I called the court myself and then they explained me that during the last year there has been a proccess against me by a company I owe money from unpaid bills. All the papers had been sent to my parents and they had sign and take them. The debt was not paid with the money from the tax income so part of my salary from now on will be confiscated too until is fully paid.So my parents stole my identity to contract a bill under my name, didn't pay for it and when the company claim that debt through lawyers and a judge they kept all the papers from me (which is also illegal) apparently waiting for all of it to be fixed by itself.My mother said that it was her right to put it under my name because I am her daughter and it is my duty to help with the family burdens. Since then, and after really nasty words from her side and my sister's (who says that I am ungrateful and selfish) I haven't spoken to them and I am in the middle of a global pandemic with my salary already low, paying for a debt that it is not mine.My friends and boyfriend say that I should talk with the police and stop all of this because otherwise they will keep doing it and I am afraid they will.So, WIBTA if I speak with the court even if it means that my parents (70 and 63) could go to jail?Edit: Answers to some questions [here]("
107,Not the A-hole,"AITA for expecting my boyfriend to replace all my socks, the exact same ones as I had before?",30296,kn4yux,4687,"This might seem silly. I (24F) like wearing cheerful socks, since my uniform is all white (currently working as an phlebotomist), it usually cheers up the patients too. I've spent a few years collecting strange socks, ones with sushi, pizza, corgis, cats, Nick Cage, etc. I think I had about 30 pairs. My boyfriend (29M) has always hated them, and thinks they're childish. So I agreed to only wear them to work, and never on dates or around his friends/family. I thought that was fair. On boxing day his parents came over for coffee and gifts (just the 4 of us, which is allowed where I live, and keeping a solid 3 meters apart). I accidentally put on a pair of 'childish' socks, and his mother made a comment about it. I explained that I wear them to work to cheer people up, and she liked that. My boyfriend didn't. The next day all my socks were gone, and the drawer was filled with plain black socks. I asked my boyfriend, and he told me he threw them away and purchased some more 'appropriate' socks, so I won't embarrass him in front of his parents again. I told him that that's insane, they were mine and he had no right to throw them away. Not to mention that I spend quite some time collecting them. So I made a list of the ones I remembered I had, and told him that I expect the same ones as a replacement. He told me that's completely unreasonable, and that it would take a lot of time/effort/money for him to find those specific pairs. I haven't changed my mind yet, they cost me a lot of time and effort to find too. I think he's being controlling, he thinks I'm being unreasonable and demanding. AITA?I think I might be an asshole for asking for the exact same pairs, I know that'll take a lot of effort to find.Edit: Thanks everyone for replying, I've realised that this might not be a 'normal' fight and am evaluating the relationship."
108,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I started calling my white coworkers by random 'white' names?,30171,c03hb1,5462,"I moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.'So the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, ""How do you pronounce that?"" It's Tina!I have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, ""Just for the record, my name is Tina!"" to lighthearted, ""Tina, like Tina Belcher!"" In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, ""Thanks Tiana!"" Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like:Chuck: Thanks, TianaTina: No problem, Chad!Jessica: Hi Tiara!Tina: Good morning, Jennifer!Would I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it.EDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things:A lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense!A lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.A lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!And finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over.EDIT #2:No, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or ""Tiara""No, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.No, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code!Yes, I correct them every time.No, it's not because I'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!Responding to this post saying, 'Okay Shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('Tiana' being the 'Shaniqua' in this instance). Several people have alarmingly said, 'Okay, Trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'Chad' is VERY WEIRD!"
109,Not the A-hole,AITA for laughing in my brother and SIL’s faces when they demanded to use my credit card?,30143,j7b7ew,2636,"So I am 22F. I don’t have much knowledge about finances and stuff as I still live at home as I’m at university. I do however pay my parents about £300 a month rent, I pay my own phone plan, buy material stuff I want or need, pay out for other services like for music or whatever and try to put as much as I can in savings whilst still keeping enough in my main account for day to day purchases. Currently, I am saving up for driving lessons and hope that if I pass decently, I can use some of my savings towards getting a car. I’m in my final year of uni so I’ll be done and able to work full time when all this happens. I also decided to get a credit card so I can learn how to manage credit wisely and build some up. My credit score is good for someone of my age and circumstance but obviously it’s nothing great in comparison for other stuff. I should point out that at most I only plan on using this card with a total adding up to £100. Ive stuck to that so far and only actually used it twice with these purchases only adding up to £80 and I paid it off quickly. I do not plan on exceeding my limit any time soon as I’ve heard far too many horror stories of people just using their credit card too much cos it was handy and getting into debt.The only people I disclosed this to was my dad as my mum has the tendency to blab to my brother and SIL (both 28.) She happened to overhear us talking one day and before I knew it, my brother and SIL got wind and asked me if they could use it. They both admitted they had debt spurned on by excessive credit card use and thought that since I basically had nothing owed on mine, it was “free money.” I told them quite politely that I was really uncomfortable with that idea and that I would owe the money and I can’t Magic up that kind of money. Things went quiet until a few days later they both turned up at the house. They were nice to start with but basically started demanding I let them use the card and they tried to manipulate by mother into guilting me into doing it. I got really angry and when my brother said I owe it to them because they used to babysit me up until a couple of years ago, I laughed in their faces and walked out.When I came home, I learnt they tried to manipulate my dad and he kicked them both out. My mother then tried and he told her to go too and she is currently staying with my brother and SIL. The only person on my side is my dad who tells me they’re all trying to take me for a ride and they’re trying to manipulate me cos I’m young and they think I’m vulnerable. My brother, SIL and mum on the other hand think it isn’t a big deal letting someone else use my card. It’s really messing with my head and I just want everyone to stop being in an argument. AITA?"
110,Not the A-hole,AITA for not sharing medical history before being pranked?,30125,gflupe,2055,"Heyo,I'm a schizophrenic.  Started when I was 22, and will last till I die. I'm active in schizophrenic communities, go to groups,  the works but I am fairly private about it to most people to include friends. It's fairly common for people to think I'm eccentric (comes with the turf) due to some of my habits. Those habits include not going to parties or other places with lots of people, suddenly deciding not to do something (I have to be protective not to do or go to certain things if I think a delusion might be coming on), saying the occasional odd quip, normal schizophrenic stuff.Some friends thought it would be funny to make it seem like  I might be going crazy as a group. They would individually wear something silly like a wizard hat or dinosaur costume (TRex blow up costume) to a group event or say something totally out of the ordinary and pretend like it was normal (Police like to track people like you, covid is just a way to microchip you, etc). These are very real scary thoughts to me. I would ask members of the group if they had heard concerns about these conspiracies or weird garb from the other members, but they all acted like they had hung out with that particular member that day and I hadn't been involved.I was really, really scared that this could have been a massive delusion morphing into a full psychosis so I preemptively checked myself into a hospital to stop myself from potentially hurting myself or diving further into the rabbit hole(common in schizophrenic community). I was so scared my medications stopped working. No one heard from me for a few days while I was in the hospital, and when I checked out I confided in one of them about what had happened. I got a really long apology explaining what had happened and I blew up at them. I have ignored attempts from the others trying to apologize and have no desire to talk with them again.AITA for not previously stating that I am schizophrenic?Edit- People have been asking saying to post the length of the prank. Around 3 weeks.Edit 2- Thank you for the awards and stuff, but I really want to highlight some of the messages I have gotten. I'm at around 150 messages and counting and am trying to respond to the ones where I can hopefully offer insight.Resources that I find helpful- r/schizophrenia For groups just google schizophrenia support groups in my area, something will pop up and when you actually get there someone will have a further list. You get what you put into groups. You don't have to talk your first couple of times. But no one will look at you with the batshit look if you say ""Reality check- is there a bird in the room or something in that regard"". That did happen once and the audible sigh of relief from 8 other people and the laughter that followed was hysterical. Medication helps so much. It's the difference between being able to go for a walk with my dog and staying in bed all day. But it takes time. So many people have asked what drug and dosage a loved on should go on. I cannot answer that. There are so many drugs out there and different dosages. I can tell you that you (probably) will not have a noticable difference in behavior in two weeks after trying a medication. You start small, and work your way up to a therapeutic effect (when it actually helps). It might take some time to actually get to feeling human again. Not every medication is meant for every person, but don't give up!"
111,Not the A-hole,"AITA for ""tricking"" my copycat sister to cut her hair?",29948,hwcqu8,2232,"I have a younger sister who looks exactly like me. I am 19 and she is 16, but people have been mistakening us as twins for some time because of how close we resemble each other. We have same height, same skin tone, similar voice even. She also has a habit of being a copycat, from way of dressing to hobbies, even piercings. I know, its cute if you look it from the outside, sisters dressing and looking so alike that they are spitting images of each other.Honestly though, it's annoying and creeps me out sometimes, like yeah, we are quite close too but why does she always happen to pick up everything I pick up??I have been asking her to stop that, but she always insist that she really just finds it suiting her liking that she just had to try it herself by getting similar, if not identical things that I have.One afternoon I was tidying up some costumes in my college showroom and found a rather cute brown and pink wig, looks like mushroom. I put it on, think it looks rather funny so I snapped a picture of it and posted in my Instagram. I received a text from my sister asking if I really cut my hair(I did not mention it was a wig). The AH part is - while I somewhat have a feeling that she MIGHT copy that too, I lied and replied yes, I want a change of style.I went home when weekends came and lo and behold - my sister emerged with the same silly brown and pink bob cut, except this one is her permanent hair. She was very surprised that I arrived with my hair still long, then realized that I lied to her. She was furious that she had to cut that silly hairstyle because she thought I had it, but truth be told, I never asked her to. She should have seen it in my picture that that hairstyle look super silly and yet she still tried to cut her hair that way.Our parents think that it was a really bad joke and wanted me to cut my hair too to make it up to her(I wonder why did they not stop her in the first place). While I feel sorry for her, I am somewhat glad that at least she won't be able to copy my hairstyle now with her hair so short so I am keeping my hair long."

I don't know how he has such a high turnover rate but I'm guessing it's to do with him being both rich and a raging narcissist. He invited me to get coffee and introduced me to his new fiancee. I knew he was going to do this because two of my brothers (there are 7 of us total, none have the same mother) said that they had just gotten coffee with dad and met the fiancee, then been invited to the wedding, and both had been given a plus one for their girlfriends of 8 and 10 months respectively.Dad told me to bring my ""partner"" when I came for coffee and I brought my (trans) boyfriend along. We have been together for 3 years. The fiancee seemed nice, wanting to know about me and my boyfriend and asking questions that sounded like she actually gave a shit. Dad gets all the details of the engagement/wedding out of the way and then asks me, and only me, if I'll be there.I notice that he was talking to just me, not my boyfriend, so I say ""*we* will check if *we're* free"".Dad replies that ""this is family only""I reply, ""I just assumed, seeing as how the other siblings got plus ones""Dad says ""that's different. Are you coming?""I say ""we'll catch the next one"".Dad's fiancee becomes visibly upset and they leave. Dad texts me after that if I can be civil on the day then I can still come alone.I felt like I had to stick up for my boyfriend because this was definitely due to him being transgender, and he thanked me at the time but told me that I should probably still go, but after reporting back to my siblings to say what had happened I got mixed responses. The overall opinion was that while I absolutely should stick up for my boyfriend this was some hill to die on and I managed to catch the actually nice fiancee in the crossfire and upset dad, too.AITA?Info: I am a woman. My boyfriend is trans FTM. Despite both of us being straight, dad thinks of us as lesbians due to my boyfriend's biology. Of me and my siblings, 3 were within wedlock and the other 4 (including me) were extramarital: 3 affairs, 1 long term girlfriend. The fiancee knows she's #5 and dad gives the same story about how he was tricked into marrying golddiggers by accident and didn't know until too late and the affairs all happened as the relationships were breaking down."
113,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling a woman who lives in my complex that yes having her husband check me out turns me on?,29776,fvx43x,1573,"Okay, hear me out. I live in a complex that is built in a circle so its like a track. A lot of people use it to run, walk, etc. I've always used it to run/walk as well. I live in Florida so I usually wear leggings and a sports bra or a tank top. I literally only wear it because it's insanely hot here.This woman always gave me dirty looks when I'd walk by her apartment (she'd be sitting on her porch.) There are a few maintenance guys (not sure if that is the correct title for them - but that is what everyone calls them) that walk and ride around on golf carts throughout the day. I soon realized that the dirty look woman is married to one of the maintenance workers. I am always polite to them, but have never talked to them by any means.So, yesterday I was working out on the tennis court which is near their apartment. Her and her husband were sitting on the porch. She is giving me the dirtiest looks and is making me pretty uncomfortable but I try to ignore it. Before I leave she says, ""Do you like get off on having the maintenance men check you out all day?"" To which I replied, ""Actually yes it makes me super wet. They are what keeps my sex drive high."" She looked shocked and her husband started laughing and then she smacked him on the arm. I came back and told my mom this story and she said I should be more sensitive and obviously the woman is insecure. Now I kinda feel bad. AITA?"

It was a cheap but not great house, but I signed because I wanted the backyard space. Over the past few years I erected a small garden shed, greenhouse and pizza oven (transportables), planted lots of veggie gardens in big transportable garden beds, and put down some nice pavers, an aquaponics set up, and generally made the backyard a really green and beautiful place to be. It became the green oasis all my friends gathered at. A few months ago, my landlords let me know they were planning to sell, and my final move out day was a week ago. When I left, I brought my garden with me to my new place - nothing in my last backyard was directly planed into the ground, and nothing permanent. I dismantled the sheds and greenhouse, loaded up all the pots and garden beds onto a truck and cleared the backyard in three days with lots of help. My former landlords are furious over this, and demand that I return the backyard to the former state - apparently they’d listed the house for sale with pictures of the backyard and potential buyers were walking away from the house when they saw the barren backyard. They’re accusing me of stealing their plants, and wrecking the backyard.Legally I’m fine - my contract said I could garden, and I have photos from the first real estate walkthrough before I moved in that show that the backyard was in the same state as I first found it (although with more fertile soil now probably). The same real estate agent signed off my final inspection, and I got my deposit back. I’ve received mixed responses though, because I saw the landlords taking pictures of my backyard before I left but didn’t make the connection because imho when pictures of a house has furniture in it, you don’t expect to also get free furniture. Some of my coworkers suggested that IATA because the house valuation certainly has fallen dramatically because I didn’t tell them I was taking my garden with me, so they couldn’t plan to landscape before lockdown hit.Tldr AITA for moving my garden that I build from my former rental house into my new house, upsetting my former landlords who didn’t expect me to take it with me?"
115,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling relatives how much I make and defending my salary?,29712,i0oqvb,2546,"Over the weekend, I (23F) went to dinner with some of my dad’s relatives who I don’t see very often. My dad has never gotten along with my uncle (his brother) and I haven’t either. He’s rude, condescending, and we don’t agree with him on a lot of things. Normally I just try to ignore him. However, at dinner, my uncle asked me about my car I had shown up in and my new job. I started my job a little over a year ago after graduating college and I worked hard for it. I make a lot of money and I’m proud of that. (Software engineer.) I recently bought myself my dream car I’ve always wanted. Uncle asked “How much are they paying you anyway?” in a condescending tone, and I just point blank told him how much I make. I guess I was supposed to laugh and say something like “Oh, enough” but I told him the number. He started going off on a rant about how no 23-year-old should make that much money and how stupid my company is for paying me that much. I got pissed and said “I deserve every penny I make. I work hard and most people can’t do what I do.” Well, I guess this really made my uncle angry, because after dinner I received a text from my cousin saying I had been really rude at dinner and insulted my uncle’s intelligence. My dad sided with me (since he hates my uncle anyway) but my sister agreed with my cousin and said I shouldn’t have said how much money I make or talked to my uncle the way I did because it was impolite. AITA?EDIT: Wow, I didn’t expect for this to blow up! Thanks for the responses everyone. I feel justified in how I reacted now. For more info on my uncle - he’s a retired airline pilot, so I don’t think he’s even jealous/bitter about how much I make, he’s just a jerk."
116,Not the A-hole,"AITA for refusing to accept my parents ""gift"" and then walking out.",29701,ccnvdo,4761,"throwaway as my dad uses reddit. so I'm close to graduating high school and have been applying to universities and looking at some by doing the tours and stuff. my parents decided to give me a gift for when I graduate, its 10,000$ toward my uni costs. I remember screaming and hugging my parents and thanking them. that was untill I found out the terms and conditions, I can only go to 2 universities (they are the ones closest to my parents) and they gave me a selection of courses I can pick from, surprisingly art degree is not one of them. so I told my parents that I cant accept the gift as I dont want to abide by some terms and conditions,I also told them it was kinda shitty to pay me to do what they want me to do. i explained that i now feel bad for being super excited because i definitely cant accept my gift now knowing what the rules are.  this caused a massive fight where I was called ungrateful and that I'm not a nice daughter. so I walked out of the house and have been staying with a friend until this cools off. reflecting back I do think that I might be the asshole but I'm unsure so I've come to you. I will accept any judgment"
117,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking out my girlfriend because she said my relationship with my brother was disgusting.,29701,cx82jo,3268,"I’m(22M) a legal guardian of my 15 year old brother. We’re very close and we have always been like that. He lives with me now obviously. He often gets really sad, we recently lost our parents, so I comfort him as best as I can. So, about my girlfriend, we have been together for 2 years. She doesn’t live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys.2 days ago, she came over without warning me. Me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn’t wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me. She woke us up and made a scene in front of him. She said that our relationship was weird and disgusting and it’s extremely concerning that he’s so affectionate towards me. My brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. I brought him to his room and calmed him down. I went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. I told her to get the fuck out. She got defensive again and said that she was just stating her opinion without hurting anyone. I grabbed her wrist and brought her to door. I didn’t hurt her, she was following me, I didn’t use any force. She left, she called me few times but I didn’t answer.Update: thanks for all the comments. I talked to her, she still said that she didn’t do anything wrong,she didn’t hurt my brother and it wasn’t her fault that he started crying. I broke up with her. Also little info: this doesn’t happen often, we were on couch, watching tv and fell asleep. He laid on top of me after he fell asleep, he moves around a lot while sleeping."
118,Not the A-hole,AITA for not giving my brother and his wife any privacy?,29695,i1r9ka,3130,"My brother lost his job along with all his savings several months ago, and soon after he asked me if it would be okay if he (28M) and his wife (30F) stayed with me until they could afford their own place again. I hesitated at first, considering I only have a 1 bedroom apartment, but according to them they had 'no other options' so of course I invited them over and bought a blow-up mattress for the living room.For the first month things were manageable, although admittedly cramped. Then my brother told me that sleeping on the mattress was giving him back pains, so he asked if he could buy a small double bed for the living room. The living room is by far the biggest room I have, so I told him that would be fine as long as there was still room for my couch/TV/bookshelves.  The living room is also connected to my kitchen in an open plan style, so I reminded my brother to leave walking space around the bed.It's now been 2+ months and things have gotten a lot worse. When they first moved in, I would still use the living room every day to unwind on the couch after work. Now whenever I go in, there's a strange vibe like I'm intruding. My brother and his wife are often sitting in bed together when I go in (I always knock) and stare at me pointedly until I leave. Sometimes when I sit down they will directly ask me for some 'alone time' and say they would like the room to themselves.This came to a head yesterday when my sister-in-law messaged me with a 'timetable' she'd made of when it would be 'a good time' for me to use the living room. The timetable basically says that they will allow me into the room for an hour each evening, plus 20 minutes around mealtimes.I basically shut her down instantly and told her there was no WAY I'd be following the timetable since in the end it's my apartment. She sent me back a HUGE message with a dozen paragraphs about how my constant presence was 'ruining' her marriage with my brother and they feel like they have no privacy. I tried to talk this over with my brother that night, but when I got home neither my brother/SIL were talking to me, so he's clearly just as pissed. Today an Amazon parcel arrived for my brother with a lock for the living room door, which I told him there's 'absolutely no way' I will allow him to install. My brother says I'm 'creepy' for wanting constant access to where they sleep and he's insisting on installing the lock anyway.AITA for not giving my brother and his wife their privacy?"
119,Not the A-hole,"AITA: I, a female, want to give my fiance my last name, but my father and brother don't want me to. Am I wrong for planning on doing it anyways?",29624,eh8f8j,3475,"To start, my fiance is willing and happy to take my last name-- he grew up with a horrible father. He has no attachment to his last name and no siblings. I have a very unique last name and a strong attachment to it. I brought this up to my father and he said wasn't so sure about it, given my brother is the only male in the family who would carry on the name. My brother found out before I could bring it up to him and called me, saying I was being inconsiderate and couldn't believe he hadn't been asked. This got me irritated, because in my opinion, I have just a right to share my name as he did with his wife. He and his wife have been married for over a year and I think they feel possessive about the fact they were the only ones ""supposed"" to carry on our name.I think the fact that this is an issue at all is rather sexist. It's my last name too and if I want to give my future husband--who has never had the privilege of feeling like he belongs to a family-- my name, no one should take issue. I have three sisters who aren't yet married, but they shouldn't have to feel bad about giving their name either. I don't feel like I'm being selfish here, but AITA for breaking tradition?*UPDATE* Did not expect this to blow up! My father and brother are amazing people and husbands—I think they were caught off guard by my thinking more than anything else. I’ve let it go for now, but will bring it up again simply to explain my thinking and I believe they will understand. They are rational, empathetic human beings, if a little old school sometimes :) As for my fiancé— he is absolutely amazing and all my family approves . When I originally brought up keeping my last name, he was the one who suggested taking mine as well. He’s perfectly secure in his masculinity for all those wondering lmao.Thank you for all the encouragement! My fiancé and I will be rocking our kickass last name soon enough."
120,Not the A-hole,AITA For Not Forgiving My Husband (26m) For A Mistake And Not Trusting Him With Our Child?,29535,itg9l6,4012,"Throwaway accountI (24f) gave birth to my daughter six months ago and it should've been the happiest moment in my life. When my daughter was born her skin was very dark and looked like she could have two biological parents who were of African descendent. My husband Jim (26m), fake name, was furious and accused me of cheating and left right then and there. He told everyone on both sides of the family what happened, made posts on social media and wanted a divorce. His family and a lot of our friend all called to say how upset they were at me and called me really nasty names. My mother was by my side the entire time and I kept professing my innocence. Jim refused to pick me up from the hospital, threw my stuff out on the lawn and changed the locks, so I had to stay with my parents. When my sister called to ask for the baby stuff Jim texted me pictures of the bare nursery room and said he got rid of everything. He even destroyed my Art studio, I like to paint, and the art I made and told me my work would be too awful to sell. I was distraught and tried to focus on my baby.Weeks went by and Jim refused to speak to me directly and has never once asked about our child. Eventually he agreed to do a paternity and he was 100% the father. No one could believe the results and it was done again, Jim's the dad. Around that same time one of Jim's cousins did the Ancestry thing and there was around 30% of African ancestry in the family. This combined with the test Jim paternal great-grandmother admitted to having an affair around the time Jim's grandfather was born and was because he could pass she just assumed her husband was the father.Since then Jim has been reaching out and everyone has come to apologize, and while it did feel good to feel vindicated the damage has been done. I can't un-hear or unsee all the horrible things that was said and done. Not just to me but to my child as well. Jim made some very racist remarks. Things that I thought he'd never say and he did it so easily. Regardless of what our daughter looks like I don't want her to be around that. What else will Jim and his family say or do the next time they get mad? How are they going to treat our daughter when she does something that upsets them?Jim has been begging for forgiveness. I said I needed time, he asked to see the baby and I let him but I'm too afraid to physically hand her to him. He's repairing the the nursery and keeps asking me what I would like and I cry every time saying we already had what I liked and some of the items that we had can't be replaced. He asked me if I still loved him and I admitted that he showed me his worst self and I don't know if I could live with that image. I didn't mean to be hurtful but it's how I feel. My sister suggested Couple's Therapy but I don't feel like I should have to work to fix something that I didn't break. I've never cheated and have been 100% innocent in all of this the whole. AITA for not wanting to give Jim a second chance?Update 1: I stepped away for a few hours and couldn't believe what I came back to. I am truly amazed by all the wonderful comments of support as well as the private messages. I also understand why some people may think this is fake and all I can say is that you are free to believe what you want in this. I also see some questions and I think I should clarify a few things just in case your judgement may change.1. All of this initially happened at the near February and I was already settled at my parents' house before the pandemic hit.2. One of the reasons Jim wouldn't pick me up from the hospital was because I wouldn't admit to cheating or give him any details, because there weren't any which made him angrier.3. Based on the pictures Jim sent me he didn't take a sledgehammer to the crib or anything. He just took stuff down to either return it for the money or gave it away. While deeply hurtful I wouldn't call it violent, but maybe it is.4. Online he announced that I ""pushed out a dark skinned baby"" and was going to he was divorce me. His family started with the racial comments and eventually he started doing it too but only through my family, he refused to speak to me directly.5. Once the truth came out everything he and his family posts were all taken down but I, and a few friends, still have the screenshots. Jim never wrote down his racial remarks.6. While he didn't say any of the racist words he did make comments about our daughter being a ""Welfare Princess,"" and how I was going to be just another ""baby mama.""7. Just to clarify. Jim is ""white"" and I am at least half white. One of my parents is adopted and with everything that's happened they decided to do the Ancestry thing too and we should be getting the results any day now.Update 2: Spelling Errors  Update 3:   Mod denied separate post so it's here as an edit.Thank you so for all your words of encouragement a couple months back, both in posts and the DMs. A lot of things have happened since my initial post and I just needed time to process it and be in a place where I can write about on social media. So here it goes....First, my parent who was adopted did the Ancestry/23 thing and it turns out that Jim wasn't the only one who had African ancestry. My parent had at least 45%, which means I have at least 20%. I am legally separated from my husband with primary custody, and I'm living with my parents until further notice. He still keeps apologizing and wants me to come back to the house, he even offered to leave so I could stay with our daughter but I don't want to and really like having the support of my parents. My dad is retired so he does a lot of the babysitting while my mother and I work remotely.I do go to the house every so often so Jim can see his daughter and for Couple's Counseling via telecom. In one of the sessions Jim confessed something really hurtful and some of you guessed right, he cheated. It was while we were dating, before he proposed, and his treatment towards me was a projection. It was with an ex-girlfriend who had cheated on him and he hooked up with her as an ego boost. He started to feel guilty but was too scared that I would walk away to ever confess. Jim also admitted that he was scared when I got pregnant (our baby wasn't planned), was very anxious about being a father, but just pretended to be excited because he didn't want to look like an A. My husband was so willing to believe that our daughter wasn't his because he thought he had an out. Now that he knows that our child is his and has spent time with her Jim regrets everything and just wants his family back and is willing to spend the rest of his life making it up to us.This was all deeply hurtful and I've cried about it more than once. Jim has been lying to me and my ability to trust him hasn't improved at all. When the holidays came around Jim's parents asked about seeing their grandchild and I didn't want to. They told me that it was selfish of me to keep her away and I reminded them of their past. They said that they've already apologized and tried to minimize the situation. They said that I can't be angry forever and that I need to learn to forgive them. I'm so ashamed of ever loving and marrying into this family and wonder why I didn't see this before. I've decided to contact a lawyer and will be filing for divorce after my daughter's first Birthday."
121,Not the A-hole,"AITA for ""mansplaining"" vaginas to a woman?",29526,gwxbxu,2318,"This happened a few months ago, but my brain won't let this one go.So I was hanging out with some friends. Two guys, one woman. We're all in our early 20s and have had our fair share of romance in life. The topic of sex popped up and we start talking about some of our past experiences. One guy joked about how having sex only made his dick bigger and bigger. We all laughed and he said that he wished that's how it works. My female friend (let's call her Sarah) piped up and said ""Yeah, for women, it's the complete opposite. The more sex you have, the bigger your labia gets and the looser you become."" There were some chuckles, but then I asked her if she was serious. She said she was.Now, this is a big myth. I was surprised a woman who has had some experience actually believes that. I basically told her this, and then she started getting annoyed, asking ""how me and my dick knows about that"". I said the same way I know anything about female anatomy- I've read up on it. The whole ""women get looser"" thing is something sexist dudes made up to slut-shame women. My other friends were silent on this. She then just said: ""Whatever, I'm not in the mood for your mansplaining.""So I'm at a loss here. AITA for explaining something that I feel like people should just know about?"
122,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling my parents how to read my diary?,29462,hjwxmn,2294,"I am 15f and I have diary, and to prevent my older sister from reading it I created a new alphabet and to make it even harder to decode its not just the Latin alphabet that looks differently, i made some sounds like Yu, Ya, Sh, etc as one letter, like they are in Cyrillic. (Alphabet Russian, Bulgarian, Kazakh etc use)Well my parents were snooping in my room and found my diary, and are demanding i tell them how to decode it so they can read it. They are saying that i need to share this with them and i can't have secrets from them and im under their roof. I eventually got sick of it and told them to fuck off. They sent me to my room and I'm here. They keep trying to decode my diary which I doubt they will but fuck this sucks.EDIT: I'm making this post, hopefully this can knock some sense into my parents"
123,Not the A-hole,AITA for making a big deal about 1 extra credit point on my child's test?,29434,kb4og9,2358,"My daughter had a spelling test which included some holiday words for extra credit. One of the words was ""Chanukah"". My daughter spelled it the way I just did, but the teacher marked it wrong and corrected it to ""Hanukkah"". She said to my daughter ""you're Jewish and you don't know how to spell Hanukkah?"" I think she meant it jokingly but my daughter was annoyed. My daughter told the teacher that Chanukah is correct, but the teacher didn't believe her.I told the teacher that Chanukah was also correct and that my daughter should get the point, and the teacher argued with me, saying that Hanukkah is more correct because it's more commonly used than Chanukah. I said if any spelling is more correct it would be Chanukah because the Ch represents the sound from the back of the throat you're supposed to make.The teacher agreed to correct the test but seemed really sour about it and said she was just trying to be inclusive. I said I appreciate that but she should keep in mind that if the word isn't in English that there might be multiple acceptable spellings for it and that they should all be given credit.My husband says I overreacted. Honestly I probably wouldn't have bothered so much if the word was something else, but I resented the teacher, who isn't Jewish, arguing with me and my daughter about how to spell our own holiday."
124,Not the A-hole,AITA for punishing my sons and not the woman?,29352,h8ypa1,2505,"I’m going to try to keep this short since frankly - I’m exhausted. Any questions can and will be answered in the comments. Long story short, my family(35m, 12m, 10m) and I(32f) just recently moved into a new apartment complex. Our unit is at the very back of the building, at the back of the property, so behind us is just a wooded area, nobody lives there. At the very back of our unit and the one across from ours is a small balcony that faces out towards this wooded area. Because it the way the building is constructed, you can’t see onto another persons balcony unless you go to the stairs and lean over the railing - otherwise the wall blocks you.Across from our unit is a family of four - a young looking mother, her husband, and their two children who are both under the age of two. I haven’t had the chance to go introduce myself because I think one of their babies is a newborn, and honestly mama seems exhausted. Anyway, a couple of nights ago, I made a horrific discovery. Went outside to call the boys in for dinner and found them both with their upper bodies flung over the railing, staring into our neighbors balcony. I grab both by their pants and ask them just what they think they’re doing, and that’s when I see it. From their vantage point, they could see straight into the neighbor lady’s balcony, where she was sat completely topless, with underwear on listening to headphones. I. Was. Livid. Not with her, but with the boys. The way I see it, she’s on her own personal property, where no one is SUPPOSED to be able to see, and not drawing any attention to herself. Plus, if she’s breastfeeding, I get not having a top or bra on. It’s tedious to remove every few hours and for every feeding in between. And who wears pants in their own house? Anyway, I digress. I pulled the boys in the house and took away their video games and phones until further notice, and told my husband immediately when he got home. But surprisingly, HE was mad at ME! Saying boys would be boys and the lady should have some decency to wear clothes outside, and asked me to speak to her about it. I ripped him a new one and spent the night on the couch, after which he apologized but the boys still seem upset with me. AITA for punishing them, but not saying anything to the neighbor?Edit: Typo, and further explained question"
125,Not the A-hole,"AITA? My husband and I are getting my stepson a car for his birthday. His mother wants to chip in and say that the car is from all of us, but I don’t want to do that.",29334,dfzi7d,5424,"My stepson is turning 18 soon and my husband and I decided that we will be getting him a car. I make more than my husband does and we will be splitting the cost of the car 70/30. That’s fine with me.His mother is a woman who I make the effort to be civil with but don’t like. I am much younger than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background she had a lot of things to say about that. She called me her ex’s cash cow and that’s one of the better things she said about me. We are not friends and I won’t even describe her as nice to me.When my husband told her that we will buy my stepson a car for his birthday, she said she wants to chip in 5% of the cost and then we could tell my stepson that the gift is from all of his parents and step parents. I don’t want to do that. I don’t need her 5% and my stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share the cost of buying the car. I don’t want recognition for paying 70% of his gift’s cost but I don’t want to share my and my husband’s gift to my stepson with a woman who has always been antagonistic to me.I don’t know why she wants us to gift the car jointly now because we’ve never given my stepson a gift jointly before. And I don’t understand what’s so bad about getting separate gifts from me and his dad, and his mom and his stepdad.I know that many people will say that it’s better for my stepson to see that all his parents and step parents are getting along. I’m civil to his mom and I never talk negatively about her to him. Is that not enough? Am I incapable of being a good step mother to him if I’m not best friends with his mom? Do I have to let his mom get her way whenever she asks in the name of all parents getting along?"

He recently discovered a charity project where they fixed up an old Jaguar. It's worth around $300000. You could buy a ticket for $50 to enter and the money went towards a good cause.My bf is broke at the moment so I offered to go halves with the ticket. He didn't want to because then the car wouldn't be his completely. I wasn't too worried about it and didn't mention it again. I did however buy a ticket for myself.Well, I won and as of August 1st will be the owner of the car. When my boyfriend found out he was really excited until I told him that I was going to sell it and put half of it in my savings and invest half of it. he said I can't sell OUR car without consulting him. I told him it's MY car and I can do whatever I want. He now claims it was all a big misunderstanding and apparently he wanted to go halves but hasn't got around to giving me the money yet. I call bs on it but he keeps saying that we're a couple and we should make decisions together.AITA for going ahead with the plan to sell the car and keep the money to myself?Edit.

127,Not the A-hole,AITA for replying to a rude customer in the language they were speaking in front of me?,29309,exk08u,2532,"I'm a slave to the siren (a Starbucks barista). I'm pretty decent with most customers and I'm pretty good at having convos with customers and sensing when someone just wants the line moved forward.Anyway, I was on register the other day, taking people's orders. Two older men were ordering from me. One of them said ""a coffee, black"", so I just asked to clarify the size he wanted and the roast (blonde, medium or dark) to which he first spoke to his friend and said, rudely""Nou zeg, niet de slimste meid die hier werkt, hè? Ze zouden en beetje kunnen leeren om hun hersenen te gebruiken""Which is Dutch and translates roughly to ""Wow, (this is) not the smartest gal that works here, huh? They could learn to use their brains a little""Then he told me he wanted a medium dark roast. So I nodded and then replied to him in Dutch, asking him the regular questions I would to complete an order (anything else to eat or drink today?, What was your name for your other drinks? Do you have a Starbucks rewards card?). I was perfectly pleasant and smiley for the rest of the transaction but just conducted it in Dutch. He answered the questions in English but his eyes were bulging out of his head. His friend looked kind of worried but burst out laughing when they walked away.I realize it might not be the best look for someone in service, and when my coworker asked me what it was about and I explained, she seemed kinda confused as to why I would do that.I don't think it was an asshole move because I was still nice to the guy but I definitely called him out and made it clear to him that I'd understood the stuff he was saying.

His mother surrendered her rights and is no longer in the picture. I work 4am-12pm at a gas station and I raise my son, that's what I do these days. Only one of my friends still speaks to me and hangs out with me. I live at home with my parents and sister (21) and pay a small rent each month. I can't afford to move out with the baby. My parents help me when they can. My sister doesn't like my son, she once told me she thinks he's an annoyance and hinderance. If he cries she complains. If there's baby clothes in the laundry she complains. Basically the baby exists and that pisses her off. I'm not perfect but I'm trying my best to be a good dad. My sister has never offered to help with the baby beyond holding him briefly and she hasn't done that more than about four or five times since he was born.The other day my friend called and offered me a really great opportunity for some side-work. He works construction and they needed an extra guy for some installation work. Four hours and I'd get $400.00. I jumped at it, any extra money can only help. I started trying to find a babysitter. My sister was hanging out in the living room while I walked around the house on the phone. I managed to find a sitter who said she didn't want to be paid and went to get the baby ready. My sister asked me why I didn't ask her when she was sitting right there. I told her I didn't think she'd want to since she'd never offered to help before. She told me it was different, this was for work and not just me wanting to sleep or whatever, and he was about to go down for his nap and he's pretty easy when first wakes up, she told me it wouldn't be a problem.I asked her why she didn't say something between phone calls and she said she didn't think she needed too because we're family and family asks each other for help. I reminded her of all the times she'd complained about the baby and me and called him names and told me she waited he'd never been born and asked her why she thought I'd ever trust her with my son. She started crying and told me that wasn't fair and I needed to remember that the whole house was dealing with a baby and she was just having a hard time adjusting but she'd never do anything to hurt him. I told her she should have spoken to me about her feelings instead of acting like a child, took my son and left. When I got home both my parents set in on me because my sister told them I'd accused her of bad intentions to the baby. AITA for being honest when my sister offered to babysit?ETA: apparently God is on my side right now. The lady I mentioned in the post who babysat my son for me, she goes to church with my mom and when I dropped my son off I explained that I was having trouble finding a sitter or paying for daycare. She called the pastor and explained the situation and two days a week my son can attend the church nursery school from 7am-12pm for free!!, and the lady has offered to take my son one day a week during the same time-frame and has also found another lady who will take him for one day a week, same time-frame. The ladies both requested $50.00, which I'm happy to pay. That means there's only one day a week and three hours in the mornings that I need childcare and my mom has agreed to watch him for the three hours and drop him off! I still have to figure out Fridays but Monday-Thursday are covered. I can breathe again."
129,Not the A-hole,AITA for spiking my leftovers with Ghost Pepper flakes to teach my brother a lesson,29139,cavukv,1267,"So my little brother is notorious for eating other people's food knowing it's not his. After several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. A few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. I wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing I'd eat it the next day. Since all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. I got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. I open the fridge grab MY BOX and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. I know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so I knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. I'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. Knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon I decided to sprinkle Ghost Pepper flakes on the last two slices. We actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. So I'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. This fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more. After he finishes nuking it he bites into one slice and I get up to the fridge to grab and hide the milk. I hear him freaking out and he didn't stop crying for an hour."
130,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my parents I won't drive my brother to school unless he is more hygienic because his smell literally makes me sick?,29111,d1wohr,2136,"I'm a high school senior and my brother is a high school freshman. I have a car that I bought with money I'd saved from work, and I pay my own gas. However my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.They said I need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. And the problem is that I get motion sick easily even when I'm driving. Too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when I'm in a car make me feel ill too.I'm not exaggerating, I've always been like this. As a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. I always make sure I know where my barf bag is on a plane. I always used to take motion sickness pills, but I'm not allowed when I'm driving because they make you tired.Anyway, I can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me I literally feel so sick because of his BO. Even with the windows on my side openMy friend told me I should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. Right now, he doesn't do that, he likes to sleep in to the last minute, skip showers most days, pick clothes up off the floor to wear, skip brushing his teeth, etc.So I did that and told my mom and dad that I couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. Either they could check or I would. And they blew up at me saying that I was being nasty and humiliating, that if I wouldn't drive my brother I couldn't drive. And I said fine I'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.And that caused a big fight, because I guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.AITA for what I did?"
131,Not the A-hole,"AITA for getting my family to do a ""swear tax"" after my dad told me off for swearing? (My dad and brothers cuss like sailors but apparently me cussing is unladylike?)",29067,hfr4xe,987,"I am living with my family, it's me a 15 year old girl, my twin brothers who are 17, and my parents.My dad cusses a lot, and so do my older brothers. But apparently the standards are different for me, my dad overheard me saying a couple cuss words when I was on the phone with my friends and he got mad at me for my language, and for how trashy and unladylike it was.This wasn't the first time he called me (and only me) out for bad language, but it was the one that frustrated me the most because I could tell there was a double standard.I thought of calling him out on his language and hipocracy, but then I had a different idea.---I said that yeah, it was a bad habit I was forming and didn't want to make a pattern... because if I got in the habit of cussing a lot, that wouldn't make me come off well when I start getting jobs or going to college. And as I was growing up, I wanted to learn how to speak respectfully and intelligently.But it was hard to keep from bad habits, when I heard him and my brothers having potty-mouth-syndrome so often. They're setting an example whether they realize it or not... So I wanted to work on things for myself, but also together as a family. I suggested we make a ""Swear Tax"" where if anyone swears in front of anyone else who's participating, they give a dollar to each person who heard them. I'd want that rule for myself because it would keep me accountable and I'd really like it if the family joined me for it...----So my dad said he'd join, and so would my mom. They got my brothers to be a part of it too. They didn't really have a choice, my parents decided to make it a rule.I know it's kinda petty but I wanted to make the point that my dad and brothers swear a lot and I almost never do. In the few months we've had the rule, I've gotten about 250 dollars from hearing my dad and brothers cuss, and have not sworn once. It's kinda making my brothers angry because they often cuss when they're mad, and I ask them for money, so they get madder and cuss more, so I get more money until they shut up.My dad actually got mad at me too, he was having some drinks, calling his brother and talking, and I came over after and asked for 18 dollars. He actually said he wouldn't give me that much, and there should be a cutoff. He gave me 5 dollars which sends a weird message... Like swearing is bad, unless you wanna swear A LOT, then it's cool??I feel like I've made my point already so really now I'm just continuing to ""want the family to learn not to cuss"" for the money, and it's really making my brothers mad.AITA for having the idea for the ""family swear tax"" after my dad got angry at me for swearing? I did it because I know I swear the least out of my family but I was the only one getting in trouble for it"
132,Not the A-hole,AITA for having pot cookies out in the open in my own home?,29032,hc7wd7,1508,"this is an ongoing situation, and am currently writing this as my niece is having a full-on meltdown. so I apologize for any mistakes.today was my day off and i decided to whip up a batch of pot cookies (cookies that have weed extract in them) so i can snack on them for the weekend. after they finish baking i left them out on a cooling tray so they can set. just as i finished cleaning up the kitchen i hear the door bell and went to answer, and surprise surprise it's my sister with 8yo niece and husband. it's been awhile since I've last seen them to it was a happy surprise. i let them in, and the smell of cookies still in the air, and niece goes bolting towards the kitchen. i instantly go chasing her and as i round the corner into the kitchen, niece had just grabbed a cookie and was about to eat it, quick on my feet i swooped in and grabbed the cookie out of her hand saying that these were adult cookies. which caused niece to start freaking out. my sister followed in and i explained to her that these cookies had pot in them and assured her i was able to take the cookie away from niece before she had ate any.she instantly blows up at me saying i shouldn't have pot cookies out when there are kids in the house, i explained how i had just finished baking them and they were setting, and the fact that i didn't expect ANY children to be around (i am a single man, no kids), she asked if i had any thing that wasn't ""laced"" and unfortunately i didn't, by this point niece has locked herself in the bathroom and is crying.and my sister gave me a big ol' lecture about having drugs in reach of kids, while i stand on the premise of, there wouldn't be an issue *if i had even known they were planning on dropping by today.* she called me a huge irresponsible asshole, and i responded ""well maybe if you taught your daughter to not just grab shit, we wouldn't be in this mess!""she left to try to get niece out of the bathroom and i'm sat here typing this, am i really the asshole here? like i can understand not having drugs out in the open with kids around, and i never would - *if i had known there were going to be kids around.*also, before i get any flak, i'm in Canada and weeds legal here."
133,Not the A-hole,AITA? My parents took most of my wardrobe away as punishment and I said I didn't want the clothes back because it's obvious they're not actually mine.,28999,g5hta8,2957,"I got in trouble at school this fall, I'm a junior in high school. (Edit to add what I got in trouble for since a couple people asked... I smoked weed with a guy in the woods after school once and got caught. I also made out with him a couple times and my parents found out about that too)As punishment my parents took away a lot of my things all my clothes except 3 pairs of plain jeans and 3 plain black shirts and my coat. And all my makeup and hair stuff, purses and shoes saying I had to earn things back with good behavior, I don't get to engage in my hobby (fashion) till I've earned it.Anyway it was a shitty couple months but I came to a couple realizations.It was actually kind of nice to not have to think about what to wear and how I look.  My friends knew what my parents had done and didn't judge me. I also told anyone who asked why I looked like I only had one outfit what was up and it was no big deal.I know it was supposed to be a demeaning humiliating punishment to make me look bad at school but honestly it just makes them look bad when people at school know I'm only allowed to wear one thing.I don't want to have things that are just something someone else can hold over my head. I don't want the old clothes and makeup back, if I'm gonna get back into that stuff I'll do it on my own terms I'll buy my own stuff.So I told my parents that I don't care if they keep the clothes and makeup they've made it clear that stuff doesn't belong to me. And it's gross to me to spend every day wearing clothes that aren't mine, that can be given and taken as punishment. I'd feel gross and I'd rather not wear them again.So now my parents are mad because they've got a lot of clothes boxed up in the attic that the family spent money on and that are going to waste. Nobody else can wear them my mom isn't my size and my only sibling is my little brother.I said I don't care, I want clothes that are my own and those aren't it. AITA for not taking the clothes back and letting them go to waste?"
134,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for running away on our honeymoon?,28961,f2f25v,1782,"(not from my husband)My husband and I are on our honeymoon. His parents gifted us a week in an all inclusive hotel at no cost to us as a wedding gift, and we were really grateful. On arriving we found out that they'd also booked a room at this hotel for themselves for the whole week and want to do group things. Outside of this, we see them maybe 2 or 3 times a year for a couple days at a time as he finds them a bit overbearing at times and they don't really like me.It's not like they're in the room next door or anything and we can still do stuff in our room alone but they knock on our door regularly, waking us up at 6am, making us get all 3 meals a day with them. We've tried telling them we wanted ""alone time"" for our honeymoon and they shrugged us off saying that's what our room is for. We also tried faking illness to get out of eating with them and they just got room service to our room and sat with us while we faked stomach aches. My husband snapped earlier and said this whole thing was way over the line and they had no right intruding on our honeymoon of all things, and they told us that they paid for this whole thing and that as adults we're allowed to take holidays at the same time to the same place.We've been talking and we saved up to pay for our own honeymoon before they surprised us. We still have the money we would have spent in our joint wedding/honeymoon account. There's another town we wanted to go to on our honeymoon and we looked it up and we could get tickets from here to there and then back home for less than £60 total. We could also book a few days in a nice hotel for about half of what's left in our wedding/honeymoon fund and use the remainder of the week we booked off in another town without his parents knowing we'd left until we had.It's 9pm now, there's trains from here to the other town every hour, plus more half-hourly trains tomorrow.Would we be the arseholes if we ran away from his parents without telling them?Update: our train should be arriving in our final station in the next 30 mins, we've found a hotel that's able to take us tonight, and we are very excited about the next 4 days"
135,Not the A-hole,"AITA for insisting if I can't have my partner over, neither can anyone else?",28888,degzhj,3188,"Throwaway bc flatmates have reddit. So I [20m] live in a flat with 3 other people childhood best friend [23f], a guy from my uni course [20m] and his cousin [26f]. For the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. However this has been a real point of contention lately. About six months ago I began a relationship with a guy I've known for a couple of years [21m]. I know it's still a fairly new relationship but I really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. Up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. This was mostly due to the fact that I have chronic fatigue and going on ""proper"" dates can be really challenging for me. Instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch TV and get takeout or cook together. I didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10PM because of his work schedule. So the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that I need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's ""starting to get annoying"". I asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there ""skulking around all the time"". I pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. She said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's ""getting ridiculous"". Note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. I confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. I asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. I pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.My potential assholery: I've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  If I answer the door to anyone's partner I'll send them away. If I come home and someone's partner is there I'll make a point to mention that I thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. I've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. Everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me I'm being unreasonable. I know I'm being petty, but I think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and I'm trying to make that point. Am I really the asshole here?ETA: some questions people keep asking: 1. If I knew of something my boyfriend was doing to be annoying/if anyone had told me that he was doing something I'd have included it. I'm not aware of anything he does and when I ask why 26f doesn't like him I just get a shrug and ""just do"". I will also state I'm bi, and she's never had an issue with any female partners I've had. 2. We don't hang out in the living room much. We literally only use it if there's something we want to watch that I can't get on my bedroom TV and there's nobody else in there. We use the kitchen more often than the living room, but honestly even that isn't that often (we eat far too much takeout pizza rip) 3. A lot of people seem confused so just clearing up who's who in the situation: the one who brought all this up is 26F, *not* my best friend. My best friend is 23F. Not to get too much into a tangent, but basically just over a year ago I was moving out of halls at university and 23F was looking for a new place so we decided to move in together. At the same time, a dude from my course - 20M - was looking for a flatshare. We couldn't find a 3 bed but found a really nice 4 bed and he mentioned his cousin - 26F - was also looking for somewhere to live so she got on board too. I only met her last year and we don't really know each other very well.4. By chronic fatigue I mean chronic fatigue syndrome sorry that's apparently so unclear."
136,Not the A-hole,AITA for proving to my roommate that her boyfriend keeps hitting on me?,28700,flvmtn,1669,"I’m Sam, my roommates name is Lauren, and her boyfriends name is Mark. Lauren and Mark have been dating for maybe four months. Mark always hits on me. Like always. As soon as Lauren walks away, Mark is laying it on thick with compliments, and asking when our lease is up. I wear a lot of body-con and sometimes low cut clothing , so I expect to get glances maybe mild staring. But this guy is very obviously hitting on me, and often times in ways that make me uncomfortable, especially since he is always at our apartment.  I have told Lauren several times that Mark hits on me, and she just rolls her eyes. She doesn’t believe me, which is confusing to me. Lauren and I have been roommates for five years. In that time she has dated three other guys, and I have never complained about this before. So yesterday she tells me that Mark is coming over. I was like, great, I told her if she would just walk upstairs in our apartment building, and tell Mark that she was going around the block, she would walk in and see him hitting on me. She actually agreed to do it to “humor” me. Mark gets to the apartment, and I am just doing the dishes, I tell him that Lauren went to the store up the block, but she is really right outside the door. He sits at the counter and starts chatting with me normally, then the conversation turns to him hitting on me. Normally I just walk away from Mark, but I endured it so that Lauren would see/hear.She came in and told Mark to go to her room. Then she then she starts yelling at *ME*. Saying I saying I tried to seduce him and that I dressed like a slut. And I’m like “I *always* dress like a slut Lauren! Who cares! Your boyfriend is hitting on me!”We argued and both said some shitty stuff to each other. She and Mark are staying in her bedroom and we haven’t spoken to each other since. As I’m thinking about it, I’m wondering if I am an asshole for even trying to do this but at the same time I think she sucks for not believing me in the first place. I live in New York. I love my neighborhood I don’t want to have to find a new roommate because of this idiot. If I did an asshole thing please tell me. AITA"
137,Not the A-hole,AITA for cutting up and altering my wedding dress into a functional dress instead of giving it to my sister who can't afford an expensive dress?,28700,erfvwt,2545,"I need an unbiased opinion on this because I don't know if i was the asshole.Throwaway because I am active in other communities and I don't want this to mix.So I was supposed to get married 2 moths ago to my ex partner of 5 years. Sadly we broke it off because he cheated on me on his bachelor party with a striper.I had this beautiful dress that cost me arround 2k dollars (out of my pocket). I had been very depressed since everything happened because I felt it was somehow my fault for not being sexy enough or not giving him what he wanted. So last weekend I decided to ""take my power back"" and I began altering the dress. I have been sewing for 15 plus years so I know what I am doing. I cut it a bit, changed the color to something less wedding-y and after a week of work I had a beautiful gown that I could use for more stuff.The problem comes now. I uploaded that picture of the dress to Instagram with a caption that said something along the lines of "" you can change the worst memories"" or some shit like that.My sister hits me up and asks me if that was my old wedding dress and I told her yes. She then called me and asked me why I had done this. I asked her why it was such a big deal. And she told me that I could have waited till after he wedding. I was so confused. Then she reminded me that when we were staying at the hotel where my wedding was supposed to happen my mom and sister where there cheering me up and my sister said something along the lines of ""oh well if you are not using it i will"". We all laughed so I thought it was a joke because it was never brought up again after. She just asked me once what material it was so I assumed she wanted something similar.Now my sister is mad at me and my mom says she understands our povs. But that I could have waited 5 more moths till after her wedding to ""take my power back""AITA?Edit : yes he fucked the stripper please stop asking meEdit2: what the fuck is wrong with some of you. Suddenly I am the asshole for leaving my ex for cheating on me because it doesn't count because it was his bachelor party? Do you know how relationships work. Are you also going to tell me that if he cheated on a Saturday it wouldn't count? Or if he left the country? This is hilarious coming from a sub that says cheaters are the worst people In this world. Cheating is cheating period"
138,Not the A-hole,"AITA For walking out on a double date my friend set up with him, his girlfriend and a girl I had already rejected before",28679,hgr9s6,1366,"I feel like I need to say this for this post not to be removed, this is not about the date, about relationships or something I want a judgement on me walking out of there.Cast: Me (25M), Joe(26M), Jane(24F)To give you a little background to this situation, I met Jane through Joe's girlfriend at her birthday party last year. At first Jane was fun to talk to but not even an hour later Jane was really in to me and tried really badly to hit on me during the party, which pretty much ruined my time there as the feeling was not mutual in the slightest bit also at the time I was already with someone. So the first impression I got from Jane was that she was clingy, annoying and just wouldn't stop bothering me.Unfortunately for me she became part of my larger friend group because she is part of Joe's girlfriends friend group(That is a mouthful sheesh) and because me and Joe hang out a lot and I am also friends with his girlfriend, I pretty much run in to her at minimum twice a month.So first time Jane asked me out was a month after that party, I informed her I was with someone and not interested, she tried again a 2 months later when I broke up with my then girlfriend, again I declined her advances and told her I was not interested. I got in to a new relationship not long after but unfortunately she and I broke up about 2 months ago. Since then as you might have anticipated, Jane has asked me out again, I said no again.Well that brings us to this week, everything has been opening up here and Joe had been trying to fix me up with a friend of his girlfriend and would not tell me who(He is well aware of me having rejected Jane multiple times and the fact I am not interested in her, he knows this in detail.) After a lot of what he calls convincing and I call whining(I had no interest in dating anytime soon) I relented and decided to agree to this double date idea of his.We agree on meeting at Joe's apartment and lo and behold Joe, His girlfriend and Jane are occupying  the dinner table obviously intending for my date to be Jane, I honestly just got so goddamn angry I that I couldn't even get a single word out, turned around and left.I have been bombarded with texts and calls about how much of a douche I am and how terribly I hurt Jane and so on and I am just like, I literally rejected her like three times, I am not interested in her, you knew that, your girlfriend knew that, our entire friend group has a running joke about obsessive Jane FFS so literally everyone knows it. So am I the asshole?"
139,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my husband to lose the entitled attitude and do shit for himself?,28666,j5jidt,1770,"Just recently my husband (31) was promoted to assistant manager of the warehouse. We both work on the ups of 50 hours a week. I am shift manager at a behavioral disorders facility. Both jobs are very hands on and strenuous. Since his promotion he has developed an entirely different attitude. Extremely entitled and dare I say rude as all fuck. He is always boasting and bragging. This has been going on for 3 weeks. So, some examples are as followed: on his days off he wants the house to be radio silent. If our 4 year old wants to play, he tells her to stick to her bedroom because he needs peace and quiet after ""working so hard"". If I make our daughter lunch, he will immediately say ""wheres mine?"" He asks me to grab him things damn near constant all hours of the night. He expects nightly back rubs but if I ask he will scoff at me and say ""I worked all day"" (even if I had as well). He expects meals that HE likes made every night, regardless if me or our daughter like the meal or not. He also now acts like he has full say over the money because he ""makes more"". Last night was the tip of the iceberg for me. Before this I let a lot of shit slide because it was a recent promotion and hell, hes excited! So, I get it. But last night around like 11pm (I was in bed scrolling through my phone) he comes into the bedroom, lays down and says ""babe you should go make me some ice cream. I want the chocolate drizzle on it. And oh, dont forget the cashews!"" Then he starts scrolling through his phone. I ignore it because I feel at this point I was going to snap. He then shook my leg and said ""Did you hear me?"" So I responded with ""Yeah. I did hear you and no. Go make it yourself. You were literally just out there. Your sense of fucking entitlement is way out of line. Do shit for yourself."" He became offended and instantly, like fucking clock work, said ""But I worked all fucking day!"" So I snapped back with ""Yeah, I did too! In fact, I worked 12 hours to your 8. Like I said, do shit for yourself."" He is now saying that he is not acting entitled and that I was just taking my bad day out on him and that everything I said makes him feel unappreciated. AITA? Did I push it too far?"
140,Not the A-hole,"AITA for refusing to sell the place I bought with ""stripper money""?",28649,ibbwws,3953,"For several years I was a stripper. I have no shame about what I did, and only quit when I got a better job offer. In the time I worked as a stripper, I intentionally lived as cheaply as possible (shitty little studio flat, living off ramen, wearing old clothes) because my coworkers all told me that they were able to buy their own places on their income, so long as they saved like crazy. Before I ""retired"", I managed to outright buy myself a 3 bedroom flat. I rented out the other rooms for a while but I got sick of having roommates, so now I have them up online for shorter stays, but not to rent.I met this guy about 18 months ago, and we've been together since. He knows about my employment history, and he said that he has no issue with it, though he did ask me to tell his family the white lie I occasionally use (on my CV and stuff), which is that I was a waitress (which I kind of was tbf).A month ago we found out that I'm 2 months pregnant. He says this is great news, and we should move in together. I assumed he'd be moving into my place because he rents his (far smaller 1 bedroom) flat while I own mine, and I have room for a baby's room while he doesn't. Also, I really don't want to leave my flat. It's my flat, I love it, I could see myself living here for the rest of my life, and I don't want to lose the security of owning a flat and have to go back to paying rent or a mortgage each month.However, he then said that he didn't want to move into my place, and said I should sell it and we buy a place together. I said that I like my place, it means a lot to me that I was able to buy it, and it represents years of working my arse off scrimping and saving. He then said that he understands all of that, but we should be living together by the time the baby comes and he didn't want to live in my flat. I asked him why not - it's a great flat, it's central to everything, it's spacious, it's got room for all his stuff, there's a daycare in the building (run/owned by another tenant) and a school 5 minute walk away, the list goes on - and he said that he didn't want to live in a flat that was bought with ""stripper money"".That really pissed me off, and I told him no fucking way am I selling my flat and that he never had an issue with my ""stripper money"" paying for this flat before now. I said I wasn't giving up the security of owning a home for someone who tries to make me feel ashamed about something I don't feel ashamed of. He said that his point is if I sold the flat then we could get a new place with the money from the sale. I said ""wouldn't that still be stripper money?"" and he said ""that's different"", and I asked how. He then said he was going back to his place because ""I can't talk to you when you're in this state"".He's gone back to his flat now and he's texted me saying I'm overreacting/irrational and I need to think of this realistically rather than emotionally. He says he wouldn't feel right raising a child in my flat knowing how I purchased it and selling/moving is the best idea of all of us, not to mention the fact he isn't on the deed because it's my place and it ""would never feel like our place"" because of this.I feel I might be the arse because I get why he might feel like it's just my place and I feel I'm being too rigid in a time we need to work together, plus I spoke to my sister and she sided with him so 2 out of 3 people think I'm in the wrong here.AITA?Update on the off chance anyone sees this: I dumped him. There was a whole conversation and during the conversation he said he didn't want to be a parent if I wasn't willing to do everything he wanted, including sharing a house/deed (plus staying together). Also, at the start of the conversation I said what a few people suggested, which was that I'd be willing to sell and split the house with him, provided he paid 50%, and he got very very angry, very very quickly. He also said a few other things, so IDK how it's all going to pan out just yet, but it looks like I'm going to be a single mother."
141,Not the A-hole,AITA for giving my wife an ultimatum about getting a dog?,28635,hreyxc,2770,"I had a dog when my wife and I got married. I loved her, she was my buddy. When my wife got pregnant, she became increasingly paranoid that the dog would be a danger to the baby. She brought up rehoming, and I refused. She was an ""aggressive breed"", but she was trained. One day, she called me crying at work that the dog ran away and she couldn't run after her. I believed her. I looked for that dog for weeks. I finally just accepted it because we had to go to the hospital to welcome our child and there were just other pressing concerns.It's been 5 years since then, and we now have three children. I've wanted to get a new dog, but the kids take a lot of energy and time. My wife has always had a new excuse not to get another dog. I found out recently that my dog didn't run away, my wife and her father took the dog to the pound while I was at work because her parents agreed with her about the dog being ""dangerous"".I'm FURIOUS. She was MY dog, my BABY. She wasn't dangerous. I would never have agreed to that. She probably never got adopted. I'm honestly mad enough to consider a separation if not for the kids and practical reasons. I've told her that the only way to make it up even a little bit is for us to get a dog. She ultimately doesn't want a dog at all, and complained that she would have to do too much with it. I'm not planning to let up on this one this time."
142,Not the A-hole,AITA For Offering A Drink To A Girl In A Bar And Then Not Paying For It?,28551,grrijp,2023,"I'm m23 and few months ago I was at a nice bar in Toronto with my boys and I saw this really hot girl. Decided to shoot my shot and we spoke and danced for a bit and I offered to buy her a drink and she gladly accompanied me to the bar, when I got there I was like can I have a beer and whatever she wants. She promptly says can I get 4 double shots of 1942. Thats like $75 a shot for a double of 1942 and I was like wtf and she said there for her friends and patted me on the back. When the bartender came back I slapped a $10 bill on the table and told him she'd be covering the shots and walked away. She was pissed and yelling the normal insults lol. Well it turns out my mom works with her and they were talking and my mom showed her a picture of me (god damn it mom!) and she instantly recognized me and remembered my name and told my mom about what I did. My mom then called me and said I'm a huge asshole and told me to send her the cost of the 4 drinks which was like $325 with tips. I just laughed and told my mom I'm not doing that and my mom said that the girl thinks I'm a huge asshole and douche and she agrees LOL. AITA?"
143,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my son that if he changes his last name then I’m no longer his Father?,28388,d9fawt,4383,"Let me start off by saying my son, Adam, is 22 years old. Back when my ex wife, Tori, and I were trying for kids we found out that I was infertile. We decided we’d adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. I was thrilled because I thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. No, I was wrong. My ex wife cheated on me and I didn’t find out until 20 years later. Tori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he’s not my biological son. My ex and I divorced a few weeks later. Ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological Father. He did and they started to become really close. It hurt me much more than I thought it would. He’s an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. They started to bond really well, and all of a sudden Adam became really distant from me. It’s been like this for almost a year and a half. I try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he’s busy with Chris (biological Father). I tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. We used to do stuff every other week but it’s been completely different since he found out about Chris.I couldn’t stand it. My son who I raised since he was a baby treated me like I didn’t matter. Any time we’d actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. What I mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. I’d ask him how classes or friends were and he’d just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. He also changed his major from Econ to Computer Science and didn’t even mention it to me until a year later. I told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he’d do better. He never did. I told him numerous times and he never changed. He was still distant.What was the final straw for me was the phone conversation I had with him last week. He said he was going to change his last name to Chris’ because he liked it so much and because they were close. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I told him this “I can’t believe you are going to do this. That’s really disappointing to me. If you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then I’m no longer your Father and I don’t want to be involved in your life.” He hung up on me. I didn’t even bother reaching out because I know he wouldn’t respond. I stand by what I said. I meant every word and still do. The last name change to me means he no longer views me as a Father and views Chris as his (despite the fact he’s 22).My family told me I’m being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it’s reasonable. I was told to post it here. So Reddit am I being an asshole?INFO: Something to add. After I found out about Chris I took a couple of days and didn’t speak to my ex wife or Adam. They didn’t contact me. I didn’t contact them. I needed a break.Edit 2: A lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and I think I finally figured out why he’s been so cold. A few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. His Grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that I am fully in charge of. Enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. After a semester of university he started dating this girl. He was head over heels in love with her. I never met the girl so I have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. Suddenly after a few months of dating Adam asked me for about $3K to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. I already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. I asked Adam why he needed the money. He said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. I told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. He spent over 1K on her in just under a few months. He would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. To me she was just after my son’s inheritance and I was right. What I said to him was basically this “Adam, you haven’t been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn’t sit well with me. That’s the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. If you 2 were more serious then I would think about it, but I’m not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend.” Turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. They broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. He was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. Then we found out about my ex’s affair. I don’t know if that’s the real reason he’s so cold. That was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him."
144,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling my ""nephew"" his ps4 was going to be destroyed to teach him a lesson?",28354,ek4u98,2406,"Ok. I fucked up.My brother-in-law saw one of those stupid videos where they destroy the video game console in front of the child to teach him a lesson. I heard him planning on doing that to my nephew because he failed 2 courses at school (he is 12). I tried talking them out of it, telling them that's not the way, sell it, hide it, whatever just don't do it.... that was my point.I told my nephew, what they were going to do, and asked him not to overreact, just tell them you are disappointed, or something that makes them feel bad, if he brings his grades up, I will get him a new PS4, but I want his stupid parents to feel guilty.Last week, my brother-in-law sat him a chair, have a couple of assholes friends holding him and proceed to destroy the ps4 with a baseball bat, while laughing and yelling and recording.My nephew had a poker face, did not move at all,  and whisper something and laughed. His dad stopped asked everybody to shut up and asked him, what? why are you laughing about?My nephew said: You humiliated me, you took something that was mine, and humiliated me in front of everybody.  You are bigger, stronger... but everybody is helpless when they are asleep. I am laughing because everybody is helpless when they are sleeping.... If you are done, I want to go inside, there something I need to think about.He had an entire week to prepare what to say, and this is what he came up with, and his delivery was fucking scary, I was speechless, everybody was shocked. I said out loud, good parenting everybody, good job, and went after my nephew.I spoke with my nephew afterward,  and he said that he will tell no one I had told him, and he has no plans on doing anything to his parents at all, he just wants to teach him a lesson as I suggested.Now, my sister book an appointment with a psychologist, they are sleeping with locks on their doors and caused a family crisis.And I feel like an asshole because I just have to tell them what I did to patch things, but honestly, I just want to see where this is going.Edit.I tried to answer as many comments as possible but I will provide some more context.1. My nephew told me he heard a similar line in a mafia movie, but he doesn't remember which, he told he wrote down some ideas to make the parents feel guilty and chose that one.2. it did happen. I am aware of how unbelievably bad-ass it sound. I share it because I was feeling guilty and because I was proud of my nephew's epic response.3. The father tried hiding the controller once to punish him, but he sneak a second controller he borrowed from a friend. They are not abusive parents all the time. They saw a video online, thought it will teach him a lesson. I disagree and thought it was outright traumatic since they didn't listen I thought to give my nephew a heads up.4. My sister is super paranoic. Her husband is concerned about his response, but not because he is afraid for his life. My sister is. Which makes things worse for me.5. I thought it was a fun thing to share, they are not bad people, they do weird stuff like taking pictures of my nephews and niece holding signs when they do something wrong (shame pictures), nothing physical, nothing really abusive, this was the first and for the looks the last time.6. I don't think there is much to update, they will go to therapy and most likely will patch things out. If something worth sharing or worthy of talking about, I will post it.7. yes, I feel very proud of my nephew. keeping it cool while it was happening it was way more than what I could have possibly expected.Edit 2In retrospective and after reading some comments, they really need therapy. When you see it every day it is hard to notice that some behavior could be toxic. I don't regret what I did, and definitely don't regret posting it here. Reddit can be really insightful sometimes. Thanks for your comments."
145,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not telling a vegan mom that the candy she stole from my kids and was eating, wasn’t vegan?",28317,joxhic,1946,"This happened on Halloween and the day following.My neighbor, 38F (super vegan) has 2 kids. I (26F) also have 2 kids. My apartment complex didn’t do traditional tick or treating on Halloween.Residents were advised to set out prepackaged individual candy bags on their patios/front door areas if they wanted to participate- but the traditional “knock on door, physically hand strangers candy” was not permitted.So, Halloween comes and the kids are all dressed up and each building has a scheduled time where the kids go door to door. I ended up having to work late so my neighbor offered to walk my kids around with hers at our buildings scheduled time. About 45 minutes later my kids came home with a small bucket of candy (6 little goodie bags each from individual apartments that participated) everything was fine, and my kids didn’t say anything weird had happened. They were just excited to eat candy once they got home lol.The next day I took my kids to the park directly across from our apartment complex. My neighbor was there with her kids as well. The kids were playing and she took out one of those individual goodie bags with candy in it from her purse and started to loudly rummage in it. She ate several pieces of candy and my daughter eventually noticed, ran up and asked if she could have a piece and my neighbor responded “nope, this is my tax candy, remember that This was my reward for taking you trick or treating last night” I was a little weirded out by that statement and asked what she meant.She said that since she Is the one who had to take the kids out, she took FIVE bags from each of my kids as a “tax.”Her son then chimes in and said “you only took two bags from us!” she responded with “but I’m your mom, I was doing OP a favor so they get a higher candy tax” I was thinking about how to respond when I noticed that she was holding a starburst candy and decided to just smile and nod and go back to watching my kids. I let her continue To finish off the bag of candy and then said “hey, aren’t you vegan? You know a lot of those candies are made with animal products right. “I explained what gelatin was and how a LOT of those candies are made with it.She was horrified, googles it and then told her kids that they were leaving. She said something about how she was going to be sick and stormed off. Now she’s giving me dirty looks every time we see her and won’t let her kids play if she shows up at the park and we are there.My husband thinks I’m an asshole cause I should have either- not said anything about the gelatin, or said something right away when I noticed. I don’t think it’s my job to tell a vegan what is and isn’t vegan though, and she deserved it for stealing candy from little kids.Edit #1 when we got home from the park after the gelatin incident, I sat my kids down and asked why they didn’t tell me that the neighbor took half of their candy. My oldest kid is six and my youngest kid is four. Six year old explained that as they went door-to-door during their designated trick-or-treating time she would have my four year old grab two bags instead of one from each apartment for the majority of them, she explained it to my kids that they were grabbing extra bags for her to be handed over at the end as taxation. So either freaking way she was directly taking candy from my kids or taking candy *from other kids through* mine. As for the authenticity of her vegansim- I may have exaggerated when I said “super vegan” when I first posted this. She claims to be vegan and is very, very in peoples faces about the benefits etc. it’s 100% about the health side- she brags about veganism curing cancer, diabetes, even some mental health issues. I have never once heard her talk about the benefits for animals. She also sells herbal tea products, customized gym clothing etc. so she totes a pretty big vegan “lifestyle” if that makes sense. Now for the gelatin. She knows what gelatin is, she knows what it’s made out of, she knows that there are obvious things that she can’t eat. But she had no idea that a lot of candy specifically had gelatin apparently. When I told her that they had gelatin in it, she knew what gelatin was but googled the candies to see if I was correct.I think she is either really dumb or she eats non vegan stuff all the time when no ones watching and had to pretend to be horrified about it at this point, cause a lot of you guys have pointed out that you literally can’t be vegan and not know these things. I’m not vegan, I’m not even freaking vegetarian and I know these things. About the starbursts: a lot of you have said that starburst are vegan friendly. However starburst in the USA are made with animal gelatin. In the UK they ARE vegan though! )EDIT #2 I cannot thank you guys enough for all the insight on this, and if it weren’t for you all commenting and me being able to show my husband, he probably wouldn’t have told me what was actually wrong. Turns out he was calling me an asshole cause she’s been parking in his assigned parking spot and giving him dirty looks since this happened. I had no idea because I work from home and haven’t used the car in days. He finally told me why he was so grumpy about what I did. He hates confrontation and was miss placing his anger at me. I’m gonna talk to her about it first, then management if it doesn’t stop. I also bought several bags of candy that our entire family has been snacking on since lol."
146,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking this girl out of my house after she mistook my UK flag for a confedrate flag? And was planning to get us fired from our jobs?,28109,iib8f9,2623,"So for a bit of background, we are all in our mid 20s and live in the USA. Me and two of my friends rent out a decent size house and we had a get together. My roommate is friends with these two girls call them Kate and Jess, and they invite with them a new friend call her Ashley. Now Ashley when she comes over I see that she is recording us, I thought she was just posting to her Instagram and Snapchat. I don't pay attention to any of it really. I notice that she is just video taping a lot, so I am like Kate can you check on your friend like whats going on? Turns out.. she thought that the UK flag we have hanging in our living room was a confederate flag. And she was getting ""Evidence against us."" When she found out that it wasn't everyone just acted like it was a huge joke. But I got pissed, like for real? you think we are racist, yet invite you over to our house, where you have our hospitality and our food/alcohol. In the meanwhile you are getting evidence to ruin our livelihoods? I don't want anyone like that in my house AT ALL. So I make a scene and get her to leave. Kate and Jess say it was just a misunderstanding. I was like no there wasn't ts the principle behind it. Some of our friends have came to Ashley's side but I don't see how you can support her."
147,Not the A-hole,AITA for being mad that my birthday gift was sex?,28105,anhw1b,2225,"On my gf's birthday I gave her a necklace that I spent $400 on.  I wasn't expecting her to spend the same as me, but I was expecting something.Here's how it went down.  After dinner she asked me if I was ready for my gift, I said yes and she started giving me oral.  She doesn't like giving oral and I'm ok with it.  She was giving bad oral and honestly I just wanted her to stop, then she gets up and pulls me into my room and we have sex.I feel disappointed.   I don't think sex is a gift.  I didn't expect a gift that was equal to what I spent, but I wanted a least something."
148,Not the A-hole,AITA for naming my child the same name that SIL named hers just weeks earlier?,28098,hn91mz,1622,"My SIL has never liked me. She had always tried to one up me. We were both pregnant at the same time. Her due date was 6 days after mine but her girl came early so she gave birth roughly 2 weeks before me. We had already announced our name because MIL wanted to make a blanket with baby's name in it.SIL said their name was a secret. Well turns out they named their daughter the name we chose and announced. She thought she had won and I decided it wasn't worth arguing with her. I gave birth and we simply went ahead with our name choice. It's a generic name like Sara or Anna but it's was also my mum's name which is why we chose it. So technically SIL could have planned for this name all along but I doubt it.Well, she's not happy at all that the two cousins now share a name. I told her tough luck and why did she think we'd change our name?"
149,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my wife that the only reason she says 'money doesn't matter' is because we're rich?,28100,ktuqop,2147,"I (48M) and my wife (47F) both have very well paying jobs. I am a Pediatric Doctor and she's an Attorney, which have allowed us and our kids (20F), (17M) and (15M) to have a more than comfortable lifestyle. My wife has a tendency to say things like 'Money doesn't matter' and that 'material things don't matter' and she says them all the time, which kinda irks me because she's right, but I was raised in a poor family, and I know that she wouldn't be saying the same thing if we were middle-class. But I haven't said anything up until this morning. I had made a comment about needing a better watch, and my wife was saying her usual 'money doesn't matter'. I told her that she was only saying that because we are rich and because she has never experienced being without money in any sense. Predictably, she got upset with me, and now I'm wondering if perhaps I overreacted and went too far."
150,Not the A-hole,AITA for forcing my tomboy daughter to wear formal clothing?,28060,il24rf,2116,"Hi all. My family is Indian-American, but I like to think I am pretty progressive. I (40F) have a son (16M) and a daughter (15F). My daughter has started to become a tomboy over the last 2 years, despises feminine clothing and style. While it has definitely been an adjustment in my perception, I have always tried to be as supportive as possible, and have let her pick her own clothings, only eliminating anything that was graphic or inappropriate.However, my niece was getting married in a traditional, big Indian wedding. While generally all the girls would be wearing formal lehangas (Indian traditional dresses), I dropped it after asking my daughter if she wanted to wear that and she said no (only mentioned it once because she really looks up to my niece and I did not want her to feel left out). When I asked her what she wanted to wear, she said that should wear a t-shirt and slacks.But, I insisted that she wear a formal clothing of her choice, whether it was a suit, a dress or traditional indian clothing. This was black tie event. I was making my son wear a formal suit. Everyone was going to be dressed to the nines. I was going to get my son a new suit tailored for the event, and I insisted that she come with and pick a fabric and suit style as well. It could be to her desire (as long as it was appropriate) like a very typical men's suit or feminine twist like what Zendaya wears.She got angry and said I was constricting her expression. I think she will have to wear formal clothing in other points in her life, whether for work or other formal events. She can express herself however she wants but dressing appropriately for the occasion is a necessary skill. The wedding has been postponed for now, but I still want her to wear a formal outfit and she is still mad at me about this. AITA?EDIT: Wow, I did not expect this to blow up like this haha! Thank you for the comments and messages! While some of you have labeled me as the asshole, I think a lot of you are saying that I am not which is good to hear. But, I want to stress that I don't think my daughter is really the asshole (a little right now) but she is the sweetest little girl in the world (I might be biased haha). She is usually  very respectful, gets excellent grades and works really hard. I am very proud of her.Some of you have mentioned there is an underlying problem that I am not seeing. I do not think my daughter is trans, but I think I have made it clear that its okay if she or anyone else is. She also generally seems pretty happy with her body she is actually really fashionable and doesn't really wear baggy clothing or anything, but is more into ""streetwear."" She is the one who showed me who Zendaya is! Are there additional signs I should be looking for or things I should be doing?I think she is at the stage in life where she knows everything, and I, her mom, knows nothing. She wants to rebel for something, but isn't really the type to rebel with something really bad (thank god), so she decided this is a justified area to rebel. She is also at home, and I haven't really allowed her to go out because of the current circumstances so think she feels cooped up and now everything about me is annoying her.That being said, a lot of you said to tell her she can't go to the wedding if she doesn't wear formal clothing, and I may be the asshole here, but SHE IS GOING. That is a thing I have decided to take a hard stance on. (1) because my daughter really, really wants to go! She loves her cousin and my family, and she is a really social person who would love weddings. Telling her not to go would hurt her I think and would be counterproductive in the longterm. (2) This is the first  wedding in our family and the first time my kids will see a traditional Indian wedding. They have never seen one before, so I think its important that they learn and feel connected to our culture. (3) If she decides not to go as an act of rebellion, I know my daughter, and I know she will feel really, really sad afterwards.Parenting is hard, and I was always a girly-girl and so were all the people around me, so this uncharted territory for me. Thank you to all of you for your kind words and encouragement."
151,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling a guy with autism off because he wouldn’t stop talking about something he knows nothing about?,28019,hv5qaz,2469,"I (29f) am three years into my PhD. I have published many papers and been a co author of even more. I've done field studies and teach at a uni. Basically, I know my field.I speak a few langues and teach a group of people outside of work. We meet up once a week and talk in that language. We are all friends and it's very casual. Last week one person of the group asked if they could bring a mate (K) from work who's interested in the language too. She said that her mate is on the spectrum and that he might not know when to stop talking. I said bring him along and we'll see how he fits in.The actual lesson went well and I think we were all happy. Usually some people stick around for a bit after and we just have a few drinks. This is when it started. As it turns out K is interested in my field of study. He asked me some questions and I was happy to answer. But then it started getting weird. He kept arguing with me and ""correcting"" me, telling me what I apparently misunderstood and so on. It was quite awkward and my other friends tried to gently let him know that he was probably out of line. He kept asking me about my opinion on studies and papers but in an aggressive almost questioning way. The last straw was when he told me that I misinterpreted the findings of a study that I was a co author of. I was sick of it and said ""listen buddy, I know you think that you know everything about this field but if you had actually bothered to read who ""et al"" is then you'd know that I wrote this fucking paper so please just shut up"" not my proudest moment I admit but at this point he'd been trying to ""beat me"" for over 30 minutes. He left after that but later messaged me that he'd inform my uni of my discriminatory behaviour towards people with autism.Now I'm wondering if I went too far.Edit typo"
152,Not the A-hole,AITA for giving my son a bill for half his expenses?,28011,iyl5pm,1986,"My son (17) asked me for a new gaming system and I said no because he already has plenty of gaming systems and games and doesn’t need more. If he wants one he can save up and buy one.He then comes to me with a budget on how we can “afford” the system. It was mostly just that if I buy nothing for myself for 2 months, we’ll have enough for the system. I told him hell no, it’s offensive and if he wants the system he has to save up for it.Then he comes back with another budget. He and his father calculated how much I’ve been paid in child support over the years and they decided it would be a good idea to let me know how little a drop in the bucket the gaming system would be. I told him I spend that on his expenses every month but he didn’t believe me, so I told him that if he doesn’t think so, he can pay me for his expenses every month and I’ll give him the child support.Surprise surprise, when I gave him the bill, it showed that when you factor in all of the things I pay for in a month, it’s much more than child support. Child support doesn’t even cover 30%. Now my ex is yelling at me for making our son feel like an expensive burden, but I think I was teaching him a lesson about money and unteaching him some of what my ex says about support. AITA for giving him a bill?ETA: not able to comment, but just wanted to say this isn’t a question of being able to afford the console. I can afford it, but that doesn’t mean he should just get it."

His estate was basically two cash amounts and the other share was his beach home in California. Basically the oldest got to pick which they wanted, the second oldest and the youngest which was me. MI got the beach house, my sister and cousin got $500k. For the last six months I’ve allowed my sister to stay in the house whenever she likes but I just got my first tax bill and I either have to sell it or start making some income off it. After talking to the real estate agent I’ve decided the best course of action is to put it on Airbnb. That way I can still use it if I like, but sister can pay me to use it if she still wants to go there, basically there’s not someone renting full-time. My sister is furious with me for so many reasons, first of all I know she’s upset because she can no longer use the house for free. But she’s also telling me that I basically becoming a rent seeking capitalist who is going to ruin the neighborhood which has been a total classic surf neighborhood since the 1950s. She has written me angry email after angry email after angry email calling me all sorts of names. She also says it’s not fair because her inheritance is gone for her debts but I still make money from mine, and that if she had chose the house I could stay there any time I want.  She’s my older sister and I’ve always been impressionable to the things she says to me and I’m feeling a lot of guilt and shame for what she told me. Am I the asshole here?"
154,Not the A-hole,AITA for being honest with my nephew about where I was for most of his life?,27906,cgq9zs,2195,"Okay, let me just get right into this. I [27M] was kicked out at 16 because my older sister [37F] outed me to my parents as gay. They completely cut off all contact with me and I didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and Mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. When I was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. For the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. A couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and I ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. He asked me why I wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. I asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. I told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until I eventually confessed I was cut off for being gay. He made a face and asked how my parents even found out. I told him I was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that I don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. He got a bit quiet and changed the subject. I got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that I'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by ""pretending they're bad people"" and ""making up false homophobia accusations"". I explained to her that I didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and I think he's old enough to deserve honesty. She just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. I'm crushed because obviously I love the kid. Did I do the wrong thing? Should I have lied or refused to talk about it or lied to him or something?"
155,Not the A-hole,AITA For not punishing my daughter for mocking her cousin?,27884,k2seky,2524,"My wife and her younger sister are best friends. As a result, when our middle daughter and her cousin were born around the same time, my wife really expected them to also be best friends. With sixteen years of hindsight, I can say with certainty that the expectation was misplaced. Nothing happened in particular. My daughter just doesn't like her cousin. My wife keeps pushing the relationship. This includes making my daughter spend time with her cousin during family gatherings, inviting her cousin on trips, forcing my daughter to call her. We're pretty sure I'm the favorite parent (a fact that keeps my ego well-inflated), and, therefore, my apathy towards the situation is not well-received by my wife. From my perspective, this isn't important, and I do not possess the ability to make two teenagers become friends. I'm also pretty sure that trying to push this kind of knuckleheaded stuff makes kids not want to speak to you. This is where I'm probably an asshole. Yesterday, my wife forced my daughter to video call her cousin. My daughter rejected to request, and my wife told her: ""Unless you have a valid reason for disliking your cousin, you will do this because we're family"". The call occurred. This morning, we awoke to a PowerPoint presentation titled *Valid Reasons to Dislike \[Cousin\].* Using clips from the zoom call, segments included *Why is \[Cousin's\] Voice so Grating? A Music Theory Approach, A Case Study: Conversations That Provide No Value*, *Rethinking the Idea That There Are No Dumb Questions*, ect. With the benefit of a couple of hours of hindsight, it was a very cruel takedown of her cousin's entire personality. My wife was furious. My eldest daughter and I lost our shit laughing. My wife is demanding I support her in punishing my daughter for bullying her cousin. I have refused because I feel this is whole situation wouldn't have occurred if she didn't push the relationship, but I'm starting to have second thoughts because it was very mean. AITA?"
156,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking my boyfriend's parents out of our apartment after his mom called me a bitch?,27870,gon4bm,1758,"Back in March his parents decided they wanted to come ""wait quarantine out"" at our apartment. For starters they never asked. His mother called and TOLD me that they were on their way and to prepare our spare bedroom for them. I was already apprehensive about them staying with us because his parents have always been EXTREMELY rude to me. They are overly critical of everything I say and do. They are massive control freaks who feel entitled to always be in charge. So right off the bat things are miserable. They verbally abuse me daily, tell me what I can and can't do in my own apartment, and are overall just the WORST. Out of everything, the air conditioning caused the biggest debacle. Where I live it has been 85-90 almost every day. I normally keep my air on 70, but when they started complaining, I turned the air up to 75. This is already a little toasty for me, but I was willing to be a little hot to try to keep the peace. This was not good enough for them. They don't want the air on. Period. They want the HEAT on. And they turn it on every single opportunity they get. I wake up in the middle of the night covered in sweat. I have told them to stop COUNTLESS times. Yesterday I finally cracked. I put about 10 pieces of duct tape over the thermostat with a note attached that said ""Do NOT touch the thermostat while I am at work"". 6pm I walk into my apartment and am automatically HIT by a hotter and more humid heat than it is OUTSIDE. Duct tape and note have been torn off the thermostat and they have the heat on 98 fucking degrees. I go into the guest room and say ""Why could you not follow the simple instruction of DO NOT TOUCH THE THERMOSTAT. This is my home. I am tired of you saying rude things to me. I am tired of you treating me like a child and creating your own rules for MY apartment. You either need to be respectful towards me and learn to accept my boundaries or go back to your own house."" His mother said and I disdainfully quote, ""You have no right to barge in here without knocking. That was not only an invasion of privacy but you need to take the attitude out of your tone. I've dealt with much bigger bitches than you before."" She went on for 30 minutes and I just tuned her out. When she was done talking I told her to get out. Now my boyfriend is angry with me because I couldn't just let them have their way. He wants me to call his mom and apologize but I don't think I should have to. I may have been rude to her, but it was only because I have spent the past two months dealing with her abuse and trying to politely ask her to stop treating me that way. I got tired of politely asking someone to stop treating me like shit in my own home in which I was letting them live in for free. I also got tired of my boyfriend refusing to defend me and allowing her to say and do whatever she wanted. I am trying to understand their perspective although it just doesn't seem reasonable to me. If Reddit determines I am the asshole, I will call and apologize."
157,Not the A-hole,AITA for not using my daughter's college fund for my stepson's rehab?,27869,kfi8io,2965,"The title basically sums it up, I suppose. My husband and I have been married for three years now, I have a daughter (15F) and he has a son (24M). I am friendly with my stepson, but we aren't close. He has a biological mother who is a perfectly fine woman, I'm not here to take the role of his mom. My late husband (my daughter's father) died when my daughter was 6, we both contributed to her college fund. My daughter's paternal grandparents have also contributed a large amount. Right now, the fund has about $180,000. My daughter is extremely bright, and I'm not just saying that because I'm her mom. I truly believe she has the capacity to go to an Ivy league school, and her teachers have said she has the potential as well, and I don't want costs to hold her back. Our income would be too high to get any meaningful financial aid, and while there are a few merit based scholarships out there that she will be applying too, we don't want to put all our eggs in one basket and hope she gets it when it's so competitive. My current husband and I have separate finances, he doesn't contribute at all to my daughter's fund.My stepson is struggling with a heroin addiction, and has stolen money, jewelry, hierlooms, and electronics from us for drug money. I understand that addiction is a disease, and I personally paid for an outpatient detox for him, which cost $1000, which failed. His father then paid for an outpatient rehab program, which cost $6500, which also didn't work because he barely showed up. He promised us he'd do better next time and he needed another chance, so I split the cost of another $6500 outpatient rehab program with my husband, which seemed to work during program, but he relapsed as soon as he got out of it. I have spent so much money, time, and energy and it hasn't helped at all.My husband and my stepson want to try a 60-day inpatient rehab program, which will cost $30,000. I had absolutely no idea where they were supposed to get the money for that, considering the thousands and thousands of dollars that were already spent, and the fact that we no longer had anything of value in our house. They want to use my daughter's college fund, which to me is absolutely off-limits. I feel like it's completely unfair to my daughter to punish her for my stepson's addiction, unfair to my late husband and his parents, but frankly, I don't think spending $30,000 will work. My husband thinks I'm an asshole because I'm prioritizing my daughter's education over his son's life, and he believes medical needs come first. He then asked my daughter if she'd be willing to use $30,000 from her fund to pay for her stepbrother's rehab, and she got very quiet and did not answer. He then got very upset with her and said she was being selfish. My daughter later told me that she didn't want to give her stepbrother the money, but she felt so guilty, and I am furious at my husband for emotionally guiltripping my daughter like that."
158,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I refused to attend my cousins wedding after she asked me to dye my ginger hair?,27845,ezb2co,2854,"Yes I'm aware that my cousin posted here and oh the irony as i showed her this sub last year, but I really don't care if she sees this,  maybe it'll hammer the point home. And I doubt she will see it as they are currently on their pre wedding honeymoon, legit didn't even know those were a thing. So Amy is getting married,  she has a blue and green and purple theme for the wedding. People are supposed to wear these colours including the moh and the bridesmaids. What irked me about that post was that my hair is NOT FLAMING MERIDA RED.maybe slightly more [ginger] ( in low lightThis whole thing is completely insane to me and I have no idea where it has come from.My [hair]( [2]( [3]( is what i would describe as strawberry blonde, maybe ginger blonde. Those are actual picture's of my hair not some poor stranger's instagram.Things have been awkward from the start with Amy demanding that everyone has to stick to this dress code or they will be barred by security at the damn door.She has also asked anyone with hair past their waist to cut it in a Facebook post but it got no replies and I can't think of anyone except me and maybe my sister with suoer long hair.My mum and dad are both way more ginger than me and my sister who is 8 months pregnants hair is not much shorter than mine and is super ginger, and Amy never asked her to touch her hair? if anything I got the dull hair geane.At first Amy called up to tell me she had made a post here,  I took a look and had to laugh to be honest,  She linked me early on clealry thinking people would agree with her but she said she was worried because it blew up. After things went south she decided to try and ""negotiate"" with me, still completely bizzare as my hair is not merida red.My mum and dad called round a few days back to talk about it but got absolutely nowhere with her as she's still insisting i dye my hair a dark brown for the day or get a wig. My aunt,  Amy's mom called to apologise to me and asked me to please come but I don't feel welcome, can you imagine attending a wedding where the bride stares daggers at you the whole time? and what if the security refuse to let me in. [these]( are extremely similar to the gowns the bridesmaids are going to wear, I've tired mine on and it absolutely dose not clash at all.I brought and paid for my dress so I don't owe her anything but our families are so upset that I'm dropping out. But if I go I have no choice except to dye my hair as there never was a compromise or middle ground,  it was dye it,  buy a short brown bob wig or don't come. She specified it has to be a short brown bob wig for some reason.WIBTA if I just say fuck it and stay home.EDIT  also to be fair i dyed a small strand underneath to test how it washed out 4 weeks ago, it is STILL DARK BROWN"
159,Not the A-hole,AITA for walking out after a boss tried to refuse to accept my resignation?,27844,j5o8e8,1561,"I had a boss who was a real turd. He labored under the delusion he was an excellent boss and couldn’t put together that his behavior and the crappy pay was why he had such a hard time keeping employees. He also thought it was acceptable to call his female employees hun, sweetie, and sugar. He was a condescending asswipe who consistently passed over more qualified women for promotions in favor of promoting less qualified men. I had to stay until I could find a better job because I enjoy eating, and couldn’t afford to leave unless I had something else. I got an interview with a competitor who hired me on making more than I made with him. I turned in my two weeks and he said “oh sweetie, you know you can’t leave.” I said I absolutely am leaving. He got the smuggest look on his face and said “Well, I’m not accepting this, sugar. Guess you’re here to stay.” I got so furious and decided that was it. I said “well screw this then, I quit. Effective immediately.” Called my new job, explained what happened in front of him as he sat there slack jawed and agreed start the next day. I packed my stuff and left. A former coworker said it was an asshole thing for me to just up and quit on the spot, but if he refused to accept the resignation he could easily have tried to screw me over when my last day did come. My new boss says he deserved it and I’m not the asshole for quitting like I did. My boyfriend says he can see how other employees might feel like I was an asshole by making them cover my absence, but sees how I’m not the asshole for walking out of that toxic environment. So just because I’m curious, I thought I’d ask here. AITA?"
160,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not allowing my ""disabled"" neighbor to park in my driveway and getting her car towed, despite the previous owner allowing it?",27836,j21f5l,3748,"I bought a house a few months ago and moved in last month. The previous owner was a friendly old man that could no longer live alone so he decided to sell and move in with his daughter. Just to be clear I put disabled in quotation marks because the lady in question is just really really overweight and I am not sure if that counts as disabled.Now apparantly he had been allowing use of his driveway to his ""disabled"" neighbor lady largely because street parking is extremely limited and what little street parking there is, is pretty much instantly occupied. What I am saying is unless you have a driveway you end up having to park a good 5 minute walk away and that's the best case scenario.Obviously I was unaware of this so I was surprised to see a large SUV parked in my driveway when I moved in. I ended up having to knock on several doors asking who's car it was because the movers could not stand still on the busy road too long. I figured out it was the neighbors car so after a good 10 minutes of knocking an extremely angry enormous lady opened the door. I told her to move the car and she immediatly started arguing that the neighbor said it was fine, I told her he moved out, I moved in and no it is not fine and to move it because the movers need to unload my stuff. She begrudgingly did, I ended up seeing her walking back  half an hour later completely wet with sweat.Now a few days later I went back to work and lo and behold, the SUV is parked in my driveway again. I go over there again, spend 20 minutes knocking on the door before this lady opens the door, agaon, visibly angry. I tell her to move her car, my driveway is not public parking. She protests saying her ankles can't take walking the distance and claims I can easily walk, I tell her that while that might be true, it's my goddamn driveway and I want to park there myself. Again she moves her car, again I spot her half an hour later drenched in sweat making her way home.Well it happened again a week ago and this time she would not open her door, I got tired of it and had her SUV towed. She of course came to my house to scream at me, I told her to get the hell of off my property. A few days later I had a small fence installed with a lock on it to make sure it did not happen again.I have since been getting dirty looks from her and one other neighbor and when I told my mom she told me I should be nicer to people. I do feel sort of bad too, she clearly struggles with the walk after all."
161,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my mom to not have any more kids?,27829,g95klk,1882,"   I(16F) live with my parents and 11 siblings. I'm the 4th kid, and the ages range from 20 to 1. We live in a 4 bedroom house, but it is so cramped with everyone in bunks and no privacy. My parents also put most of the responsibility of the younger kids on us while they lay down and watch TV. True, they can have their breaks but they take them so often that I don't really get to be a teenager.    Last night, after my mom told me to but J+A(3) to bed, I told her to do it herself as I need to study. She said that it is my responsibility as an older child. I lost my temper and told her that she can't take care of her 12 kids as it is, and that she should give up her dream of 15 children because she’s depriving the younger ones of a better life. AITA?TLDR My mom has 12 kids and wants 15, and I lost my temper and said that she shouldn’t have any more because she can’t take care of all of them as it is."
162,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my drywall guy to stop bugging my babysitter?,27827,hip54w,2215,"We are doing some house renovations and so workers are in the house. Today two guys were putting up drywall in the living room while our babysitter is playing with our daughter in the family room while I’m working in my downstairs office. I hear the drywall guy asking personal questions to my babysitter until her answers started getting short and her tone changes. IE: Guy: So where do you live ? Her: North of hereGuy: Yeah but where?Her: It’s kind of a weird spotThat’s when I finally walked upstairs and told him, “What is this? The census? She’s watching my kid. Let her be. “ I thought I did it in a joking manner but I guess it came off harsher than I intended. My wife promptly informed me I was an asshole to the guy and the babysitter had it under control. I get that white knighting is a thing and that I may be out of touch with where I should be putting my foot down so I leave the verdict all of you. Am I the A-hole?Update: We spoke about the situation at just before she left. I apologized to her for the weirdo and let her know he won’t be back. To quote her, “The thirsty ones never get the hint.”The most eye opening take away from this  was when she told my wife and I, “If you think that was bad you should check out my DM’s”. Her instagram messages are from people who should be put on the sex offender registry. Guys offering her $700 a week to hold them, guys she has never met offering to buy her plane tickets, and straight up dick pics. How are dick pic people not out on the sex offender registry? It’s just street flashing with less effort. It’s insane and it’s apparently just a norm with the way she brushed it off. My wife is deflecting from whether I’m still the a-hole but I’ll take what I can get. In her defense, even the babysitter noted that while my comment was funny, my tone was actually straight up yelling at the guy. It’s a give and take like anything in this world. Anyway, thank you all for your input and here is to hoping the “thirsty” ones get a job which has them work from home and off social media."
163,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking out my dad and his pregnant wife out of the home I legally own after they sent my depressed sister to live with our aunt?,27747,fiq5ta,1475,"My mother passed away 3 years ago. The family home, where I and my sister grew up, was willed to me. It was her ancestral property, and she wanted her daughter to have it. The other vacation home went to my 16 year old sister.Our father remarried 6 months after mom passed away and moved his new wife in. My sister says that that woman has removed all of our family pictures from the main living area. She has removed our mom's pictures as well. Now all of these pictures adorn the walls of my sister's room.Recently our father and his wife announced that they were pregnant with twins. My sister didn't take it well. She's still not over mom's death and had a breakdown after the announcement.The night of my sister's 16th birthday party, she brought a lot of friends over and the party went on till the next morning.My dad's wife, who was out with our father on vacation returned the same morning and lost her cool when she saw the kids passed out on the living room. Our dad knew about the party, they just got home earlier than expected.His wife proceeded to lose her cool and had a big shouting match with my sister. She said that my sister was just like our mom and was a burden on our dad. She then asked her to leave and sent her packing to our aunt's.I was furious when I got to know about it. I showed up home the next day and asked them to leave within a week. She's 7 months pregnant and had no idea that the house belonged to me. I know I shouldn't be kicking a pregnant woman out but I don't want my spineless father and his wife to abuse my sister anymore.My father called me a cruel brat and now wants to challenge our mom's will. He can try, my mom's family has already appointed their family lawyer to fight my case.AITA?"
164,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking my girlfriend out of my place on New Year’s Eve for scaring my little brother?,27711,kok683,2672,"We can all agree 2020 was a shit year. Particularly for my (29m) family. We lost our dad beginning of the year after he had a heart attack and my little brother (12) had no one to take care of him. Our mom died when he was 3 so our dad was all we had left.  I fought for custody and was appointed his legal guardian.Honestly it hasn’t been easy. We’re still adjusting to these life changes and my brother is taking it the hardest. For months he was just not himself. Bad attitude, lashing out. I got him in therapy because I knew he was just hurting, plus stress of pandemic.His behavior has improved so much since then, even if sometimes there’s days where he’s withdrawn.Days before Christmas he was feeling sad since it was our first holiday w/o dad. That day, he asked to be left alone. We had a talk to discuss his feelings and I gave him his space after that.My girlfriend was over that day and I went out to buy groceries. When I got back my brother was out of his room and helping out. I didn’t think anything of it at the time.Yesterday my brother and I were out having some guy time before going back home to get ready for NYE. My brother opened up about how grateful he is for everything and he hopes that I don’t change my mind about taking care of him. I asked why he’d think that and he told me what happened.That day when I was out my GF went to his room to tell him he needs to change his attitude and stop moping (her exact words)because he should be grateful I’m taking care of him at all. And that we can still hand him over to the state if we wanted to. I was furious about this and had to reassure him that was never gonna happen because he really was worried about it. We went home, I confronted my GF and she didn’t deny it. She told me it’s true and there was nothing wrong with telling him to stop acting like that when he should be grateful I “gave up my life” to take care of him. And the thing about giving him up isn’t that big of a deal to her because it’s not like I’ll actually do it.I said she still scared him with that threat and told her to leave my apartment because honestly, I was far too mad and because I didn’t want her to be near him right now. She started crying, there was more fighting but she left in the end. It was just me and my brother for New Years.Since last night I’ve been bombarded with calls from all our friends for kicking her out knowing she has no family and nobody else to spend the holiday with. Everyone has sided with her and even my best friend says I may have overreacted by making her leave when she probably thought she was helping. They’ve heard my side of the story but still think I was an ass for making her cry and spending the new year alone. I’m having trouble seeing how I could be so here I am looking for internet strangers to weigh in on this.UPDATE: OK wow this has gotten a TON of feedback. Thanks everyone for your kind and encouraging words. I might not have replied to a lot of the comments that made me smile but just know that I read an appreciate them! I know I only posted this a few hours ago but I’ve had a day to clear my head and really think about this. I talked to my brother because I wanted to know if she’s said anything else to him. Thankfully she hasn’t and we had another serious chat to remind him everything she told him is completely false. I would never in a million years give him up and that shouldn’t have been put in his head. Another thing I told him was that I’m grateful he’s here with me. Without him I wouldn’t have made it through the year and I thanked him for giving me that strength to keep going. Someone who DM’d me suggested reassuring him that he’s not somehow “ruining” my life incase he feels any guilt for what she told him. Thank you for that suggestion!Now, I know you were all waiting on this news. Yes, I did break up with her. Thinking about what a lot of you said, talking to my brother about how this made him feel, and my own thoughts about how badly she acted, I decided that’s not someone I want around me or him. I can’t risk her doing something like this again and ruining any progress he makes in therapy. I know many of you think I should’ve done it on the spot, but I wanted to make this decision with a clear head and not when my emotions were extremely high. She came by my place earlier and we talked outside. Her reaction was as bad as you’d expect and she STILL believed she did nothing wrong, even after I explained it all to her. There was just no making her understand and I told her it was over. I gave her a couple of her things that were lying around my apartment and she left. My phone started going off like an hour later so I had to put it on Do Not Disturb. That’s all the drama I could handle for one night. I’ll deal with my friends some other time. Honestly, I’m exhausted. Mentally and emotionally drained right now. I think this weekend we’ll do something  to get our minds off this. I definitely need it after everything and I know my brother does too. It’s been a hard year already without all this extra drama. Anyways sorry for the really long update you guys but I didn’t want to leave anyone hanging. I’m sure more comments will keep coming. I probably won’t be sleeping much tonight so I’ll keep my mind busy by reading and replying to more of you. Thanks again for the support! What a shitty way to start the new year but here’s hoping for better things :)"
165,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my grandparents about my stepsiblings destroying my jewelry?,27710,i1hgsb,1798,"My mother died when I was 10. My father married a goyishe woman less than a year later, who promptly did her best to have as many children as she could, and had 3 in as many years. She has two older kids too, who are 8 and 7 now. 6 kids is a lot, but it's a pretty big house. I'm the only grandchild on my mother's side, and the only granddaughter on either side. My grandparents typically gift me jewelry, and I got my mother's collection when she died. As a religious custom, we don't really do costume jewelry. All of my jewelry is real and not cheap. It sounds vulgar, but my entire jewelry collection is worth about 100k easily. I came home from seeing a friend and the oldest three had a PILE of my jewelry on the floor of their playroom. They had been jumping on it, smashing it and shooting at it with BB guns (yeah, my father allows that apparently). I screamed and got my father, who came with his wife and dismissed the entire thing.  They destroyed multiple pieces, several of which were heirloom. My stepmother didn't really care. She pretended to yell at her brats. She later came home with a dollar store necklace that she ""made"" the kids get me and said that that should be enough and that I shouldn't have such ""idols"" or wear such ""sacrilegious crap"" (one of my necklaces is a star of david). I saw red at that. I got her to repeat it so I could record it. I emailed all of my grandparents, aunts and uncles detailing what happened, attaching the recording and pictures of the damage, and then I went to those brats' playroom and destroyed one of each of their favorite toys. My grandparents are now suing my stepmother for $50,000 and half of my family now hates her. My father is furious and thinks that I should have kept it within the family and let him ""work it out""."

Our classrooms judge was a mom who in the school board and when we were doing the presentations she was showing really obvious favoritism to her daughter's best friend who i know is tight with that family. I know her presentation wasn't even her own, it was plagarized a lot and not very good, I saw her doing it in the computer lab days earlier.It was annoying how the ""outside judge""kept going back to coo over this one presentation even after everyone had moved on and other people had presented. It was super awkward, like she was praising this one girl after a different kid had just presented?? Like maybe pay attention to the person who's at the podium, not your little favorite??It was my turn but I'd already seen her phoning it in when watching the last few, playing on her phone even! Not paying attention. I felt like it was pretty obvious she'd already decided who would would win. And that frustrated me, I'd worked really hard on mine and if her behavior is in the last few presentations was gonna continue, I knew she wouldn't even be listening.So I went up and said ""Look, we all know you already know who you're gonna give the prize to, we've all seen you play on your phone and ignore everyone who came after your daughters best friend, so can we just cut the crap and go home? I'm not gonna stand up here and give a presentation to someone who's disrespecting our efforts and playing on their phone when anyone who's not a friend of your family is talking.""She sure paid attention then, and went to talk to my teacher in a whisper. My teacher sent me to the principal's office. The girl I expected to win, won... No surprise there. But I felt good I'd at least said something. A bunch of my friends in class said I was totally right when I called out that BS, and we all knew it, I wasn't saying anything we didn't all see.My principal kept telling me that it didn't seem like I was taking my college apps seriously and I said that I didn't think I'd be going to college, I got stuck with debt already and I'm gonna need a job right away this spring. Anyway I got detentionAITA for saying what I did instead of doing my final presentation for the project?Edit - I just found out that the girl who got the scholarship money decided to decline it and give it to the student who had the best grade in the class. I don't know if it was because I called stuff out and she felt guilty, but I think it might be."
167,Not the A-hole,"AITA for calling my body-positive co-worker ""unhealthy, deluded, and bitter"" after some rude comments she made about me?",27625,d31cjt,371,"I'm currently working part-time at a restaurant on my university's campus. I mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'Anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. She embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. Personally, I have nothing against this at all. I am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. However, I do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. I don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  However, despite being a ""supporter,"" Anna regularly comments on my body type. For example, I always bring food for my shifts since I personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). Anna will often say things like, ""You should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!"" or ""You look skinnier than last week. I told you to stop eating salads everyday haha."" She'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if I was ""struggling with my weight"" and then proceed to tell me that I look ""way too skinny to be healthy."" One time I was changing into my work shirt in the back and Anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to ""look like a man's."" I have no idea what that even means but I doubt it was a compliment.These hypocritical comments have pissed me off. I enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and I enjoy working out and staying toned. Anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. I don't think this is healthy. Finally, during yesterday's shift, this guy I kinda like came in to get some food and I was super excited to see him. He turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. Oh well. Anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, ""Maybe he's into curvier girls."" I basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. I asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. Then I told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (I called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. She called me insecure and told me I was being a rude bitch. It was reaching the end of our shift so I clocked out early and left so I didn't have to argue with her more. I was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. She said that I was right and all but that I was insensitive in the way I brought it up and suggested that I apologize. I'm standing my ground but want to hear other opinions as well."
168,Not the A-hole,AITA for giving away my grandparents’ gift intended for my fiancé,27615,klazu5,2274,"Every year, my grandparents give $300 to their single grandchildren and $500 to their married grandchildren, along with a note that says “to share with your spouse”. When opening up our gifts this year, I noticed my cousin, who had recently married his gay boyfriend, only received $300 while my fiancé and I received $500. I handed two hundreds from my envelope to my cousin in front of everyone, which caused quite the scene. My family is very religious and refuse to accept gay marriage as legitimate. They refuse to acknowledge his husband as a member of our family and tell him he is going to hell unless he changes his lifestyle. I defended my decision by saying, “we’re not married yet, and they are. I think there’s been a mistake”. Conversations quickly devolved, resulting in both my cousin and I leaving shortly after. My family insights it was not my money to give and my actions disrespected both my grandparents and my fiancé. My fiancé feels my family was welcoming her, and I rejected her in front of everyone. AITA?UPDATE: Cousin is taking us out to NYE dinner with their $200!"
169,Not the A-hole,"AITA for buying a $50,000 guitar for $4,000 and refusing to sell it back when the buyer found out the real value?",27601,ftum7d,5813,"This happened a while back. My wife and I still talk about it every once in a while. She's on my side and most of our friends and family are. However when it happened it was like WW3 between us and her co-workers and others.Here we go...I've been playing the guitar for 22 years. I know guitar values and whatnot very well. I'm very into the guitar market. At my wife's old company she was hanging out with co-workers one day after work and she mentioned that I play guitar. A co-worker who I guess is very popular at work said that his dad passed away and he was selling his dads things. His dad had a guitar and asked my wife if I'd be interested in it. My wife texted me and I said to have him send me the info on the guitar and the price. The next day he texted me the pics and price. It was a 1952 Telecaster in mint condition. He had the original receipts which was crazy! (That's how I knew the date). I asked what he wanted for it and he said he ""looked up Telecasters online and he thinks $4,000 is fair"". I texted back, ""I'll take it for $4,000"" and went to pick it up. The guitar had no sentimental value to him at all.Here's the issue at hand. The guitar was/is worth approximately $50,000 depending on the buyer and I knew it. When I got the guitar I told my wife the price and what it was worth. She was floored. Fast forward two weeks her co-worker tells my wife he just found out what the guitar was actually worth from a family friend and wanted it back. She said, ""well he really likes the guitar and he knew it was worth $50,000 which is why he was floored you offered it to him for $4,000. He really likes it and I doubt he will sell it back, but you can ask."" (Probably not the smartest thing for her to say, but she was caught off guard and it's not her fault or problem). He contacted me and asked to buy it back. I said that it's not for sale. He then said I scammed him and he was going to ""sue me and take my wife to HR for being a part of the scam."" Which was nuts, but he actually did contact HR. They were cool about it and said it's not their problem. It's between him and me. Over the next few months he made things very uncomfortable for my wife at work. He would bug her constantly about it. She eventually had to go to HR for harassment and they actually let him go (She complained twice and he was warned and didn't stop). He's contacted me several times about it so I got a restraining order for harassment too. I blocked him too. I haven't heard from him in about a year.AITA?UPDATE: Well this post blew up way beyond what I was expecting. It looks like I was voted Not The Asshole. There's over 5000 comments. I couldn't read them all, but I did read a lot. Just to clear up some things. I left somethings out because I didn't want it to influence opinions and really wanted it to be about me buying a guitar at significantly lower market value vs the people in the story. I did include the fact that the guy was harassing my wife at work not to make the guy sound bad, but because I thought it was relevant to the story. Here's some specific details I chose not to include:The guy and his dad were not close at all. So those people saying he was grieving and I took advantage of him, that is 100% not the case. When I went to get the guitar he was telling me he hadn't talked to his dad in six years and was actually annoyed he had to deal with a funeral.The dad bought the guitar new and never played it. Luckily it was stored in a closet and not in a basement or attic. There's no issue with the wood or electronics. It plays like a dream and I couldn't be happier. I am not selling the guitar to the son or anyone. It will be with me for a long time. I'm in my 30's so maybe in 30 years it will find a new home.I would have MAYBE considered giving the guy more money or giving him one of my guitars to sell on his own, but I decided not to do that after he left a terrible voicemail on my phone the day he found out the real value. He demanded it back like he was entitled to an object he sold fair and square, called me a POS, called my wife a POS and said he would ""do bad things"" if I didn't sell him the guitar back.And to those people who say they would have told the guy the real value. That's a load of horse shit. If you went to a garage sale/estate sale and saw an item worth $5000 priced at $50 there's not a snowballs chance in hell you would walk up to the homeowner and tell them they mis-priced it. You'd buy the item and then tell all your friends and family what a great score you got! Don't even kid yourself like you wouldn't do that. I don't feel bad about buying an awesome guitar at a steal of a price. I was curios what others would think and it looks like I'm not the asshole so thank you reddit. I can play the guitar with zero guilt now. Not like I felt guilty before, but now my feelings are justified."
170,Not the A-hole,AITA for going no-contact with my parents after learning they had lied to me about my allergies all my life?,27561,h808dd,2230,"Hey everyone. I am 19 years old and my parents are in their 50s.For as long as I can remember, I have been allergic to several things:* Dairy* Wheat/Flour/Gluten* LegumesSince I was a young child, my parents have completely kept all of them out of our house. While other kids ate breakfast cereals, I ate fish and assorted pickled vegetables for breakfast. While other kids had Lunchables, I had grilled chicken or fish with, again, assorted vegetables (usually sweet potatoes). While other kids ate birthday cake at the birthday party, I had an apple. I never questioned this until a couple of months ago. I was at my aunt's house for my birthday party, and she made brownies for everyone. For me, she took great steps to make them with almond flour and avoided all of my allergies. I started eating them and thought little of it until my aunt suddenly looked at me and, in a panicked way, asked which plate I took the brownies from. I pointed from the one where I got my brownies, and she immediately stood up and told me we had to get my EpiPen. She raced to ask my mother for it, and I sat there scared out of my mind because I had never mistakenly eaten flour before.I noticed my mother had calmed her down, and then she said that we don't have to worry because she had switched the plates of brownies, and after all I had eaten the ones made with almond flour. I found this incredibly odd because, really, why would she swap the plates? That doesn't even make sense. But for the time being I let the issue rest.It didn't sit well with me for about a week and I finally went to get an allergy test. The doctor started with a skin prick test, and lo and behold, I didn't react to any of the above substances. Then he ordered a blood test, and when the results came in, they said that I had absolutely no intolerance to any of the foods I'm supposed to be allergic to.I was furious and called my mother. She eventually admitted that she lied to me because she wanted me to be on a paleolithic diet, and wanted me to be able to avoid all temptations. She raised me with a lie about her own health, but she keeps insisting that I try to see it from her perspective. She spams my phone with messages about how healthy I am--that I never had acne, that I have been in great shape my whole life, that I have strong teeth and bones, and even that I got onto a D1 college tennis team. She has started calling me ungrateful for her intervention and insisting that I really should be glad I never got ""carb addicted."" I don't know what to think. I carried around an EpiPen for all those years--one that I suspect may be fake seeing as my mother never got me to replace it--and I don't even know anymore.Am I the asshole and an ungrateful son for losing it over this?"
171,Not the A-hole,AITA for changing my name? my parents named me Qur'stylle (Chrystal)?,27541,g1bn71,2589,"So my asshole scumbag parents named me Qur'stylle and my whole life i have gotten shit like ""are you muslim"" ""what language is your name originated from?"" ""what country are you from"" and people butchering its pronunciation, for obvious reasons. I have always told people to just spell it as Chrystal and my parents (mainly mom) would take huge offense to it and would email my teachers every year to make sure they pronounce my name correctly. My mom even grounded me once because I told people to just make save my name as Chrystal in their contacts. Now that I'm a legal adult i got my named changed to Chrystal so now i don't have to deal with this fuckign bullshit for the rest of my life. Having this bullshit spelling and having to correct everyone everyday was annoying as hell and everyone before they met me would always think I'm some spoiled brat bitch when that isn't true at all. Your name affects how people see you, much of it is subconscious, and having these bullshit spellings is not good. My mom lost her shit and started crying and threatened to cut me off for doing this. She said i betrayed her and our family by doing this. Im pretty sure I'm in the right but i need a sanity check here. I told my mom to go fuck herself and fuck her for causing me all these problems in my life and not supporting me and taking my complaints into considerations over my own fuckign name. My mom is a cunt and my dad is a spineless coward."
172,Not the A-hole,AITA? My husband won’t let me sleep.,27465,hjc6zy,1724,"Ok, so I work 12 to 16 hour shifts at an extremely labor intensive job that requires the use of heavy machinery. My job is dangerous and I need to stay focused while at work. This part is important. So, my husband has a friend who is a truck driver. His friend calls at odd hours every night. (Usually between 1am and 4am.) My husband always accepts these calls and then proceeds to have very loud, very long conversations right next to me which inevitably wakes me up and keeps me awake. I have asked him firmly, but politely, to either take the calls at a later hour, or to leave the room while he talks so that my sleep is not disturbed. He refuses to do this, and says that he has to answer the calls to help keep his friend awake while he is on the road. I understand wanting to help a friend, but I do not understand needing to keep me awake while doing it. So, for the last week, I have been locking myself in the guest bedroom and sleeping on the guest bed when I have a shift scheduled. Now my husband is angry and says that it hurts his feelings that I am no longer sleeping next to him every night. AITA?"
173,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my roommate that the name she chose for her baby is ‘ridiculously stupid’?,27463,j0z5qn,2614,"My roommate  (24f) is a big Game of Thrones fan. She’s pregnant with her first child right now. She decided to name her baby, ‘Arya’. When she asked my opinion of this name, I said I it was a good name with a good meaning (Arya means noble in Sanskrit), but a lot of people have named their kids Arya/Khaleesi/Sansa because of the popularity of GoT and it might be a little too common, not that it is a bad thing.The next day, which was yesterday, she said she’s found a way to name her baby ‘Arya’ and not have it be associated with other Aryas running around or the show. How? She said she wanted to spell it as *Aughreighyah*. I did a double take reading that word too, but apparently people are supposed to read it as Augh-reigh-ya or Arya. She asked me how I felt about it and I told her that, frankly, Aughreighyah looks ridiculously stupid and she should just go with Arya. She got kinda upset and said that she and her partner came up with this only because I told them that the name is very common. I said that having a common name is better than having a confusing name.

174,Not the A-hole,"AITA for refusing to share a room with a 1yr old, twin 2yr olds and a 4yr old?",27444,hjkqvx,2077,"So I F(18) was recently invited up to my aunt and uncle’s (I’ll call them aunt and uncle B) ranch house for the 4th of July, and told I could bring a friend. Now, this aunt and uncle have a pretty big house. Their ranch house has four bedrooms with queen beds, the master bedroom, and the “kids room” which is a massive room with about ~6 beds (some bunked), and a loft. They’ve got a lot of land around the house too, so I was excited to get some time to goof off and run around with my friend (also F18). I know that other cousins are going to be there, and assume that my aunt B and uncle B thought beds through and everything like that.The other people invited up to the house were Aunt G and Uncle G and their son M16 who I’ll call F, my Uncle P, and my Aunt and Uncle H.H’s are baby cannons. They have four kids under the age of 5, none of whom sleep through the night (I’ve been to their house before, it’s horrible). Anyway, my friend and I get up to the house and learn that WE are expected to share the big bunk room with the kids under five, while their parents get their own room. Uncle P, cousin F, and Aunt and Uncle G, are also in their own rooms (G’s shared one).I was upset. But, wanting to stay up there, I said okay, my friend and I can sleep on the couch.Cue a MASSIVE explosion.The baby cannons are pissed that I don’t want to sleep in the same room as their children. Their kids are horrible at night, and someone needs to watch them, so it should be me and my friend because I got to invite a friend. I said that if they wanted someone to, cousin F could, but cousin F apparently needed his sleep because he’s a “growing boy” and he “doesn’t know how to take care of kids”.None of the other people in the house wanted to get involved. The aunt and uncle who own the house didn’t care much and just told us to figure it out. So I ignore the baby cannons and set up on the couch with my friend.Cue the baby cannons mother. She throws all of our stuff off of the couches and tells me and my friend that we HAVE to sleep with her kids or we can’t stay. At this point, I’m mortified by her behavior because I have a friend. My friend is embarrassed and doesn’t know what to do.So I tell them I’m leaving.Cue more screaming.I drove up my father’s boat, if I leave, there’s nobody with a truck to drive the boat around, the world is ending.I say that either my friend and I are sleeping on the couch, without the small children, or we’re leaving.Well, baby cannons weren’t okay with that. So, I packed up my stuff, reattached the trailer for the boat, and left.Now I’m getting texts from relatives that I was rude and could have handled it better, and that the baby cannons need a break from their kids and I’m young so I can be a nice family member and deal with it for them. AITA here?UPDATE 7/1 My father has banned the baby cannon from ever going on the boat again. Aunt B is getting involved and is considering asking the baby cannon family to leave for the weekend and to not come back until they can be more considerate of relatives. Uncle B is offering to pay for me and my friend to go on a backpacking trip (my friend and I go a lot), and says that he feels bad for how the baby cannons acted."
175,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling my ex I got pregnant,27416,h83lq5,1898,"I (28 F) was with my ex-husband for about 6 years. During this time, we were trying for a baby but had no success. About 4 years into our marriage, our marriage had a rough patch. My ex had stress had work and slept with his coworker to ‘relieve’ it. He confessed to me rather quick and a week later, they sat me down and told me they were expecting a child. I was an idiot back then and so I felt like I should forgive him because I truly believed he loved me and I thought I had no one.  It wasn’t. My ex’s family treated me like their own, but my ex’s supposed daughter was the apple of their eye. As a result of that, my exs coworker was frequent presence in our lives. They felt like they had to include the mom of their grandchild for everything too and she made her way in every family picture and memory. It didn’t help that I suspected that the coworker had feelings for my ex and flirted with him when she can. People thought that she was my exs wife constantly and I finally had enough when during the baby girls first birthday party when I was told to take a picture of my ex, his mistress, his daughter, and his parents and it didn’t include me. It hit me that I was now treated as the other woman and I realized that I deserved more than this bullshit. I filed for divorce a few months later and left. It was the hardest time of my life but I ended up getting a promotion at work and met this sweet, wonderful guy. Fast forward to now, me and my boyfriend are madly in love and I gave birth to an adorable baby girl that I considered a miracle baby. I got pregnant with my boyfriend like 3 months after dating him and I thought that it was strange that this could happen since my previous failed attempts with ex and had thought that I was the infertile one. It crossed my mind then that maybe he was the infertile one and he only believed mistress was pregnant with his child because they were having an affair. I didn’t say anything though because it was not my place anymore. However, my boyfriend was so happy about my daughters birth and posted it on Facebook and tagged me in the post. I was still friends with my ex SIL on FB and she saw the post. She called me up and said that she was hurt that I didn’t let her know that I could actually get pregnant and the lack of child during my first marriage could be my ex’s fault. He took a paternity test. The poor baby girl was NEVER my ex’s. The coworker apparently was dating this ‘terrible’ guy during the time she slept with my ex and didn’t know who the child’s father was so she just strung my ex along cause she had feelings for him and thought he’d be the best father for her child. Now my ex blames me for not telling him that I was pregnant way before and him having to father this girl. He’s doing pretty bad now and I can’t help but feel guilty like I should’ve told him.EDIT: I didn’t realize that I could edit my post even after the 3000 character limit. Okay so first of all, I keep seeing that people have seen other posts like mine and some youtube video (??). If so, I’m upset that others have had similar situations as me and that some people find the situation so hilarious that they make a video out of it. I’ve also never posted on reddit before (I had a previous account for browsing not posting). I don’t think I have to prove my story and I honestly posted this not to seek validation that my ex supposedly is the worst ever, but to gain perspective since my ex and his family were MY family and close confidantes for a large period of my life. We were pretty close and I had promised to keep in touch after the divorce (which they were super upset about), but I really couldn’t after everything that happened between us. They’re now super pissed at me for the divorce and for being complicit in my ex taking on the expenses of his not-daughter and forming a paternal connection with her for longer than he should’ve. EDIT: So here’s what’s been happening right now, I haven’t spoken to them after this and have been avoiding my ex’s calls. He texted me saying that he is sorry and overreacted and felt guilty about prioritizing ‘people who were never really family’ over me. I only replied with asking how his daughter is because even though she isn’t biologically his, she’s still his girl. She seems like an adorable kiddo and adores her dad :(. My ex‘s mistress is able to support the girl financially so my ex won’t contribute to that but he says that he’s still going to see her every month because he feels morally obligated to. I feel bad for the girl so much because she seems to have lost her family unit (dad, grandparents, cousins)."
176,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my daughter that I absolutely do not support her ONLY wanting to be a Stay-At-Home-Mom?,27377,iunsyq,2541,"I don't have a problem with the idea of parents who stay home with their kids. It's not like that. I get that childcare is expensive, and that often times it just makes sense.What I have a problem with is my teenage daughter literally planning her life to *only* become a SAHM. As in, no college, no jobs, no certifications, nothing at all to support herself until that time might come.I told her that it doesn't have to be college, that not everyone needs college. But that she needs to do *something* to start making money to put away so that, if anything goes wrong with her plan, she has a way to support herself and the potential kids.Her feedback was that her backup plan was me and my husband -- she would move in with us and go from there. We would help them survive. I told her then, what happens if we die, or we're incapacitated? She said ""I don't know, Mom, this is ridiculous, none of it is going to happen.""I told her bluntly that I don't want her becoming Nancy Botwin 2.0, that if something happens, she *needs* to have a backup plan and something behind her other than relying on other people. I emphasized that again, it *does not need to be college*. She can start working retail to learn customer service skills that she can carry onto doing call center work from home if need be. She can start working as a receptionist somewhere, she can do any number of things. But she says no, she's going to plan to be a SAHM.With that all in mind, I asked her, when she graduates high school, what is she going to do? She said ""Just try to find a husband. Maybe marry someone in the military."" I asked her again, in between that time, how is she going to pay her bills? Her rent?She said she assumed she would be living at home.I told her no, and that she would be moving out. She could live at home if she gets a job or tries to get some kind of community college degree or certification. But that if she insists on being a deadbeat loser and waiting for a man to come and rescue her, she's on her own.This didn't go over well, and I am now being held up as totally unreasonable, mean, a huge bitch, etc.I don't think I'm wrong at all. I want to set her up for a lifetime of success and happiness. If this wonderful man who comes and whisks her away, knocks her up, etc, gets injured or dies, I don't want to have her come knocking at our door because she can't afford to take care of herself.AITA?**ETA:** Ohhhh my god, I posted this when I was SUPER agitated and walked away and forgot about it and came back to see all of the responses. Holy shit. Give me a few minutes to catch up. Damn."
177,Not the A-hole,AITA for accidentally calling out a new colleague on lying about her language skills?,27366,logumz,1928,"Last week a new colleague ""Cathy"" (33f) started at my (25f) work place. She instantly stood out in the team, because she seems like someone who is very... loud and assertive? Two of my colleagues, me and Cathy were having coffee in the break room (we were the only ones in there and we were sitting far apart), when the subject of travel was brought up. My colleague said she wasn't booking trips anymore because it'll probably get cancelled because of covid anyway. Cathy, immediately cut in about how sad she is because she travels so often and she goes on these far ""exotic"" trips to Europe as her hobby. When I think exotic I think the Bahamas or something instead of Europe but. Cool.Cathy then jokes about how all this ""no travel business"" is making her fear that she'll lose some of her foreign language skills. I asked what languages she spoke. She claimed to be fluent in 3 European languages, among which were French and Dutch. Cathy said she was ""at a native speaker level"" and went on about how people in Europe were always surprised when they found out she wasn't from there.I was excited, because I never get to speak Dutch over here. I was raised in Belgium, which has three national languages: French and Dutch (which are my mother tongues and the most commonly spoken there) and German. It's quite common to be pretty fluent in at least two out of the three languages in Belgium, because you're required to learn them at school (along with English) from a young age. I told Cathy ""oh leuk, dan hebben we iets gemeenschappelijk!"" (""oh fun, we have something in common then!"")She immediately pulled this sour face and asked me if that was supposed to be Dutch. I said yes. She laughed awkwardly and said she ""couldn't understand because I have a terrible accent and must not be that good at speaking it."" Now see, I don't have an accent. I speak Dutch more fluently than I speak English. I told Cathy that I grew up speaking Dutch and speak it to my family all the time.She got miffed and asked what languages I speak and where I'm from. I told her I'm from Belgium, so I also speak French and I added ""which you just said you speak as well, cool! We can speak French instead!"" I acknowledge that I was a bit of a dick here, because by that point I knew she probably lied about speaking French as well. She then shoved her chair back and angrily got up, said ""whatever"" and stomped off. It was awkward. My other colleagues just kinda shrugged and said she shouldn't have lied.However, she later approached me and told me I embarrassed her by acting ""superior"" about my European heritage. I told her there was no way for me to know she'd lied about speaking those languages. She rolled her eyes and told me I was immature. A colleague told me that Cathy had called me a ""little b-word who enjoys bullying new colleagues"" behind my back later. I don't think I was a bully at all, but I don't want this to turn into a huge thing. Do I just apologize to keep the peace? AITA?\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Edit1: I'm not sure about escalating this to HR, which a lot of people have told me I have to do. I feel like this might make me look immature to the rest of my colleagues (of which I am the youngest) and it might not need to go that far... It depends on if Cathy is willing to put this behind her and be professional. If all else fails I do have ""witnesses"" who would be honest about what happened, so I think I might be in the clear if she tries to twist the story. Edit2: Some people have taken offense to me giving the Bahamas as an example of an ""exotic"" place and are trying to make this into a race issue. I didn't know ""exotic"" was an offensive term in the US. Do I think of The Netherlands, Belgium, England, Norway, which were countries she was describing as being faraway exotic destinations, as my idea of an exotic trip? No. Not because there's a lot of white people there, but because when I think of exotic I think of a place with nice sunny weather, white sand beaches and a blue ocean. Maybe it's because I'm from Belgium, but I don't really feel like being in my home country where it's dark and rainy all the time is quite that experience. Edit3: Some people think she might not have understood me because she is fluent in Dutch, but learned it in the Netherlands, which has different accents. While it is true that The Netherlands and Flandres have different accents, I didn't speak a very specific dialect like West-Flemish or something. I spoke the general Dutch you'd see in the news in Flandres. I didn't speak quickly to try and make it incomprehensible to set her up. I genuinely believed she spoke Dutch because that's what she was saying, so I talked to her in normal, conversational Dutch. The same kind of Dutch I'd use in a work environment back in my home country, the same kind of Dutch I use with friends from The Netherlands. (But with a soft ""g"" lol.) "
178,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my cousin experience motherhood?,27332,idg5xh,3659,"I have a cousin by marriage (husband's cousin) that's 22 and dying of cancer. It was always her dream to marry and be a mom and now that's not going to happen. It's hard on everyone. She has a much older fiance (30) and they had a symbolic wedding so she could have the experience.They started looking for ways to get access to a baby that she could take care of and experience some level of child care that way, but with 2020 and ethics in general, there's not a lot of ways to do that safely. My husband and I have the first and so far only children of our generation, who are 10 months and 23 months old.I had hopes that it wouldn't happen, but her parents asked me if she/they could borrow my younger baby for ""a few weeks"". The cousin and her fiance would basically be playacting having a baby. Her parents would also join in on pretending. There would be photoshoots and everything. This makes me really uncomfortable.It's really creepy. I cannot understate how creepy I think this is. I know that her not getting to live her dreams is sad, but I don't think this is the answer.I'm worried it will be traumatic for my baby. She's almost a year old and will, well, notice that her entire family will just vanish overnight for what will seem like forever. She's also still nursing, and they don't really seem to care about this factor.I'm really worried about problems down the road. This is setting a dangerous precedent of my child living under other guardianship. Her parents will have time to get attached and they could try to use that for familial pressure if not legally. Her fiance is also a wild card in that regard.I said no, and my husband's entire family is hounding us about this because her time is running out and it's time sensitive. They say we're being selfish. They say that we could use this as a free vacation and bond with our older child because I ""popped them out so close together"". They want to compromise now by letting me come by a few times a day to bring milk. We still don't want to do this. AITAEDIT/UPDATE:Yesterday afternoon, we got an email from the cousin's parents offering actual dollar amounts for us to agree. We got enough from that to file a police report and at least get the threat in writing. We also had a call with my husband's parents and his siblings to basically clear the air. Apparently what they were telling people they asked for and what they were actually asking for were very different. Everyone on that call now had them blocked on social media except for MIL (because of the cousin)."
179,Not the A-hole,"AITA for dropping the ""We're Not Having Kids, Now Stop Bringing It Up"" bomb on my MIL?",27255,b5hirx,306," My husband and I don't want kids. My MIL is big into family in the traditional sense. She has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. Literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.My husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. Every time we see her, she asks. Everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said ""We might not even have kids"" and MIL would *not*hear it. At year 4, husband had a vasectomy and I had a tubal.So this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some BBQ and drinks and everything. When I get up to grab a beer, my MIL asks me if maybe I should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.I was annoyed by this and said ""There's really no chance.""MIL, all wide-grin, said, ""Oh come on! It's time for you two to finally get serious! Put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!""I said ""We've been official for about 5 years now, MIL,"" and drink the beer. Husband laughs with me.MIL gets more annoyed and says ""Well, you won't be REAL (Lastnames) until you bless us with babies!""Husband said, ""Mom, enough."" MIL pushed again. Husband repeated.After about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, I finally snapped and said ""MIL, Husband got snipped. I had my tubes tied. We're not having kids. You need to stop bringing it up. Period.""Well, I thought I started WWIII. She started crying and stormed off. Family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. We left. Party kinda ended. The social media bullshit started shortly after. Vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. Some meme about how ""I guess I wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother."" It's obnoxious to the point that I just muted all of them.My MIL finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if Husband and I came over and listened to her reasons that we really ""need"" to have kids. I told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said ""Well then, I guess you two aren't prepared to be REAL (Lastname)s. I'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding."" (It wasn't that much. It was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)I hung up on her. When recounting this to my friends, a few of them said that I was the asshole here for dropping it like that. But I don't think she was ever going to drop it if I didn't finally make a serious, direct comment about it. So AITA?"
180,Not the A-hole,AITA for watching GoT on an airplane?,27205,dxlxxk,4701,"Two days ago, I was on a long-haul flight. I was sitting in an aisle seat. Since I haven't seen Games of Thrones yet, I was looking forward to binge watch the first season. I made myself comfortable and set up my tablet. An hour or two into watching, the woman two rows behind me tipped on my shoulder and told me that I need to turn it off immediately. A little bit confused, I asked why. She told me that her young son could see the show playing on my tablet and it's totally not suited for such young children because of the sex and violence involved in it. While I agree with that, I told her that I'm not going to turn it off. She then basically told me that I am an asshole for not considering other people around me. Is she right?Edit: I want to clarify a few things that were mentioned in the comments:\- I was wearing headphones all the time.\- It was a flight with Swiss from Europe to a city in the United States. The in-flight entertainment system offered various movies and tv shows that were also not suited for children. However I have to admit that probably none was as bad as GoT. However, none of these shows was censored as far as I can tell.\- I'm not sure exactly where (aisle, middle or window) the kid was sitting since it was behind me and I think they switched seats frequently."
181,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my husband he “should have just married a white woman”,27182,iaubc9,3316,"For context I’m a black woman and my husband is white. I have 4c hair and I wrap my hair in a satin scarf to go to bed. For those of you who don’t know what that means, basically my hair curl pattern is really tightly coiled so my hair texture is kinky and easily tangled and easily breakable if not taken care of well. I used to sleep on a satin pillowcase when my hair was shorter and had a lower chance of tangling while I tossed and turned in my sleep. But recently I’ve added oils to my nightly routine and since my hair is a bit pass my shoulders now, the chances of it tangling are higher and I don’t want my pillowcases to get soaked with oils so I started wrapping my hair up again. First night I wore it my husband said that I looked like a slave which- ok was a little bit funny and a little bit true in my scarf and nightgown combo so I let him have that one. But since then, it’s the little comments when I get into bed. Like “are we doing the slave tonight?” Or “should I help you into bed grandma?” Little things like that. I’ve explained why l do it, and I think he understands that but he simply doesn’t like it and my hope was that he’d get used to it by now. Last night I was getting ready for bed and I couldn’t find my scarf anywhere so I asked DH if he’d seen it and he admitted that the hid it but wouldn’t tell me where. He wouldn’t stop joking around even when I got visibly upset and said he wished he could run his fingers through my hair or something along those lines and I snapped and said if he wanted that he should have married a white woman. He got really quiet after that and told me where he hid it. We haven’t talked much about it but there’s this air of awkwardness. The only times he mentioned it was this morning when he said that we should look into counseling for our “race issues” and that I made him feel really racist and I didn’t think about it that way. I thought he was upset because I yelled at him but I didn’t think it was the statement itself (granted I probably should not have brought race into it but I wanted to illustrate a point.) Now he’s suggesting couples counseling to get through our “race issues”? I don’t think it was that serious and I don’t want to go through all that. AITA?"
182,Not the A-hole,AITA For telling my wife her parents are not allowed to ever watch our son again,27180,iycyxr,3133,"My wife and I have a 2-year old son and have been married for 4 years.  Our anniversary was a month ago and we found a nice, secluded cabin on AirBnB and rented it out for a long weekend getaway.  My wife asked her parents if they would be willing to watch our son and they agreed as long as we dropped him off at their house.  That worked for us since it was on our way anyway.I was raised lutheran and my wife was raised catholic, but neither of us currently go to church and have not had our son baptized.  My MIL knows this and hates it. She thinks our son needs to be baptized or he will burn in hell, she's that kind of catholic.  So we go on our trip and when we pick up our son and ask how the weekend went, MIL says everything went fine and that she has saved my son's soul from the devil. I ask her what she meant and she says she had our son baptized that morning at her church. I tried my best to keep my cool so I didn't scream at MIL in front of my son, but I pretty much grabbed my son and left. On the car ride home I was fuming and told my wife as calmly as I could that this would be the last time her parents have our son unsupervised. She tried to downplay what her mom had done but I told her we need to wait until we get home to talk about it because I'm not fighting in front of my kid.When we got home and had a chance to talk about it, things got heated. I told my wife I no longer trust her parents with our son and that if they did something like this behind our backs I can't trust them to respect our wishes as parents in the future. I said this was a huge breach of trust and I will forever look t her mom differently. She continued to try to defend her mom saying that she was only doing what she thought was best for her grandson. She even downplayed it by saying that it's just a little water and a few words and we don't go to church anyway so what does it matter.I told her that under no circumstances will I allow her parents to watch our son by themselves again. I said that we can still let them see their grandson, but only if we are present. I also said that if she doesn't see what the big deal is with this situation, that maybe we aren't on the same page as parents and maybe we need to see a counselor. She started crying and said that this isn't the kind of decision I get to make on my own and I'm an asshole for trying to tell her what kind of relationship her parents can have with our son.I told her that I no longer have any trust or respect for her parents and that I don't know if there's anything they can do to repair that. I told her I don't care if that makes me an asshole, but what her parents did was unforgiveable in my eyes and they put themselves in this position to lose privileges with our son. She's been trying to convince me to change my mind for the last month, but I'm not budging. To me this is a hill I'm willing to die on."
183,Not the A-hole,AITA for being peeved about surprise tooth extractions during neutering,27138,ejkij2,3430,"Today I dropped my dog off to get neutered. He's a six-month Goldendoodle. This was part of a ""puppy package"" of care, which covered all necessary shots and wellness checks, and culminates with neutering and microchipping. I came back a few hours later to pick him up. While receiving the aftercare instructions, I was informed that they pulled a few of my dog's teeth by the vet tech (VT). Our conversation went something like this:VT: The only thing not covered by the puppy package is $20 for the two teeth we removed while he was under anesthesia, so if we can settle this up...Me: Excuse me, you removed teeth? He was here for neutering.VT: His two canines were starting to come in but the baby teeth were not loose so we removed them. It's very standard and what the vet regularly recommends.Me: Well, you did more than recommend it - you went ahead and did it.\*silence\*VT: I'll be right back....now it's important to note that I don't care about the $20 charge. Had I been contacted and told that they recommended this, I would have OF COURSE went with the vet's recommendation! But come on, at least act like I'm involved in the process rather than making me feel like I'm being suckered into a forced up-sell situation. A few minutes later, she came back...VT: I spoke with the doctor and we are going to discount the $20 since we did not consult you first.Me: It's not about the $20. I'm more concerned about the fact that I came here for one procedure, and without any conversation or discussion, you expanded the scope of the visit to include tooth extraction.VT: It was necessary. If we were to have done it at a separate visit, it would have been $250.Me: I'm not concerned about the money if it's necessary. I'm concerned about not knowing about it or approving it beforehand.VT: It's a very routine procedure. We regularly extract teeth while puppies are already under anesthesia.Me: If it's so routine and done so regularly, why was it not discussed at one of the many prior visits or even this morning?VT: You know if we didn't extract the teeth, it could have lead to issues with alignment, bacteria, and other complications.Me: I'm not debating whether the extraction was necessary. I'm upset that I was not consulted first.VT: I'll be right back....this time she brought my puppy back with her. I thanked her and left. To be clear, I was not trying to be rude, difficult, or cheap in any way. But I got into the car with my poor sedated pup feeling like I was being rude, difficult, and cheap. I spoke with a few coworkers after I got back to my office, but I could use some other opinions as well. So, AITA for being peeved about surprise tooth extractions during neutering?\*edit: this has, obviously, gotten way bigger than I had ever thought it would. To anybody that posted on here to vent their spleen and then hit the front page, you know what I mean... that being said, I wanted to offer a few points of clarification because I've seen quite a theme in the comments:1. Most important of all: my puppy is snoozing next to me and seems to be in overall good shape - for that, I'm grateful to the vet.2. It amazes me how many of you post things like ""you're obviously NTA, why would you even post this""... scroll the comments and look at some people on the other side. The reason I posted this is that I was conflicted and was wondering what people thought - and wow, you folks did not let me down.3. I don't plan on talking about who the vet/clinic/hospital is or where it is located. I was not pleased by their customer service, but I am not trying to hurt their business in any way (I will not even post a negative review even though I will be changing providers).4. I'm not upset about the fact that they made a decision that they thought was necessary. I'm upset that they could not explain that decision, or perhaps felt it was unnecessary to explain to me. Please keep in mind that I'm not a vet. I went to school for history and business. If someone had explained things to me, I might have quickly calmed down and the situation deescalated. This would have been best handled, in my opinion, had the vet came to speak to me.5. For the men that are messaging me thinking I am a woman: I'm not.To maybe lighten the mood a little bit, how about a laugh at how silly a Goldendoodle's shaved arm looks? []("
184,Not the A-hole,AITA for flipping out on my sons school after they lied to him about donation prizes?,27048,j6qi9b,2056,"I will try not keep this short with just points rather than description. If INFO is needed, please ask.Son is in 4th grade. School is only open on Mondays. The rest of the week he is home with me. They dont do virtual learning during the rest of the week. No zoom calls are made. No teacher actually checks in. Homework at home is not to be sent back to the school and instead they get a participation grade the following week if they tell their teacher they completed it. Its backwards and your students arent being graded for the work they actually do.Every monday we get a new flier in the mail asking for donations. Last week we got a flier that said to send out 20 emails to individuals to ask them for donations, with the promise of prizes for participation. They also had other prizes on this flier. Basically, the more people who donate using your name, the bigger the prize you get. My son wanted the headphones prize. No where on the flier did it say how many donations was needed. I called the school to ask and they said 12. I sent out the 20 emails. 14 people donated. The donation list was to be emailed to the school with the student ID and we were to pick up the prizes this past Monday. Son was losing his mind excited because he got the 12 donations needed for the headphones. We walk in and they proceed to tell me and my son that he did not qualify for the prize because in order to be eligible, you needed to get those 20 donations. Apparently the prizes for donations started counting AFTER you recieved the 20. They turned damn near every student away, not just my kid.So I sent the boy out with his father and pulled the teacher and principle aside to let them know that I thought it was fucked up that they got these kids hopes up for absolutely nothing and that all they accomplished was destroying the children's spirits by lying to their faces. I then told them that I was told by the secretary that he only needed 12 donations for those headphones. They said ""Sorry you feel that way. This is just how things are right now due to Covid."" So I responded with ""Oh. So lying to students and breaking their spirits is okay because of Covid? Failing to provide virtual learning for the rest of the week like other schools is okay because of Covid? Asking for donations when the kids are only here once a week must be okay too right?"" I then walked out. Well, my son got the headphones in the mail today with a note from the superintendent that said ""I'm very sorry for the actions of the school system and the confusion formed around the donation drive. We are trying to work with the families, not turn them away. Please accept this as an apology."" My son is over the moon. My husband says that I was being a Karen and that we should have just dropped it because it teaches our son that life isnt fair and that I now look like an AH helicopter parent.AITA? I dont think I am."
185,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving the family restaurant and starting my own after finding out I wouldn't inherit it?,27043,gul6fn,2752,"My dad owns a pizza place that was handed down to him from my grandfather.I've been working at the pizza place my while life, even part time while I got a business degree.I found out last early last year that my dad had willed the restaurant to my stepmom. His reasoning being she needs to be taken care of after he dies. And that it would go to me after she died.I was pissed and ""quit"" the next day. My dad ended up hiring two people to make up the work I was doing.Now this is the potential asshole part. A month after I quit, I found a great location where another pizza place had shut down. I bought it and had it up and running in two months. My restaurant is take out only, but my business is doing extremely well. My dad reached out to me last September and said that his restaurant was losing business because of me and to please come back to the family business. He offered to buy my business so I would get something out of it.I declined the offer. Now the craziness of 2020 happened and because my restaurant was already setup for takeout, I'm only seeing a 5-10% drop in revenue.The family restaurant however, is going under.  Now there's a whole lot of arguing about me causing my dad's family to become financially ruined.AITA?"
186,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to return a tip AND telling a couple that I dont have time to play mediator?,27045,j1d4gn,1659,"I'm a 22 year old, female waitress at Texas Roadhouse. This is one of my two jobs to put myself through college. Most days are fine but other days are a living hell.Yesterday I was assigned a table that had a husband, wife and what appeared to be a teenage daughter (maybe 17). Everything was going smooth at first and the wife ordered a margarita. The husband then tried ordering a beer. The wife instantly lost her noodles and said ""Uh, no. He will not have a beer. He will have a water."" She then turned to him and said something along the lines of him not needing to drink because he was driving. He said no, the daughter could drive. It was childish.Anyways, he keeps telling me he wants a beer. She keeps telling me no. In this industry, situations like this are a lose/lose for waitresses. If I get him the beer, wife wont tip. If I dont get him the beer, he wont tip. Damned if I do, damned if I dont. So while they were arguing AT me, I said ""Listen, I really dont have time to play mediator here."" They went silent. I went and got both of them their alcohol. Daughter gives me an apologetic look upon my return, presumably because her mother was acting bat shit crazy upon seeing me bring a beer in tow.Flash forward to after their meals. Husband has had 2 beers at this point. Wife has stopped drinking and glares at me everytime I return. Wife and daughter go to the car while husband pays. Husband drops me a $40 tip on a $68 tab. I told him I couldnt accept it. He insisted. Eventually I pocketed it. Wife comes in an hour or so later demanding that I give her the $40 her husband gave me, stating that I was a terrible host and went against her and I dknt deserve a tip. She got my manager involved who said ""She is not obligated to give you her tip. You left the restaurant and the tip has already been processed. Have a nice night."" She was fuming, screaming at me about how much of an AH I was for supplying her husband alcohol after she said no. Other guests started chiming in saying that she was being ignorant and that I was doing my job, which is to provide guests with what they want and said that it wasnt MY fault that she was a controlling wife. She storms out.Given the fact that I was put on the spot like that, I feel insanely guilty. AITA?"
187,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking out a girl from my daughter's sleepover bday party?,27025,f9m670,2765,"My (34M) daughter (14F) had a sleepover b-day party last saturday, and she invited 5 girls from her school.There was this one girl that she invited who I could tell from her attitude, was a spoiled brat. When she rang the doorbell, she walked in looking down at her phone, didn't greet me or my wife, and handed me her jacket without even looking up.The whole night she was on her phone doing whatever the heck 14 year olds do on phones. I thought she was just embarrassed or shy because maybe she didn't know anyone, but according to my daughter, she is a ""super duper cool girl"".Anyways, towards the end of the night, my daughter was opening her gifts. SB made a comment about every single gift. (not exactly snarky, but more like she was just unimpressed)The final gift was from me and my wife, we bought her an iPhone 7 by pooling all of our remaining extra money to buy her it.the SB scoffed because she had the newest gen iPhone. I helped my daughter set up the phone with a sim card, and the rest of the night they just hung out in her room.My daughter came down a bit later and she was just sitting on the couch, I asked her what was wrong and she just went back up while saying ""why couldn't you have just bought me the newest iphone??"". That was really out of character for her, as she is always grateful for receiving anything.My daughter left the phone on the table. I grabbed my daughter's phone to see a bunch of texts going back and forth between SB and my daughter, they exchanged numbers and the convo went something like this:D ""hey its me""SB ""thanks for inviting me to ur lame slumber party lol, and congrats on the iphone SEVEN haha""D ""what""SB: ""arent u mad that ur parents and friends got u such lame gifts""SB ""slumber parties are for little girls lol, but wtvs its cool""D ""u dont like the party..?""SB ""I jus wish i could go home looool""\~endIt was around 1AM and the girls were still up talking, I knocked and asked if I could speak with SB, she looked confused, I told her she needs to grab her things something came up. (I did this as to not embarrass my daughter in front of her friends).I took her downstairs and asked her to call her mom, she asked why and I said ""because thats what you said right? that you wish you could go home? so go."" She was tearing up a bit, and made the call.I talked w/ her mom for a bit when she came, I showed her the texts and she apologized profusely and said ""its just a teenager phase I guess. I'm so sorry, but dont you think she could stay? If not I understand.""I thought ab it for a bit, but her staying probably would have made it awkward for everyone, so I told her it was best if they just left.My wife said that I overreacted, and I should have just talked with SB rather than immediately kick her out, I firmly believe I taught her a good lesson that she needed to learn. It was MY DAUGHTER's bday, and I didn't want the rest of her night ruined because of some spoiled brat who was making it all about her. I guess she didn't exactly do anything wrong, but at the same time her attitude was unbelievable. AITA?"
188,Not the A-hole,AITA for cutting off my mother when she got a paternity test for my daughter?,26971,hd7upi,3433,"I've been with my wife for 8 years. We have 2 children, a 5 year old daughter and a 2 year old son. I've known since my wife got pregnant that there was a possibility our daughter wasn't my biological child. I don't care. She's my daughter and my wife has never been unfaithful. However, I don't want to know if she is or she isn't biologically related to me, and I've never wanted to know.Edit to include the full story as people are assuming she cheated:  My wife and I were together for around 2 years when we had a fight and broke up. We were broken up for 3 months, during which we both slept with other people, and then we got back together. After approx 2 months of being back together, my wife found out she was pregnant. We knew there was a possibility of one other man being the biological father, and it was a toss up between me and him, but it was more likely to be mine. My wife was honest with me that she'd slept with other people when we got back together, and I was equally honest, and the window of conception for our daughter was just large enough we couldn't say for sure if she was conceived when we were together or apart and while she offered to get our daughter tested, I didn't want to know. My entire family were aware we broke up and got back together.Visibly, she looks like her mother. Same dark hair, same dimples, same bone structure, and I see bits of myself in her, too, mainly in her mannerisms, with the only part that doesn't match up being her eyes, which are brown, while mine are green and my wife's are blue. Meanwhile my son, with his green eyes, blonde hair, and bone structure, looks like I cloned myself, and looks very different to his dark haired, dark eyed sister.My mother has noticed, and remarks on it often. This really gets my wife's hackles up, both because of the reality behind that, which my mother is unaware of, and because she and my mother have clashed a few times in the past. They are very different people, and their personalities just don't mix.Then a few months ago my wife's sister and my best friend (they're married) got into a car accident, they were in the hospital with one of their 3 kids, while the other 2 were home alone, so we asked my mother to watch our kids while we helped them out. Our kids were with her and my dad for about 5 hours.Last week mum came over and said she had something important to tell me. When she had my daughter unsupervised, she did one of those DNA test kits on my daughter, comparing it to her own DNA (which she apparently ordered months ago for this exact purpose and was waiting to use it) and it confirmed my daughter isn't biologically related to me, and she began to tell me about a lawyer she could get me in touch with to begin divorce proceedings. I told her this changes nothing, she's still my daughter and that's my wife she's talking about. Mum was shocked, and called my wife some names I don't care to repeat. I told her to get out of my house.It's been nearly a week. I've told my wife, blocked my mother on everything, and there's been constant calls and texts. My mother is furious I never told her that I had an inkling, and has since disowned my daughter, but says my son is still her ""special little guy"" so she wants a relationship with my son but not my daughter. In addition to my mother, all 5 of my siblings (3 sisters, 2 brothers), and dad are angry with me, they want me to get back in touch, and a couple of them have even said I should thank mum for what she did as she was looking out for me and now I know. However, I can't justify my mother going behind my back to get a DNA test on my daughter without consulting me.I feel I'm in the right, but I also feel I could be overreacting, and I would appreciate another perspective as I'm seriously considering cutting contact with my mother over this.AITA?EDIT: I DO NOT GIVE CONSENT FOR THIS TO BE TURNED INTO A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE"
189,Not the A-hole,"AITA for refusing to babysit my nephew, even in a family medical emergency, because my brother and SIL lied before?",26940,ip8hw1,1804,"I am my brother and SIL’s only relative in the city. When SIL was pregnant I made it clear that I’d only babysit for them in the case of a serious emergency, e.g. someone has a medical emergency. I won’t babysit if they just wanted time off from being parents, because I don’t have the free time for that. I work 60-100 hours a week, so if anyone needs time off, it’s me. Last year, my brother and SIL asked me to babysit on the day of an informal work meeting, a lake retreat organized by my company. Everyone is expected to go, and it’s frowned upon if you miss it. They wanted to go on a date. I said no, I have an important work event. They continued to nag me about how they haven’t gone on a date for so long. The night before that day, they called in a panic and said their friend Mike from the next city over had been in a car accident, and I needed to babysit nephew for a few hours so that they could go visit Mike. I reluctantly agreed, with the stipulation that they’d be back by 7 am the next day to pick nephew up so I could leave for my work event. They did not come back until two days later. I had to cancel on my superiors morning of, which looked awful. My brother and SIL never responded to multiple texts and calls from me. Their excuse was that Mike’s life was in danger and they were too busy helping his girlfriend. I accepted that, since I had met both Mike and his girlfriend at a party in the past and thought they were good people, but I emphasized that this absolutely could not happen again. Throughout the next two months, my brother and SIL regularly used the excuse of aiding Mike in his recovery and needing to visit him in order to make me babysit my nephew.Mike’s girlfriend’s company and my company had a meeting two months after Mike’s “accident”. I ran into her and asked her how Mike was recovering. Apparently, she had no idea he had ever been hospitalized. Neither did Mike. Mike had never been in an accident, and although brother and SIL had gone to visit them recently, it was for drinks and bowling, not bringing them chicken noodle soup in the hospital. I confronted brother and SIL, and they denied at first, but finally admitted they had been lying about Mike’s accident so that they could go on date nights. They claimed I “gave them no choice since I would never help them out when they needed time together because parenting was so stressful and difficult and I had no idea and it was just a little white lie”. I made it clear that after this incident, I would never babysit for them again, and I’ve stuck to that. Yesterday my brother and SIL begged me to babysit for them because there was an actual medical emergency in SIL’s family. They even sent me proof of the relative’s hospitalization. I still said no. They didn’t care about betraying my trust, so I don’t care if they can’t afford childcare or if their relative is in the hospital. They said I was a bad aunt, needed to get over my grudge, and a petty asshole. AITA?"
190,Not the A-hole,AITA for going to my sister’s dream school when she just got rejected?,26889,b84xxt,2491,"[UPDATE](, I got into Cornell last week. Honestly I think it was fluke. I’m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...My twin sister is the opposite of me. She’s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn’t and still don’t mind, it’s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn’t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don’t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). Well last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn’t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. Well anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn’t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I’m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don’t know how but I did. I really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she’s been crying and solemn and sad. She’s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She’s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn’t been herself. I haven’t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn’t get in because she didn’t). Am I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it’s Cornell. I couldn’t in a million years imagine I’d get in. I’ve been researching obsessively about it and I can’t shake the desire that if I don’t go, I’ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it’s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. Am I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don’t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she’s worked compared to me...TLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn’t. She’s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?UPDATE: so everyone here told me that I should go, so I decided to tell my sister. Well, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn’t I tell her earlier and she’s so proud of meBut seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. She went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. Like uncontrollably bawling. I tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...I going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.Update 2: Please let me know if my updates are annoying I only expected 3-4 comments and didn’t know so many people were interested, so I thought least I could do is update So after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. It said:> I’m sorry for how I reacted please don’t be mad. I’m so happy for you and your accomplishments. It’s just that after I got rejected, I at least had the consolation that I get to go to school with you and we can go together. But now you’re going to be where I wanted to be and I’m just so sad. I worked so hard and did everything I could to go to the best school I can and I just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. I’m sorry I’m ranting I just need more timeI’m not going to lie guys, when I read this, I cried. A lot of you are saying that I obviously I have to have attributes that made me desiresble but I really don’t. I don’t deserve my acceptance. I did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest AP classes available, etc. Meanwhile I see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. She deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. I’m really strongly just considering going to NYU with her. Everyone at Cornell will just be just like her and I don’t stand a chance. And I know if I go to Cornell, we’re going to drift apart which would suck because we’re best friends and I just don’t want to lose my sister :(Update 3: So I told my parents and they did NOT react how I would've expected them to. First, they tried to insist that Cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be IMPOSSIBLE if we applied to the same school within Cornell, like we both applied to Arts and Sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. They couldn't have mixed them up). Then they went on to explain how I should go to NYU with my sister. I thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to Cornell if I didn't get in. My sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would I not go to Cornell, and they said how it was unfair that I basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. I don't know if I'm being dramatic, but that hurt. I knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that I don't deserve my spot sucks. Even though they're probably right.I stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. She asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that I 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. My parents were SHOCKED because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. This started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. I'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. I realize that I have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. I'm glad I have my sister actually believe in me.I still don't know if I want to go to NYU or Cornell, mostly because I just don't want to go to school without her. She's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. At the end of the day, I ALWAYS thought the NYU was going to be the school I was going to, so I wouldn't lose much by choosing it over Cornell. I'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. Thanks again everybody for your comments I wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that I got in.Update 3.5: No new news but I just wanted to say that I'm reading every single comment and I apologize if I don't get to you individually and I appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! You guys are amazing :)"
191,Not the A-hole,AITA for using my moms religion against her after insulting my sons hair?,26816,ie1fvh,1591,"I (32F) was raised Mormon but I’m not now, nor do I follow any other religion. My mom is still very much in the cult. As such, she has the typical Mormon mindset regarding gender roles and all that bullshit. Granted, I still think she’d be this way without her religion, though maybe not as bad. We get along splendidly, except when the topic of her religion comes up, which doesn’t often.She’s visiting right now. I don’t see her in person much but she came down for my birthday. It’s also important to note that I have two sons. My 5 year old has a Mohawk. My 3 year old has shaggy, shoulder length hair. He’s never had a haircut for a multitude of reasons, none of which would even be asked if he were a girl. Not long after she got here, she started going in on his hair. This is not the first time she’s given her opinion on it. Why don’t I cut it? Don’t I want to prevent him from being bullied? Or from people thinking he’s a... GIRL??? Because he hasn’t asked and I want it to be his choice. Because he acts like I’m murdering him when I brush his teeth and hair. Because he also flails around like he’s having an exorcism so imagine that with a pair of scissors. Because if someone sees long hair and assumes “girl,” that’s on them and a simple “he’s a boy” corrects it. But mostly it’s because I don’t fucking want to. She got pissed and said what she really thought, which was: “Well I just don’t like long hair on boys.” Clearly. Yet she has no problem with my other sons MOHAWK. Guess that’s boyish enough for her. AND she said it in front of both my sons, which pissed ME off. I said the first thing which came to my head, which was: “If you have a problem with long hair on boys, I suggest you take it up with your lord and savior Jesus Christ. You can start by asking him to get a haircut. Call John the Barber.”Bruh. If looks could kill, I’d be in outer darkness right now. She steeped in her anger for a while but didn’t say anything else. She hasn’t changed her opinion nor will she, but I don’t think she wants to get roasted again either so she won’t bring it up anymore. I feel like we’re both assholes. As much as I hate her religion, that was also a low blow and I have a tendency to speak first, regret later. Though I don’t necessarily regret my words, I do regret how they made her feel. She is my mom after all.Update: Oh my Heavenly Father, I didn’t expect this at all. Thanks for the rewards and honest responses. I’m glad I could make so many of you laugh. I’m here all night. Seriously though, working until 7 am and gonna waste it all reading comments. See you all in the telestial kingdom."
192,Not the A-hole,AITA For Refusing to meet my sister on Christmas after she called CPS?,26804,kebg11,2497," ●I M37 lost my wife of 10 years and it was so devastating for me and my daughter. It's unfortunate but life goes on no matter what happensMy family knows how much I struggle as a single dad and my sister doesn't really get it. She had issues with my late wife in the past but now started ""helping"" with my daughter. She re-decorated my daughter's room without my consent, she'd insist I let my daughter go spend days at her house but my daughter is comfortable at her home. She then started calling my daughter with another name and I'm still trying to understand her logic behind this. I told her to stop doing those things and to be respectful and supportive and she defended herself saying I'm lashing out of grief.I recently. started teaching my daughter to do stuff on her own like brush her hair/clean her room/wash her cups/make sandwiches while I take care of bigger stuff. My sister said that what I'm doing is wrong. That I'm giving her more than she can handle. She's just a kid and although I told her I'm teaching my daughter to be more independent she said that I'm clearly doing this for my own benefits and avoiding responsibility.I got into a fight with her about it. Told her she has zero say in this. And the next day. A CPS Officer came to my house and took a tour around the houseMy first thought was ""maybe he got the wrong house"" until he started reading the report to me saying that I'm never home and that I make my daughter do things that aren't her responsibility, neglecting her education  (btw she's homeschooled) and that I'm not taking care of basic hygiene and whatnot. I told the officer my story and explained that I'm adapting as a single parent and he proceeded to aske my daughter some questions.It was clearly a false report. However I was told that I will have a permanent record with CPS. and I was shaken up by this. I told my family about it and my younger sister told me that my sister was the one who called CPS after we had a big argument. I was so mad I confronted her after she hid herself. Called her immature and stupid to pull this crap (she's in her 40s) and that she's no longer my sister. Then cut contact. It's been months and now my dad started bringing her up knowing how uncomfortable I was. He said that my sister feels sorry for what she did and wanted to talk things out on Christmas dinner.But I said no. He and the others insisted saying that I should be the bigger person. the family will be incomplete without me and my daughter on Christmas. Saying I refuse to be a ""civil adult"" to solve the issue that is dividing the family. I yelled and said that my daughter and I don't have to go after what she did, doesn't matter if she has issues on her own and didn't ""mean it"" and was just concerned. wtf was she so concerned about? They demanded that I at least let my daughter go be with them >>and her auntie << on Christmas.Edit: I don't want my daughter to go and I plan on going to my in-laws instead. I want to talk to her about it and see what she wants to do."
193,Not the A-hole,AITA For walling off my backyard because I dislike 2 kids and depriving everyone else as a result?,26802,hstpcc,1650,"I sure feel like TA but I don't think I am so help me out here.I live in a non English speaking European country and because of history that means land borders between properties are sometimes very weird. Well that is the case with my house and the neighbors, all our houses are about the same size yet out of all the land behind our houses my area is huge I own like 90% of all land there reaching all the way to the woods far behind our houses, meanwhile all my neighbors essentially got tiny strip right behind their houses.Now the part right behind my house is fenced off yet the rest is pretty much open and my wife and daughters like to use it for gardening. The field is used by most of the neighborhood boys to play football on as it is the only flat piece of grassland around they always ask for permission to use it before hand and I always allow it on the condition I get no complaints if I tell them to leave and they don't litter. I also recently had a pool installed to the far back of my property and fenced it off, this is important later.Well this is where the issue starts, recently a new family moved in and they seem to think it is public land. I kept catching their kids running around through the flowers and vegetable garden and they even moved their grill on the field and held a picnic on my land. I keep telling them off and informing it is my land, but they just ignore me and the kids sometimes wont leave when I tell them to. A month ago the kids even climbed over the fence around the pool  and when I got them out and went to their parents they just said ""Oh we figured it was a public pool"", I had hoped that was the end of it yet these people build a fire pit in the 3 days I was away from my house and when I got back I found it with a bunch of empty beer cans around.That was the last straw for me and I hired a company owned by a buddy of mine from when I used to do construction work, bought all the supplies, and 7 days later and a lot of money lighter my entire property was walled off and whenever anyone asked I told them why I was doing that and who they could thank for it.Well now the new family is treated as if they are a pest and all the neighborhood kids are gutted they lost their football field which has resulted in them picking on the new neighbors kidsI honestly feel pretty terrible, but I also feel like I gave them plenty of warnings before taking drastic actions."
194,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my boyfriend name our daughter Renesmae?,26751,lmp6fs,4521,"My boyfriend and I are both 18, and 35w pregnant with our daughter. Since the day I found out we were having a girl he was hell bent on naming her Renesmae, absolutely refuses to compromise. He's a massive twilight fan, I personally hate it and would much rather that we don't name our baby after a fictional character. It kinda hit boiling point last night, for weeks I've been telling him we are coming up with something else becaudr I'm not naming my child that. I went onto Instagram where he had posted a picture of us and said in the caption ""I can't wait to meet you Renesmae.""I got really really mad my this. I told him to delete that, or change the caption because I'm not naming our daughter that. He refused, saying his friends knew now so we had to stick with it. I said ""I haven't fucking agreed to naming our daughter after some stupid made up character from the worst books ever fucking made. Delete the post now or get the fuck out of my house"". He left to spend the night at a friends and my parents who heard the argument said I should just let him name our daughter that, saying it probably means a lot to him and that I'm being an unreasonable asshole. AITA?Edit: Feel the need to add, I have a stutter and can't even say Renesmae out loud, I would much rather name my child something I can say.Stop trying to adopt my child. She is very much loved and wanted."
195,Not the A-hole,AITA for suing my biological father for unpaid child support?,26757,hyowye,1740,"I don't have a relationship with my biological father. He left her when she got pregnant and never acknowledged that he had a child, always saying she was lying. She did prove paternity in court and got an order for child support. At the time at least, he had a job making well over 6 figures that was handed to him by his parents as well as rental properties, so the ordered amount was pretty high. He refused to pay it at all and somehow got away with it. My mother has died and I'm her only child. He's never had a relationship with me, and in this matter, I wanted justice for my mother. While I couldn't independently sue for that back child support, I could essentially sue on behalf of her estate. I won, and he owed me almost $350,000, plus my legal fees. He cried poor, but the judgment was paid almost immediately, so either he was not, or his parents bailed him out.I've seen his wife's social media, and she's posting about ""bastards wanting a payday"" and other tears. Some of my friends and family think that I shouldn't have just used the legal system to get money that wasn't technically mine. AITA?"
196,Not the A-hole,AITA for moving out mid-lease and stranding my roommate with full rent after his girlfriend keeps accusing me of being “creepy”?,26745,ifk8n6,2315,"So I’ve been living with my current roommate for 2 years now. I’m actually subletting and I’m on my 2nd year which is month-to-month, but we’ve had an unofficial “verbal” agreement that I’d stay until the end of the year. I mean it’s a pandemic, I didn’t think I’d move either. Anyways his gf moved in beginning of this year. It’s been...a lot. She’s obviously had some trauma in the past. I didn’t dig but I believe she was the victim of a home robbery a few years back.Well when she first moved in my roommate had some “ground rules” for me so his gf would be more comfortable. She obviously wasn’t thrilled about having another roommate.He said I couldn’t talk to her (like strike up a convo) if he wasn’t there because she doesn’t want to have to talk to me if she didn’t have to. He also said it would be best if we tried to not use the same facilities at the same time (like if she’s cooking in the kitchen, I should wait until she leaves before I grab food, etc.) Like yes it’s strange but I figured it’s his place so whatever. I’m not trying to befriend her either.Things got worse in recent months cause we’ve all been working from home. It’s REALLY hard to avoid someone 24/7. So obviously I’ve slipped up more. One time I came home from Costco and offered her a spare bottle of coconut water I couldn’t fit in the fridge. Big mistake. My roommate had to have a “talk” with me that night about how I should know she would never drink my drinks and it’s weird for me to even offer. The most recent one was when she was watching some GoT in our living room. I just absentmindedly watched a bit standing behind the couch. I laughed at a scene which startled her when she looked up and saw me standing behind her. I got another earful from my roommate about how I needed to stop “creeping” on her now that I’m home all the time. Long story short, my friend just had a place open up that’s cheap and I’m gonna move. I told my roommate and he’s pissed, because of our unofficial agreement and how he’s probably gonna pay full rent for a while. I feel bad because yeah, I did say I wasn’t gonna move. But I’m also pretty sick of both him and his gf. However, I feel kind of guilty because I agreed to their weird rules before all this started back when I thought it’d be ok."
197,Not the A-hole,AITA ruining my friend's birthday party by taking back the cake I baked for her?,26733,jnxiz8,1223,"My friend is quirky. She was never diagnosed with anything but she is very clueless sometimes. I have had to spell things out for her a lot. Few months back, she borrowed a dress of mine. I really love that dress. There isn't any sentimental value but I got it when we were on vacation few years ago. She also loved the dress and one day just transferred the money to my account and told me that she was keeping the dress.I spoke to her but she just told me that doesn't matter as she has paid me. Her birthday was a week ago and her mom asked me to bake a big cake for her. I usually sell cakes cheap (little more than ingredients cost). On her birthday, I went over to her house with the cake 15 mins before the party was due to start and then decided to talk to her mother. Like I said, sometimes my friend is really clueless sometimes and I was hoping her mom would speak to her and get my dress back. I was very shocked when she also said that as long as I was paid what does it matter. She told me to just move on as it was just a dress and that my friend really liked it. She told me as long the dress was paid for, what am I complaining about. I got really pissed off and pulled out the amount she paid me just paid me, put it on the table, picked up the cake and left. She got mad and started yelling at me that I was ruining the party. I kept walking back to my house. She kept telling me to give back the cake and that I couldn't take it back just because I want to be petty. I just asked what she was complaining about as I had paid back the money. My friend ended up having a cakeless 16th birthday because of this. AITA here?"
198,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling everyone exactly why I'm getting divorced?,26686,i4vv3t,1446,"My ex and I have one child together. We found out during my pregnancy that our child would be deaf, and wouldn't qualify for the surgery that some deaf people are able to get due to a combination of problems. While the external issue is a fluke, the internal issue is apparently something that I always had a 25% chance of passing down to a child. Not to toot my own horn, but once I learned this, I made an effort to start connecting with the Deaf community in my area and learn ASL. He did not, and while he stayed for the birth, he moved in with his brother right after dropping me off at my home. I own the house, and did before I met him, so it's not part of the divorce. He was nice enough to give me 2 months worth of a cleaning service and a gift card to GrubHub. He ended up telling everyone that I am the reason he doesn't see our child, and that I filed for divorce because I overreacted.  The truth is that I have sole custody because he cried, in court, that he couldn't ""deal"" with the baby and wanted to just pay support. While I did file, it was because he abandoned me and said so many horrible things that I couldn't get over. I have text messages he sent me which say that he wouldn't have married me if he knew that we would produce ""problems"" and that he couldn't handle raising a ""r******"" (the only thing wrong with her is hearing). I don't want my child to grow up in a home where she's hated. I was starting to hear all sorts of crap from my family and his, who started to take his side because divorce isn't really a thing here, so I took action. I made a social media post publishing the text messages so that people would finally see the truth. I'm now getting calls and messages for ""making a private issue public"" and ""parental alienation"". AITA?"

I lost my mother to a completely unexpected heart attack in February. We used to be very very close and her death, coupled with the loss of my child devastated me. I slipped into depression, developed anorexia and lost a huge amount of weight in a very short time. I used to be 165 pounds and now I'm at 120 pounds. I attended my best friend's wedding yesterday (tiny ceremony). It was the first social event I attended this year after my ""transformation"". There was an acquaintance there who seemed enthralled by my body. She's very into fitness but she's not someone I am particularly close and she kept asking me about diet plans and said that she needed to know my ""secret workout routine"" for her clients. I politely deflected the questions at first and said something along the lines of ""I just was not in a good place, lost my appetite and it just happened"". But she kept pestering me and said I should help other people lose weight too. I lost my patience and told her that ""I actually developed an eating disorder and severe depression. I don't think your clients would like this routine"". She made a face and left me alone for the day. I thought this would be the end of it.Turns out, after the celebrations were over, she went and complained to my best friend's husband (she's his sister) and he called me and asked me to apologise for ""embarrassing his sister on his wedding"".

200,Not the A-hole,AITA for exposing my sister's lies about why she wanted a house keeper?,26668,c7toni,3554,"My sister is a stay at home wife, no kids for now. Her and her husband had been discussing getting a house keeper to help clean the windows and bathrooms since she said it took a long time.  I was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. Out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. She got defensive and upset, which i wasn't expecting. She said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so I can see how long it takes her if I want to know so badly. So, I did. I got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. Sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. Then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later I was done. I guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what I did in half an hour.  She once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that ""fine I lied about how long it takes because I HATE cleaning those!"" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.I noped out of there fast as I could. I didnt mean to expose a lie, i was just trying to understand my sister more. WITAH?"
201,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my sister to stop telling people that she has my illness to gain sympathy for being overweight?,26665,gl3ib7,1464,"I (22f) have an older sister (25f). My sister is very sensitive about everything. When we were young, if I made the smallest comment like ""I prefer pink over blue"" it would make her cry because she thought I was aiming at her by saying it. My parents would always ask me to apologise to her since she's sensitive and I'm ""emotionally stronger"" than her. My parents never controlled my sister's diet growing up, letting her have what she wants since they found it too difficult to control her. I was skinny as a stick when I was a kid, so even though my family has a long history of thyroid disease my parents didn't think there was an issue with me. However, my sister has been overweight the majority of her life, so my parents thought she'd be the one with the thyroid issues. They took us to an endocrinologist when I was 10. I got a diagnosis for Hashimoto's Thyroiditis while my sister didn't, and instead got told to exercise and watch her diet. I got hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's, and have been on medication ever since. My sister and I moved back in with our parents due to what's happening these days. I leave my medication in a cabinet near the kitchen since I know I won't take it unless I have to actually get out of bed to do so. Apparently, I left a box before I moved out of my parents house when I was a teen and one of her friends saw it while they were over and asked if it was hers. My sister told them that it was, and that's why she was overweight. The box has ""Euthyrox"" written on it in big bold letters with a little picture of a thyroid gland next to it. So yeah, pretty obvious it was meant for a thyroid condition. She's held up this farce for almost 4 years. I only figured it out when I saw her take a box of it out of my bag one day. I confront her on it, and she starts crying and telling me that she just didn't want anyone to mean to her because she's fat. She also says that it's not fair that the one with the normal weight gets the thyroid disease.I'm just staring at her gobsmacked. She's complaining that she doesn't have an auto immune condition? I tell her to knock it off, and that she can't lie to get sympathy from people. My parents talk to me later, and they say that I was too harsh calling her a liar and she probably needs a therapist or something and the classic ""I should apologise since I'm more mature"". They even tell me that they were hoping that she was the one with the thyroid issues as a child, so that they could justify her weight gain. I ask them ""so you wanted your daughter to be sick instead of admitting that it's your fault because you bought her mcdonalds whenever she wanted it, and never made her exercise?"" Now they're mad at me too."
202,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my parents they made my sister getting pregnant ruin my life?,26638,gekfhn,3824,"shes 23f im 18F. Grandma died 8 years ago, and she left more than enough money to pay for all her grandkid's colleges educations with a few stipulations: dont get arrested, do drugs, be a drunk, get pregnant / get someone else pregnant. The money was put into accounts in the parents names since we were all kids then.In sophomore year my sister got pregnant. Shit hit the fan panicking about college, the baby daddy left & she hasnt tried to find him/get child support, & the stress from that caused a hard complicated pregnancy. both are ok.Mom * dad still let her go to college as long as she didnt have another and maintained a 3.5 gpa. which she did. She graduated last December with about 2 grand in debt, I figured her money must have been used to help raise her kid and pay for her pregnancy the past 2.5 years so she had to get a bit of a loan. which seemed understandable.Boy I was wrong! I got accepted to my dream college on the other side of the state, but mom kept trying to get me to go to a cheaper one near home so I dont need a dorm and it would be a cheaper school. I asked her why she was so insistent, grandma left plenty of money i thought. Turns out, they flushed all the money that was supposed to go to me down the toilet to take care of my sister & her kid & her expensive pregnancy, turns out was a lot worse than I was led to believe.I broke down and just lost it crying harder than I ever have. Shouting how they fucked me over and ruined my life for the kid that fucked up. now I'll have at least 70k debt if I go to school. I guess this upset my sister and she asked in a very upset tone if id rather her be out on the streets destitute and unable to care for her kid(who she 'reminded' me was a living being) because she didnt have an education/support system just so I could go on to college and have a good life.I said yes, how its not fair that she got to fuck up, get drunk and sleep with so many guys she doesnt know who the baby daddy is(something she told me but apparently not mom or dad), kept breaking rule after rule while I havent ever even had sex with my bf. And now Im the one that has to be punished for it.everything just keep devolving in to more yelling/fighting until I left. Ive been staying with my bf for the past few days. I know with the rona i shouldnt gp anywhere but i just wanted to be with the one person i feel like actually gives a damn about me.moms been texting/calling trying to get me to come home, saying if i can just be reasonable and not vilify my sister we can probably work something out. I told her unless she has money grandma left for me dont talk to me until I have my college loans paid off in 50 years.Did I go too far? A lot of it was driven by emotion but i really feel fucked over here and like im being punished despite being the one that followed the rules.I've since slept with my bf, i figure if Im getting punished same as if i would have broken all the rules i can at least have fun.3000 char limit is an AHEDIT: been texting sis some this morning to try and mend stuff with her since i didnt think mom and dad spending the money was her fault. she was told about it after she graduated and was asked to keep me in the dark. She has offered to pay for 'a book or two' but not more since she wants to move out to 'get out from under mom and dad's thumb'. probably to party again since she doesnt hide how much she misses it.edit 2: there was a bit left after sis got done at college and was told about it all. They decide to use it to get her a car so she'd be able to get to work. and she went along with it.... now im pissed at all 3 again.EDIT 3: emailed my copy of the will to the  laywer. he says due to how it was set up he cant be certain right now we have a case but theres a good shot.EDIT 4: lawyer says they may have violated the trust grandma set up so hes contacting a trust lawyer friend of his to help make sure hes reading it all rightedit 5:(holy shit so many edits sorry!) auntie got back to me. Shes mad at my parents. when she called to see what was going on all they did was (her words) try to justify it. Turns out dad and mom offered to pay for an abortion and sis didnt want one(understandable i wouldnt ether but still dont always get what we want). and sis thought going on government assistance was trashy and refused. so mom and dad felt like this was the only way to keep her 'safe'. She says they still arent sorry and mom said shed do it again if she had to do it all over. and of course as you might imagine they're mad at me for telling people. But since its just making others mad at the mim just laughing at this point."
203,Not the A-hole,"AITA for having security at my mother's funeral, having certain people barred entry?",26615,ejuz1p,2321,"My parents divorced ten years ago, my father initiated it. He was seeing someone else and wanted to see if the grass was greener on the other side. I neither am for or against his reasoning but I was against how he treated my mother after they finalized their separation. One key event that stands out is in deliberating how assets (or rather, debt) was divided, my father promised my mother that he'd still around, still be in her life, even be friends, and see if they could rekindle their marriage, but only if my mother took every penny of debt. My mother was naive to agree to it, because once the divorce was finalized, my father was on a plane in a matter of days, off to live his new life. It should be obvious that none of us were happy with my father, and I've been no contact the entire time.My mother passed three weeks ago. She is survived by my two siblings and I. I was in charge of the funeral. I knew some of my cousins on my mother's side blamed my mother for their divorce and actively stayed in touch with my father. Imagine that, my mother's family took my father's side in all of this. I also knew there would be a nonzero chance my father would show up, and if he did, it would not be to pay his respects. So I hired security for the funeral and church service.Long story short, my father and his new wife showed up. They were barred entry. One of my aunts got very upset and caused a scene and let slip her daughter, my cousin, invited him. So I had security escort my cousin out of the funeral, too. This event has caused a rift between families, or at least embiggened the one already there. A few of my aunts and a lot of my cousin think I went overboard, some even removing me from Facebook.Was I the asshole in this situation? For what it's worth, I was not super close to those who were ejected from the funeral, nor the ones who caused a fuss. I can live a happy life having zero contact with them again, so I've lost nothing. I'm still no contact with my father (who flew out for the funeral).edit: I appreciate the awards but this is a throwaway account. Why award a throwaway with anything?There's nothing I'm really hiding here. I was the one who knew about the affair because my father left his e-mail open at home when he went off to work, and me being an immature teen decided to snoop. In them, his mistress-now-wife tried to convince him of fantasy things my mother did and tried to turn him against her. Things like she would ask my dad something my mother did to him that was maybe insignificant at the time and twisted it around so it became a bigger deal.Like one instance is when I was much younger, my mother went to bingo without telling him. My dad was the sole income maker at the time. My mom won a fair bit of money but my dad was upset she never told him she went beforehand (with his money). Something that was resolved 10 years prior and which was insignificant in the grand scheme of things, she blew it up to bigger than it was. Many such cases like this she blew things up to convince him to leave my mom.This is why I don't fault my dad for the divorce or separation: I fully blame the other woman. It sucked being 17 at the time but that's life, people get divorced, and it's not my place to get in the middle of my parents' relationship. However, I was upset with his behavior after the fact and the one event I mentioned. Much of my mom's extended family are more *traditional* and view divorce as a tragedy no matter the circumstances. They blame my mom for not ""trying harder"" to keep the marriage together. Once the divorce was finalized, my mother became an outcast to most of her family. This is why a lot of them favored my dad because he convinced my mom that she was why their marriage fell apart. He was a textbook manipulator."
204,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my girlfriend she isn’t welcome at my house anymore unless she seriously fixes her attitude regarding my best friend?,26587,inoaua,1305,"Disclaimer: no, I am not seeking relationship advice or validation on it. I am seeking judgement on refusing to let her come to my house. I (30M) live with my best buddy Mark (30). We decided 2 years ago, we were sick of paying high rent costs and having shitty roommates so we pooled our money together to put a deposit down on a house. It’s a good arrangement as we both have our own separate spaces, it’s cheaper paying a mortgage and we do everything jointly. We’ve also been best friends for 20+ years and enjoy living together. It’s also important to note that I am straight and Mark is gay, but this has never bothered me and it doesn’t impact how I see him. Mark is single after a breakup right now and I’ve been seeing Hannah (was seeing her?) for about a year. I told her right from the start about my living arrangements so in case she ever came to my house, she knew Mark lived there too. It never seemed to be an issue until Mark and his boyfriend broke up and Hannah’s attitude changed. She started making comments saying she was uncomfortable with him around me and that he was “making eyes” at me a lot. I told her she was being ridiculous, so did Mark and we both laughed at the idea of being into each other. We’re complete opposites and are more like brothers and it weirds us both out that Hannah is making comments.I have told Hannah multiple times to stop as this is Mark’s house too and I won’t have him feeling shitty. Hannah just keeps ramping it up and her comments are getting worse to the point she even said he wanted to make a move on me. I finally snapped. I told her that being gay doesn’t automatically mean he wants to sleep with me and her attitude is disgusting. She said she was joking and I said it didn’t feel like a joke. I told her “if you seriously can’t change your attitude and treat Mark like a person, then you’re not welcome here anymore. You’re 30, act like it. Get out.”Hannah has been calling me an AH for treating her like a child and some of her friends have messaged me saying I am being too harsh. I’m asking for judgement as I may be the AH for being too firm and not trying to talk to her about why she is speaking about Mark this way instead of downright refusing to let her be near him.Update: I have come to the conclusion Hannah and I are no more. Thank you for your comments.Update 2: this post received a lot more attention than I thought. I will happily do an update post for all you lovely people.Final update: love who you love! Gay, straight, bi, pan, whatever, who cares? Love whoever you wanna love and enjoy your lives!!"
205,Not the A-hole,AITA for sending my son to school in a dress,26580,d1jjlx,1458,"My son started second grade last week. I get the kids ready for school while my wife sleeps (she's got a graveyard shift). He's got a twin sister. I told them both it was time to get ready for school and his twin sister pulled a bunch of dresses out of her closet. My son picked one up and said ""I want to wear this."" I'm thinking, whatever dude, we're running late just put some kind of clothes on and let's get out the door. I'm pretty politically neutral so while I wouldn't say I was particularly happy he wanted to wear a dress, it also wasn't nearly as upsetting to me as the idea that I could be late for work if we didn't get out the door. I figured ok, I wouldn't ever tell my daughter not to do something because it wasn't ladylike so I shouldn't tell my son not to do something because it isn't manly. I drop him off and get to work. Three hours later we get a call to come pick up our son because his outfit is distracting to the other kids and he's being bullied. He was very sad when my wife got there and the whole morning had been upsetting for him. My wife is irate asking how I couldn't have realized that was inappropriate and I was setting our son up to fail. So is just about everyone else I've run this by. My wife thinks damage has been permanently done because he'll be in the same school system as these kids the rest of his life and he'll be known as ""the one who wore a dress"" and I was being thoughtless or willfully ignorant because I was in a rush and our son suffered for it. At the time, I truly didn't think it was that big a deal, but that doesn't change that I put my son in harm's way so now I'm not sure whether I made the wrong decision or not or how to feel about it. AITA"
206,Not the A-hole,AITA for not donating my liver due to a lawsuit and the person died?,26579,hysbcq,1802,"My (24M) partner's (23F) close friend and boss (50'sM) at the mechanic shop needed a liver transplant. They had been on the list for a while and getting nowhere. Lots of us got tested and I was a match. We were all happy and thrilled that this direct donation could take place.A week before the surgery date, police showed up at our house to arrest my partner as her boss (person who was getting a piece of my liver) had accused her of theft. Claimed she'd stolen thousands from his bank account and stolen from the cash box. The police showed us the Cctv in which she reaches into the box, takes money and walks out of frame. 15 times, 15 days, 15 accusations. The police admitted they had no proof it was theft and no clue on the amounts taken as she used the box to take customers money and change. The police also said they didn't see how she accessed the bank accounts, and that they felt this was some sort of insurance fraud and they needed a scape goat.I immediately rang the hospital and my transplant coordinator and backed out of the surgery. We got on with our lives, partner found a new job and attended the court date where the case was thrown out 6 months later. A week after the case was dismissed, we got word boss had died. No one else had been a match or willing to get tested after news got out, and they never found a match in the transplant system in time.I feel so guilty. I allowed someone to die, pretty much murdered them. I let pettiness get in the way of saving a life. Partner and friends feel I did the right thing, none of this is on me and not giving a piece of me to the person possibly putting my partner in prison for a long time, a week before surgery, is my choice and the right choice. Bosses friends and family have been ringing non-stop, harassing us at our jobs and posting online a lot how I'm a murderer and killed boss. That I should have given the liver anyway and been a good person. I feel I should have given it, but who bites the hand that feeds? I didn't want to get cut open, risk dying and other complications for someone who didn't care for me and mine, but now someone is dead from something I could have prevented. I'm conflicted and losing sleep over this. AITA for not giving my liver to the person accusing partner of theft and them later dying?Edit: thank you for all the positive and informative feedback. I think seeing the outside, impartial view on this has helped me put it in perspective. I've only been focusing on my selfishness causing his death, as opposed to his actions contributing too. I'll be getting some counselling, as suggested, to help deal with the constant what ifs in my brain and to help me move past this and to stop shouldering the burden.Edit: Well, this blew up. Thanks for the awards and positive vibes everyone, much appreciated. Clearing up a few things- gf didn't steal, she was just doing her job getting change/paying invoices. The wife (who admitted to stealing later) simply used footage of her accessing the cash box to try to make it seem like she stole. I didn't state she was innocent as its innocent until proven guilty, and she wasn't found guilty, my mistake. - it's been pointed out that with boss so unwell, perhaps it wasn't him doing this, but his wife. That's a great point I never considered, and now makes me feel even more guilty. I should have checked.- we are in the UK so I guess our legal system works differently to the States in that I didn't have to pay a bail, just simply take her home and take her to the court dates. This could be why the policemen told us straight it seemed like bull and were very candid and kind to us they even bought us lunch when one went to Subway.- also as said, the surgery would have probably been cancelled anyway as I did have another welfare check (or two) scheduled for that week with the transplant team at the hospital and I was hugely stressed out. My work gave me that week and the following off anyway for being such a good sport.- thanks for the dm's calling me a murderer, appreciated...."
207,Not the A-hole,AITA for not inviting the neighborhood snitch or the HOA board to our neighborhood BBQ?,26458,fkrfu6,1677,"There's around 10 houses in my neighborhood of 120 that are not in the HOA, mine included. We (or previous owners) were smart enough to not join the HOA. As a result, i am able to make extensions and I have a pool, which I host neighborhood parties occasionally. My HOA is one of the worst HOAs, constantly fining people hundreds of dollars for parking violations, painting their fences the wrong shades of brown, wrong  color curtains, having 2 flags etc. They're not the worst HOA but they're bad. We also got a shitty neighbor, Jessica, who likes to go around and snap photos of people's violations and then post it on the next-door app to shame them. She prides herself in this thinking it makes the neighborhood better when she shames the Smiths for having a fence thats 2 inches too high, or the Johnsons for having light brown door instead of a dark brown door. Jessica is a fucking cunt, she's probably cost neighbors thousands of dollars in fees or forcing them to renovate. I absolutely lost my shit when Jessica posted in the next door app about how Mrs Jenson (85 year old woman, currently having serious medical issues) has a lawn thats a couple inches too high. She obviously can't mow the lawn and was too busy to notice. The HOA then fined her 500 dollars.I made a post in the next-door app about the next-door app saying that the suburban fascists on the HOA nor Jessica were invited to my BBQ at my house. Jessica went on a ran saying how much of a angel she is and how she protects the neighborhood doing her duty and I told her she's a low life scumbag busybody and is a pathetic loser with nothing better to do. A couple people said I was bullying and excluding her and like 4 of her friends are ""boycotting"" my party and hosting their own party. The party happened and nobody else showed up to theirs and ours was a blast. She apparently cried over it.EDIT: did not expect this post to blow up like that, thanks for the awards and the comments.

208,Not the A-hole,AITA for not allowing my father to meet my dying mother at the hospital?,26443,e2nxtz,4124,"I'm a 25 year old guy and my parents were in the process of divorcing when my mother got diagnosed with a terminal illness. After the diagnosis, my father stalled the divorce proceedings. My father filed for divorce after 26 years of marriage after he fell in love with his younger business partner. She recently gave birth to his child. My mother was a stay at home mom for 25 years who took care of the entire household while my father worked long hours. She was blindsided when my father told her about wanting a divorce. He told her that he would always love her as his best friend and as the mother of his 5 children, but he was also in love with this other woman. My mother was devastated and stopped eating properly. In the middle of the divorce, she was diagnosed with terminal illness and was only given a few months to live. All this time, we, her children have looked after her. I took her to her appointments and we paid for the treatment by taking loans. We didn't ask our father for money, even though he was willing to cover the expenses. Legally, at the time of her death she was still married to my father. During her last days, my father had to move to another city to be there for his daughter's birth. My uncle made a facebook post asking for blood donation (she has a rare blood type) and stated that she was critical. When my dad got to know about it, he immediately flew down to our city. When he showed up to the hospital, he was in a bad shape. His clothes were unkempt. He wanted to see my mother one last time. I told him that there was no use of that as she was unconscious. He begged and cried in front of everyone, I still didn't allow him to meet her. (The hospital authorities let her family decide who was allowed to visit her) My mother passed away the next morning. He still didn't leave and wanted to be there for the funeral and memorial service. We banned him from attending.I believe that he lost the right to see her in her pain when he was the one who caused her immeasurable pain. My buddy tells me that me and (my mother's family) are the assholes for not letting him see her one last time. ---------Edit : I want to make some facts clear -1) When my father told my mother that he was in love with his business partner and wanted a divorce, the other woman was already pregnant with his child. 2) I was/am her legal representative (edit : Power of Attorney, to make things clear ). I had the legal right to deny visitors. My mother's entire family supported me in my decision to not let him see her. My grandma wanted the same. My siblings wanted the same.-------------Edit 2 :3) During her last days, when she was in the hospice, she got to a stage where she could no longer communicate verbally. And she never expressed anything about wanting our father there. In fact, she didn't mention him at all. 4) I realize that this means the end of my relationship with our father. I have accepted that and I have no interest in pursuing a future relationship with him, his new woman or his child. My siblings are on the same page.We have accepted the fact that we have lost two parents forever.I plan to be there for my younger siblings as their pillar of support."
209,Not the A-hole,AITA for acting like a conspiracy theorist to get out of political arguments with my Dad?,26439,egncbw,1576,"My Dad loves to have political arguments/“discussions” with me and other members of the family. I honestly think he does not care about half these issues and just wants to have fights with me and other people in the family. I have tried to simply opt out of them, but my Dad will get upset at me for “not participating with the family dynamic” and “never talking to him.” I also don’t really want him to have these discussions with other members of my family, since they almost always end up in hurt feelings. I’ve been looking for a redirect for a while. I read a post online on doubling down whenever someone says a conspiracy theory, for example if someone says “they faked the moon landing” you say “haha, you sucker, you believe the moon is real?” I decided to implement the strategy after getting into way too many political arguments and upsetting myself and everyone around me.My Dad saw something about climate change and started talking about how the Chinese government partnered with Obama to make it all up. I truly did not want to get into this political discussion. Instead I said, “oh, you’ve heard that, well get this” and discussed my new theory about how the federal government has created a tornado machine to set on people who want to vote Republican in the next election. He was truly flabbergasted at how stupid this was and decided to stop talking to me about this. It was wonderful. I’ve been doing it even more, and I haven’t had a political argument in a whole month. This Christmas, he had a doozy planned. My aunt and her wife are feminist and very pro-choice. At the dinner table, he tried to do a toast to the “death of Planned Parenthood.” Let me note that he is pro-choice, really doesn’t care about this issue, and has said so several times. I think he just wanted to start a fight for the sport of it. Time and place! I said, “oh, thank God you mentioned it, I have to tell you this news I learned” and I talked about how Planned Parenthood does not in fact perform abortions, since it’s physically impossible, but instead removes entire uteruses and replaces them with dog uteruses. I received a lecture about “not taking people’s political views seriously” from my Mom. I said it was just a strategy I use to diffuse political discussions. My Mom said, “you’re just making yourself look dismissive at best and insane at worst.”"
210,Not the A-hole,AITAH for giving guardianship of my son to my aunt over my mother after I die of my terminal cancer,26424,h8ditf,937,"I (21m) have a son who just turned 1, his mum who was my girlfriend died in labour along with the other baby she was carrying. I was diagnosed with terminal cancer 3 months ago and I don't have very long left (two months at most) I have accepted that I'm going to die but now I have to think about what's best for my son.I had to decide who my boy would go to and I thought my mother(55) naturally but then I started to think of her situation as my older(29) lives with her along with his 5 kids all aged under 5 and I decided not to as mum works and my brother tbh isn't really raising his kids, more dragging them up and can be neglectful. I wasn't going to put my son in that environment as I want someone to actually care for him. So I then thought of my aunt(33) on my dads side. she is a good mother and her husband a good father to their 3 girls and I know they could provide for my son. I asked them and they agreed.My mother however found out that I wasn't leaving my son with her and she got angry with me, that she's loosing me and now loosing her grandson. I gave her my reasons and that she realistically can't raise him while she's basically raising a man-child and his kids. It all ended in an even bigger argument and now I'm cooling off at home. I understand that things are terrible for her right now as I won't be here soon but my aunt is a much better choice. It's not like my son won't know who she is as the walk between hers and my aunts is only 5 minutes. Am I the asshole?"
211,Not the A-hole,AITA For asking my GF to pay for a new prosthesis?,26434,ieksvk,3184,"I (M24) had an auto accident over 2 years ago that resulted in a left leg knee amputation, I thought that would been the end of my active lifestyle, I loved all kinds of sports as a kid and I still do.I had a very hard time adjusting to my new normal, my parents were able to get me a prosthetic leg that allowed me to get back to running and going trips with my friends like we always do every summer.The guys were planning an RV trip on the weekend, we had already chosen a destination which was spending some time out in nature and getaway from stress.My girlfriend asked if she could come along, I told her no, this is a guy's trip, Told all my buddies' girlfriends wanted to go but they were firm and put their foot down, she laughed at me for this Then tried to convince me to let her come cause she was feeling stressed out from being at home 24H, I already made up my mind, I wasn't going to ruin the trip just because she wants to be on a guy's trip, I promised her a trip when I get back, she got upset and didn't like the idea.Later on, before I went to sleep, I took my prosthesis off as I do every night, this is my second prothesis, I've already completed a wearing schedule during first year and had to get another prothisis to accommodate any physical changes I had.I woke up in the morning and I couldn't find my prosthesis, I looked where I put it but it was gone, I asked my girlfriend who was doing heavy cleaning around the place, and she said she didn't see it, I was confused it was near my bed, I asked her to stop being childish and playing games and give back my prosthesis because I knew she took it.She's a bad liar couldn't even deny it, she said she wanted to hide it so that I won't go on that trip and leave her alone. I got mad at her for this, I was stunned to find my prosthesis hidden underneath an auto part in the garage, it had been damaged, it was placed in a possession where it had a crack, it was abvious it no longer functions properly, I mean I could still wear it but can't put my whole weight on it cause it would break.I yelled at her and showed her what she did, she said she didn't mean it, I told her she did mean it because she was being childish and jealous over a trip and now she caused me 7000$ worth damage, I told her she ruined everything, that she owed me a new one and that she needed to pay for a new one.She got mad and left, I basically had to use my old crutches it felt absolutely horrible, I called the guys and told them I wasn't coming, it's been a few days, she's mad that I'm still asking her to pay for a new prosthesis and called me an a**** for not apologizing and preferring a ""plastic leg"" over her.I had to call my parents today to tell them they told me she should at least help pay half the expense of a new prosthesis since she caused damage to it, and then consider my relationship with her.Have I been an a**** to her ?Edit: for those asking about where I am, I'm in Asia, From Philippines."

We live in India, Shanaya is an Indian name. I am ALSO Indian. I did not ""pick a black sounding name to make this post sound racist"" or whatever nonsense people on r/amitheangel are spewing and DMing me about. Surprise surprise! People of other ethnicities, religions and nationalities exist, we have names that are not Christian or white sounding, not everyone in this world is  John or Kristen or Micheal or whatever. I don't care if you think this post is fake, but to assume that just because here is a name you are not familiar with you think I am bound to be racist, it makes you racist yourself.I live in a not so well off area. I am not well of by any means, but I have a wifi connection. My wifi has a 4 device limit, its the cheapest plan they have. My neighbours have a 12 year old daughter who has to attend online classes, I know her well because she comes over fairly often to hang out with my daughter as they are friends. Her name is Shanaya. Shanaya's parents told her they cannot afford wifi, so she asked me if she can use mine. I agreed, and said the only condition was that she has to study hella hard and do her best. She agreed and has been using it for a while. Over the past 2 months, I have been finding it hard to use my wifi. The web portal for the wifi says 4 devices are constantly connected to it when all I am using is my phone and my daughter is using her laptop. Sometimes, my daughter can't connect to her own classes and uses data.I asked Shanaya about it last week, and she said her parents forced her to tell them the password and that they have been using it. I went and spoke to her parents about it, and said that it is only for her to be able to attend classes. They said they will stop using it. But over the week, 4 times my daughters classes got interrupted because there were multiple devices trying to use it. Yesterday, Shanaya told me that our other neighbors also have the password and are also using it, that her parents gave it to them. I went and warned her parents again, said I will change the password, but they made false promises again and shut their door. I changed the password and gave shanaya the new one, but her parents forced it out of her again.My daughters education needs to take priority, her classes are important. I can't let her education take a backseat, but if I change it again and not give shanaya the password, her education will get affected. WIBTA if I change the password and not tell Shanaya?"
213,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking if my cousin made her first million yet?,26327,knpbi5,1361,"Hello friends, I'm from the future. Throwaway, yada yada.Well, technically we're a few hours away from 2021. So advanced happy new year.I'm currently outside on our terrace while my family is gathered in the livingroom after having asked me to step outside for a bit, because apparently I've ruined the mood. I'm turning to you guys to ask if I'm the asshole for what I just did.Family from all over the city has gathered to celebrate the new years. Covid is thankfully low in my city and we've taken the necessary precautions.As is typical of Asian family reunions, the old people in the family love to 'check up' on their nieces and nephews. One of my aunt's A, loves to show off her kids' achievements, particularly her daughter Pat. While listing off her daughter's achievements (passing the bar, recently getting married to a fellow lawyer), my aunt turned to me and asked what I've achieved in 2020. She began to list off all my lack of achievements, like how I'm thirty and still unmarred (I'm a dude, if that matters), about how I'm still living at home with my parents and how I'm still driving my shitty 2000-something civic. My other cousins joined in on the jeering and listed all the other failed aspects of my life. Now, I graduated with a degree in architecture, but after multiple attempts just can't seem to pass the exam. This has been a point of contention in the family because my other cousins are lawyers, teachers, etc, whatever. These days I basically work freelance from home. I don't know why, but my aunt's condescending voice got to me and I said ""I made my first million this year. Has Pat made her first million yet?"" Then turning to my cousins I asked the same, ""You guys made your first million yet? Because I have."" The room fell silent. I basically killed the mood. My dad asked me to go outside and relax because apparently I might have just ruined everyone's new year celebration.Was I an asshole?P.S. First million in our local currency not USD."
214,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my parents they were bad parents to me?,26304,kqg77y,1358,"I (19M) have an autistic brother (20M). He’s fairly manipulative because he realized pretty quickly that the threat of a meltdown would get him his way every single time. He is considered high functioning by medical personnel, but he’s got my parents convinced he just doesn’t understand what he’s doing, and they don’t ever punish him. Doctors have told them that he understands and that he knows what he’s doing. They think they know better. They also expect me to revolve my entire life around him. I was never able to do anything I wanted because it upset his routine. I wanted to play a sport, nope his routine. I wanted to get a job? Nope, his routine. Friends? Yeah forget about that. I tried not to be resentful, but I am.The problem: My parents are flipping out because I plan to move several states away and in with my grandparents soon to attend school. They keep trying to guilt me into staying because of my brother. I usually just say that I’m sorry that they feel that way, but I’m still going. Well here’s where I might be the asshole. My mother was going on and on about how the world doesn’t revolve around me and how I was being really selfish and how I was going to ruin my brother by doing this. How they’d always been the best parents they could be to both of us and we both got equal attention.I got frustrated and told her that she was delusional if she thought she or my father were ever good parents to me. They made my life revolve around my brothers, I had nothing of my own, he had to be the center of everything. I said He wasn’t the center of the universe even though she tried to make him it. I told her that the only people who were selfish were her and my father because they actively ignored me in favor of babying my brother who played them like a fiddle to make sure he always got his way. I told her that his routine was not my problem, that it was up to them to make the appropriate adjustments, and asked if she really thought I’d just not live my life because of him?She started crying and I walked off and shut myself in my room. My father is demanding an apology for what I said, but I’m refusing. My grandpa said he’s proud that I stood up for myself, but my parents are still demanding an apology for being an asshole. I don’t think I need to give them one. AITA here?"
215,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking a 47 year old man who is dating my 22 year old niece some pointed questions that made him “uncomfortable”?,26296,dpppvj,3358,"Using a throwaway. Some context I live in CA, and my wife’s niece wanted to come visit us for a few weeks. She’s 22, I’ve known her since she was 4. Her dad walked out on her family when she was 8. She’s very sheltered by her mother. Anyway, I told my wife it was fine with me if she visits. She’s a good kid, and our 5 year old son loves his cousin and really wanted to see her.But then my wife goes, “And she (the niece) wants to bring her bf.....he’s 47.”I’m 41, my wife is 42. I was like “You’re kidding, right?”She wasn’t kidding. At first, I was like “Hell no.” But after about a week of talking, I gave in....with one caveat. I told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, I’m going to ask some questions he might not like. She wanted to know what kind of questions, and I gave her some.1. How did you guys meet and who made the first move? (If the dude made the first move, it’s weird).2. Has the dude been married, does he have kids?3. Why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?4. Are you (the dude) aware of the young woman’s history with her father? 5. What’s the end game here? A serious relationship, marriage? Have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?I know, I’m not the girl’s father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. Her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). So, fast forward to the visit. Niece and old dude show up. I’m cordial. I wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and I invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. Just me and him. Then I start asking my questions. After only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. He told me this is “None of my business.” I got a little pissed at that. I told him he’s staying in my home for a week, I can ask him a few questions. And the girl is my niece, I’m not out of bounds here. He told me I was making him “uncomfortable”. I replied that I’m uncomfortable having a dude who’s clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. I said You can answer my questions and act like you’re a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.Well, he left. My wife and niece were upset with me. They said I acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. Again, I was told it’s none of my business. They have since broken up, which I am glad about. Not sure if my actions were the cause.So Am I an asshole for questioning this guy?EDIT: some info:I asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got “uncomfortable”.I would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. When I took the old dude outside for a beer, I neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. We discussed the new Star Wars movies of all things.I would love to discuss more with some of you, but I was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. So it goes.Edit 2: Some of you here asked what’s up with my wife and her sister. Her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. They’re wonderful people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.FINAL EDIT: Some of you wondered if I would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. Of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and I wouldn’t have a problem. Talked to my niece this morning. She and I are totally fine. Knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. I apologized for my actions regardless. Asked why they broke up.The guy was cheating on his wife. He confessed it to her and said he would get a divorce for her. Has three kids. All her age or older. She dumped him."
216,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking out my sister after she sabotaged a meeting with a fertility clinic?,26278,iotv4b,1563,"8 years ago, my (29f) sister (32f) got pregnant. The father wasn't involved and my sister didn't want the baby, but she also couldn't bring herself to terminate or adopt out to strangers. She approached me and my (now ex) husband, and asked if we would be willing to adopt her child. We weren't sure as we were concerned this would lead to issues down the line but my sister insisted that it wouldn't so we ultimately agreed. Before Lucy was a year old, my husband left us both because my sister lied about Lucy's father.When Lucy was 4, I got together with my wife, and we married last year. My sister has said that seeing me and my wife with Lucy (who is now 7) confirms to her that she made the right decision.When I first adopted Lucy, my husband and I told my sister that we wanted multiple children, which she said she was fine with at the time, but now my wife and I are looking into our options and my sister objects.My sister has been staying with us since July because her boyfriend kicked her out.She keeps asking Lucy if she's sure she wants siblings (Lucy has said that she does), and telling us she's worried we won't be able to give Lucy what she needs, and then today happened.We had an online consultation with a fertility clinic to talk about sperm donation. We told my sister about it and asked her to keep an eye on Lucy while we talked. The wifi went randomly on and off 3 times during the session, booting us out of the call each time. The third time, my wife went to check it and saw my sister holding the power cord, and Lucy trying to plug it back in. Lucy saw my wife and said ""auntie keeps turning the wifi off"". Wife plugged it back in, but we could no longer get into the session and we got an email from the doctor saying that if the wifi is going to be this bad then maybe we should try a more local clinic as we can't do online consultations.When we confronted my sister she admitted that she wants Lucy to be an only child so she has 100% of our undivided attention, and then said in a sarcastic tone ""forgive me for only wanting what's best for my daughter"" to which we responded that Lucy isn't her daughter. Things escalated until I said that my sister should go stay with our parents, and my wife drove her to their place.Since leaving (a few hours ago) she's apologised and begged to come back, and my parents have also asked me to take her back, but I've refused. They've all called me an arsehole for kicking my own sister out after one argument, because now she's unable to get to work (no car and too far to walk) and she's back in her childhood room while at our place she had a studio to herself behind the house.AITA?"
217,Not the A-hole,AITA for secretly feeding my sister vegetables?,26264,duadu9,3140,"My sister is 16 and heavily overweight. She's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. She's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. Diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! I'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of ""fun"" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the EDM and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely HATED it all. The other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in ""acceptable"" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.As a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago I decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. For breakfast I made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the ""green"" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. I make ""cheese"" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. I mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. I have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.It was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. She started this whole argument about how it was ""unethical"" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where I told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (She thinks apple pie is healthy???) My mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but I really think I was making an honest effort to help? I feel bad for yelling at my mom but I dunno, was I really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?**EDIT:** I really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. I just want to emphasize that I'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, I just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. I will try to be more self-informed in the future. I've taken note of her possibly having ARFID, thyroid problems, or PCOS and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up. Also, my mom is really hard-headed but she's still trying, I feel bad that I've made such a horrible impression of her. She has type 1 diabetes that she has to manage on top of her job and taking care of us 2 kids so please don't say she's terrible :( Also, everyone asking me for my recipes can check my comments, I made a comment on this post detailing how I did the cheese sauce and stuff. Thank you very much for your suggestions, I really appreciate them.**EDIT 2**: My mom has type 1 diabetes, my grandma on my dad's side has type 2. According to the doctor my sister is at risk for Type 2 because of her high blood sugar + high cholesterol."
218,Not the A-hole,"AITA For refusing to listen to my parents and wanting to sue my cousin for a ""prank""?",26260,kiaovf,2619,"I 31M) recently had my cousin M21) move in with me after he got kicked out of his college dorm and had no job to pay for rent. My parents told me I needed to step up and help because I own a house, live alone with my two golden retrievers and two birds that I had since last year. My cousin would make fun of me whenever I call my pets ""family"" and thinks I'm crazy. He has a bad sense of humor and thinks he's funny. He calls me funny nicknames like robot/terminator/optimus prime and others because I wear a prosthetic leg that I've gotten after I had an infection *2 years ago.I been patiant with him causing a mess and not even doing his own laundry it's been 3 months and it's too much already. So Recently he started doing pranks and using personal things in his pranks. Like clothes/my phone/stuff from the kitchen etc. I usually take off my prosthesis before going to bed and since I work all day I got to bed early unlike him he stays up til 3-4am. He decided to do a prank and hid my prosthesis somewhere.I saw that it was gone in the morning (*he did it twice before and hid it in his room and the garage) I had enough of his bullshit I asked him where he took it and he joked and said that it was inside the fridge I was livid. I started screaming at him to stop it and to tell me where my prosthesis was before I kick him out. He realized I was being serious and told me that it was in the attic I let him go get it and when he brought it to me he looked worried and started apologizing when I saw the socket had cracks, the adjustment pyramid and pylon were damaged. He told me he hid it under the old tv and didn't think it was this fragile. It was there overnight so the damage has already been done. I lost my shit I yelled at him while all he did was apologize saying it was just a prank ""bro"" which made it worse I told him to leave and called my aunt to tell her about what her son did and that she needed to pay for the damages. her reaction was shocking. she said that it was my fault because I knew how her son is and decided to take him in anyway and that she won't take responsibility for his actions. I told her I'd seriously sue because I'm broke and have no money to pay for a prosthesis and crutches are unbearable. I was so angry. I kept lashing out at everyone. Especially my mom and dad who argued with me and said that I can't sue ""family"" and this is my cousin and he meant no harm. I told them that he created this situation and needed to fix it. They called me awful for refusing to wait til Christmas is over and family gathering is over then they'll figure something out. I told them to stay out of it but until now they're telling me to not cause an issue we're in the holidays and suing my cousin will make them look bad to everyone. I'm stuck here with crutches feeling awful after they all tried to shut me up and told me to wait til holidays are over then they'll ""raise"" money for me and my cousin gets away with it.EDIT: My dad offered to fix it himself but this is ridiculous he thinks that this is some object like a CD player or a tv he can fix. I called him ridiculous to his face And I didn't let him touch it. He clearly thinks it's no big deal. I stopped taking his calls after that because he doesn't realize how big of an issue this is."
219,Not the A-hole,AITA for dressing nicer than the couple getting married?,26226,cpti8j,4281,"A few months ago, my brother and now SIL announced their intention to marry. The invitation to the wedding stated ""No dress code. Wear whatever is comfortable for you."" In hindsight, I think they put that there since the event was at a lake. I didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, I should dress respectably for such an occasion, and I have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. I chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.Yesterday was the wedding. When I showed up, I noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than I was. I'm talking Polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. I did feel a little out of place. My brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my SIL was wearing a modest white dress. The only comment I got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying I looked like I'm marrying the SIL, but that was it.A few hours ago, I got a call from SIL. Holy shit, she is pissed at me! She was asking why I dressed like a pimp, I upstaged her and my brother, and I stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. I referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and I was dressing respectfully. She was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. I told her that she should've specified ""not formal"" to leave less interpretation freedom. She asked if I was that retarded. I told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. I hung up. She spammed my phone with calls, so I blocked her and texted my brother I'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.Was I in the wrong?Edit: clarified she said I stuck out on the photos.Edit 2: My brother said I'm welcome to come over for dinner later. I unblocked her number. No call spam, so that's a good sign.Edit 3: Had dinner with my brother and SIL earlier. She showed me the pictures, and I can kind of see what she was talking about. I told her I'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because I did notice I was out of place and I should have tried to do something. She said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she's still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head. So yeah, I don't think we're gonna be on Jerry Springer as far as I can tell."
220,Not the A-hole,AITA for banning my father from my home because he banned me from his when I was younger?,26189,i8znou,1909,"When I was 15, my father married a woman I just could not get along with. And there was a lot of friction with her daughter as well.Eventually, the fighting got so bad that my father told me that he would exercise his custody at my grandparents house instead, effectively banning me from his own home.I said thanks but no thanks and stopped seeing him as per the custody schedule.He did make attempts to fix our relationship but I wasn't interested. We would see each other at family events and we were nice enough to each other but that's it.It's now 13 years later and I'm married with a 1 year old.His wife has passed away in an accident a few years ago and I'm assuming he's lonely now.But I don't really want to be his backup plan.He comes to see my son once a month and I only see him at the park and don't engage much with him myself.Last December, he point blank asked me why I never invited him to my home for dinner or why I never accepted his invites to visit him.I told him the the truth. He was very upset but it's the reality of the situation.Was I the asshole?"
221,Not the A-hole,AITA for DEMANDING my SIL replace the expensive fabric she and her children DESTROYED with EQUAL fabric?,26145,e4nn5v,2901,"I am STEAMING mad about this and everyone around me is pretending like I'm being a cunt. I'll let you people decide. First, I sew my own clothes. My husband and I live in a very nice house with a HUGE room filled with gorgeous sunlight for my hobbies.We hosted Thanksgiving. My SIL and her three kids were staying with us, despite that she always treats me like shit for preferring pets over kids.On Tuesday, as I went to do some last-minute shopping, my SIL texted about a tablecloth for her kids to put down while they did Christmas ornaments. I walked her through the closet with the VERY. CLEARLY. MARKED. TABLECLOTHS.I got home 3 hours later and checked in on everyone. When I went into the hobby room where everyone was gathered, I saw it. SHE PULLED MY FUCKING ATELIER BRUNETTE FABRIC FROM THE CLOSET. MARKED. FABRIC. This particular style was discontinued several years ago, but I snagged for $25/yard. I had 6 yards. Let me note that fabric is EXPENSIVE and I have always sourced from thrift stores, deep clearance, etc. This was a GIFT to myself.I fucking screamed ""What the hell are you doing?!"" and ran to the table. She looked alarmed and acted like she had no idea what she'd done. Her fucking kids spilled all kinds of paint all over the fabric. I told everyone to STOP, put DOWN the crafts, and get OUT.After I fucking cried over that fabric and tried my best to salvage it, I demanded she replace it, and said how. She argued that she had no way of knowing that ""ugly ass"" fabric was for something other than a tablecloth, because it didn't look like anything anyone would ever wear seriously. I said I expected 6 yards.Black Friday she and the girls handed me a JoAnn Fabric bag. They handed me 6 yards of an absolutely hideous Keepsake Calico fabric. Typically $9.99/yard but on sale for $3.99 this weekend.I asked her if she was being serious, and she said yes, here's 6 yards of ugly ass fabric. I deadpanned ""Get the fuck out of my house. Now."" and she got very angry and started arguing with me that it's not her fault that I have expensive taste. I told her to leave, now, and not to come back unless she has EQUAL. QUALITY. FABRIC.Of course I'm being told what an awful, evil person I am because I wouldn't ""graciously"" accept her insult of shit quality quilting cotton. For those who don't know fabric, this was like presenting someone with a 2001 Honda Civic after crashing their 2020 Maserati.AITA?**EDITED AT THE REQUEST OF A POSTER:**  To be very clear, SIL had to go *far* out of her way from where I directed her to grab the fabric. It was not even kept in the same room, let alone closet, as the tablecloths which were CLEARLY marked. There was no reason for her to be IN the fabric closet. The was not an ""honest mistake"" by ANY stretch of the phrase. When we were on the phone, I directed her SPECIFICALLY to the linen closet. She had to DELIBERATELY go OUT OF HER WAY to grab the fabric.**SECOND EDIT:**  The linen closet is next to one of the bathrooms, where I directed her. Each shelf is labeled with what they're for, towels, guest towels, bed, guest bed, etc. I said ""You see the shelf marked tablecloths? There's one with paint on it. You can use that."" The fabric closet is in the master bedroom (NOT the craft room even), and each larger cut of fabric is kept inside of a plastic tub, often times in a vacuuum sealed bag, labeled with the yardage, manufacturer, and fiber content.**THIRD EDIT:** Several people seem to have a personal issue with my writing style, use of caps, explanation of my large hobby room, etc! These aren't part of the issue, but seem to really upset some of you. I find that very interesting and wonder if it would be the same if it was a man describing his video game dungeon and battle station! I take a lot of pride in coming from a working class background and having a room dedicated to my hobbies. I hope you all get to enjoy a space of your own eventually as well. <3"

I like dandelions they are good for the bees2. I have pet rabbits, dogs, cats, and a tortoise i like to roam the yard and all of them eat or at least nibble and lick the grass so it’s literally poisoning my pets.So anyway, I kick her the fuck out and take all my pets inside.Now 2 of my rabbits are dead and another is in critical condition. I’ll never be able to let my pets outside again to eat the grass because weedicide takes forever to go away because it can sit in the soil for who knows how long and Im worried that the dogs and cats might end up having a reaction too since they also nibble the grass (call me overprotective or over cautious IDC I love my animals) So I’m suing her for: damage to my property because it is now unusable for my animals, veterinary bills, and emotional damage due to the deaths of my two rabbits.I’m also trying to get the cops to pursue a case of animal abuse or at minimum criminal damage because she did basically poison my animals but I doubt anything will come from it because I have to prove ill-intent but they are pursuing her for criminal trespass. She’s a Karen. I think she deserves it for thinking she had any right to be on my property at all and especially because it’s killed my pets and now Idk what to do about my lawn because I’m not risking another animal’s life by letting them out (at least unsupervised for at least a year. However my parents and my girlfriend think I’m being unnecessarily cruel because it “was an accident and she thought she was just being a good neighbor, and that Im making it to be a bigger deal than it is” and should just ask for her to pay my vet billsEdit: info, she has asked me about the weeds beforeI don’t remember it verbatim but Basically the conversation was along the lines ofHer: “hey I see you have a lot of dandelions/ weeds have you noticed that too” Me: “yup i enjoy the look of a natural lawn” Her: “Something about my new car.”The endSince she has a kid that she always asks can come over to play with my rabbits I assumed she knew they ate them if she was looking over my fence that often she’d notice the dandelions were only ever flowering in 1/4 of the lawn at a time because my rabbits got cycled in a way that most of the lawn was mostly weed free while the part they couldn’t get to that week would be sproutingEdit again: thanks for the messages guys. Im taking the advise and getting a security camera and a padlock for the fence also i am in fact getting a necropsy done.Edit edit edit: i have talked to her. Told her that my rabbits died after the fact and there was staining on their pen. She said “it’s weedicide not pesticide they were probably just sick”Edit edit edit (last edit this is blowing up too much I gotta walk away sorry if i didn’t answer your question) but my rabbits were actually outside when she did this and there was a stain on their pen. I can’t prove it but Im pretty sure they got a direct spray.UPDATE: I got a call from my vet monday morning the necropsy is back my rabbits died from corrosion to several internal organs and had corrosive burns lining their mouth and nose. My 3rd rabbit can also come home today and only has minor injuries to his throat and a small injury resulting in superficial hair loss and mild irritation on his nose. He’ll be on pain meds and just in case I have critical care ready For those without rabbits when rabbits are in pain and sometimes in mourning they sometimes refuse to eat so critical care is basically a mix powder you can syringe feed to keep their digestive system functioning because GI stasis can be life threatening.Also I’ve contacted a lawyer to move forward with a lawsuit, but they haven’t responded, probably won’t until later today because i contacted them yesterday through email. And for the lawn and garden people from my last post the vet thinks the stuff the neighbor used wasn’t a commercial herbicide because of those chemical burns as well as because it killed my crabapple tree and the bit near my fence and pool are bare.Please in the future avoid messaging me for updates I have no reason to keep you guys updated for any reason my life and my animals at the end of the day is my business not yours. I will try to keep you updated but remember this is my LIFE. Getting a message every day asking for an update IS RUDE. Also definitely NEVER EVER comment on another one of posts asking for updates or for information that’s just beyond rude STOP IT. Im allowed to make other posts without being reminded of this you’ll get updates as they come and as I please not as you demand. Thank you."
223,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to cook meat when my husband broke our (lonely) daughter’s only friendship because he hates vegans?,26096,kajk15,2793,"obligatory throwaway because I don’t want angry vegans in my inbox.My husband is from the south and let me just say this, he hates vegans. His family is a stereotypical country one and they get ridiculously mad when they see beyond meat etc adverts on the tv. They’re practically vegan phobic and hate any menu which says suitable for vegetarians or vegans etc. This never really bothered me and I thought it was funny because I ate meat and I didnt think it was a big deal.My daughter (now6) was born allergic to a lot of things, like eggs and is also intolerant to lactose and grass, pollen etc. She rarely got to go to birthday parties because we couldn’t let her eat anything there. when she was a baby my husband ate an egg sandwich and kissed her and she broke out in hives and we had to take her to the doctor. All new foods were tried under medical supervision.While she can eat meat she can’t eat any fun meat like nuggets because of egg contact. One of the kids she recently met with is our new Neighbour who is around four houses away. They are completely vegan and their son doesn’t eat anything they don’t. So at his birthday she could eat the actual  cake and not a muffin I’d sent. It cheered her up and they had play dates even when we weren’t supposed to. I was glad she made a friend.His parents  hadn’t called for a while and didn’t pick up ours. When I saw his dad while I was out I was like ‘hey what’s wrong‘ and he was really hostile, telling me to never talk to him or his wife again and that he’d pray for my daughter. I thought that was crossing the line. He pulled his phone out and showed me a very rude text from my husband. I didn’t believe his story that my husband started a fight, but when I asked him about it he was proud that Shelia wasn’t hanging out with hippies. I remembered the vegan hate and I was like until he apologized to that family and they agreed to let their kid play with ours I’d never cook meat again. He said I needed to get over it and do my Job but I am cooking, just not what he would like. AITAEdit: I will try to find couple’s counseling although I don’t think he’ll agree to it. I hope Ina forgives me (vegan mom, since this blew up, I’m really very sorry and I won’t bother you again.) thank you all for your responses."
224,Not the A-hole,AITA For Refusing To Crochet Something For My Brother's Future Baby After Years Of Teasing?,26062,jwc9l1,2145,"Throwaway AccountI (24m) have never been like the other men in my family. I'm introverted, artistic, and would rather cosplay than play sports. At age 14 my great-grandmother moved in with us and she taught me how to crochet. I loved it but my brothers, Jim (27m) and Tim (27m), used to tease me constantly for it when she wasn't around and whenever I would complain my dad told me that life's full of people that are going to call me names and that I need to ""toughen"" up. I honestly think he was just disappointed that I wasn't an extroverted jock like him and his other sons, felt like he could just pressure me into becoming more like him.When my great-grandmother died she didn't have much but she specifically left me her crochet ""hooks"" and I was very touched. She also left my cousin an unfinished baby socks that she was crocheting for the my cousin's baby, and I could tell my cousin was disappointed. We kind of had this tradition of our great-grandmother making things for the coming babies. I offered to finish what our great-grandmother started, using her hooks, and my cousin was thrilled at the gesture.After that I kinda inherited the position of crocheting things for any new babies in the family and I rather enjoyed it because I felt as if I was carrying on a legacy. Although, it did nothing to stop my mediate family from making jokes and calling me names. Despite the constant attacks against my sexuality Jim, ironically, came out as gay and has since apologized for his past treatment of me so we're on good terms but Tim is still a jerk to me.When I went to college I went low-contact with Tim and my father and would just tolerate them at family events. Last week Tim announced that he and his girlfriend, Tina (24f) were engaged and expecting their first child over social media and everyone was thrilled. During a zoom meeting with the family Tina said she would love a matching blanket, little hat and shoes for the baby from me, and I asked her to send me a copy of her registry for baby clothes. Tim laughed and said everyone knows that it's tradition that I make the items. I told him flat out that he doesn't get to make fun of my skills as a crocheter and then expect free labor from me.My dad said that I was being rude and needed to apologize. I countered that if Tim was hurt by my refusal to crochet for him then he should just ""toughen"" up and get over it and then left the call. Since then I've been getting text messages from my parents and Tim saying that I'm being petty and a jerk to Tina and the baby, but I haven't responded. AITA for refusing to crochet something for my brother's baby after years of teasing?Edit: Okay since I keep seeing this I'm just going to give some info. Yes I am aware that you crochet with HOOKS and not ""needles."" When my great-grandmother was teaching me she referred to them as a ""needle."" Granted she obviously made a mistake but when I was first learning it just stuck so that what I always refer to them personally and I will correct it.Edit For More Info: For more information the last time my dad and Tim made fun of /harassed me crocheting something was last year at Christmas. It's not like they stopped teasing me, calling me rude names, or questioning my manhood when I went to college."
225,Not the A-hole,"AITA for letting my brother call me ""dad"" and refusing to tell him the ugly truth?",26045,ehmsme,1121,"I'm well aware that this story sounds extremely hard to believe and fake, and I'm aware that there will be many ""shitpost"" comments below. Sorry, but this story is 100% true and it is a hot topic of discussion in my family at the moment.I was born when my parents were both 19, and my only other brother (let's call him Josh) was born when they were 42. They divorced shortly after Josh was introduced to the world (he was 4 months old at the time), and they both wanted nothing to do with the child. At the time, I was 23 and I was living alone with my then-girlfriend who was 21 (now my wife), and I done my best to convince at least ONE of them to take care of young Josh for his sake and the family's sake, but they refused adamantly and said that I should be taking custody of him instead. So I became legal guardian of my brother and he's been living with us for the past 12 years and things have been going really smooth for us.Josh, now almost 13, has been calling me ""dad"" and my wife ""mum"" and our two children (4F, 9M) his siblings and he has absolutely NO idea about his real parents, and to be honest, I let all of that slide. He has NO idea that I'm really his blood brother and not his father, and I'm starting to feel guilty and a little weird.Some of my uncles and aunts come to visit occasionally and they are really disgusted at the fact he calls me ""dad"" and they are surprised I haven't told him the truth. They constantly messaged me, talked to me in private and I cannot chat to them without this one particular topic rising up - badgering me to let him know already but I refused.I discussed this with my wife and she thought it would be wrong to tell him the truth because none of my parents wanted to take care of him and I'm the only person in the world who gave him the ""father figure"" everyone deserves.I feel that he has the right to know what he is to me and what I truly am to him, but he's suffered enough already and I just want things to continue how it is. Reddit, AITA? WIBTA if I let him know the truth?**UPDATE**: About 70% of the comments are advising me to tell my son who I really am to him, and some are saying ""sooner than later"". I've just got up to discuss this with my wife and now after a lot of hesitation, we've decided that it's best the truth comes from us and it has to come now. Right now, it's late for us, but we shall address this to him first thing this week, or even tomorrow. Thanks guys."
226,Not the A-hole,AITA for reporting my teacher over a very uncomfortable joke?,26044,gwh6qk,1467,"I (F20) have been in a bakery course since September and every Wednesday we have an 8 hour hands on class. The teacher (M50) is a very friendly man, but his sense of humour is kind of on the edge of acceptable. He'd been making sex jokes about me and some other girls in my class all year, but they were still kind of funny. Last week he called me from the other side of the room saying his friend sent him a video and it made him think of me, as a joke. I approached  him and he gets the video out, everyone else was busy doing their thing. He showed me the video and skips through it. It was a lesbian orgy porn. I got super uncomfortable and froze. I couldn't do anything but chuckle in shock. I laughed it off, didn't say anything about it and went back to what I was doing. I know I should've said something then but I just couldn't. It's been making me lose sleep since last week. I feel grossed out, objectified and my self worth has plummeted. So today I decided to call someone at school who I trust. I told her what happened and that I wanted to arrange a meeting with witnesses where I tell him that he crossed a boundary. But she said she wanted to tell his boss and get an investigation started. Now he's gonna get in trouble because of me, even though I wanted to give him a warning first. AITA for reporting my teacher over a joke?Edit: I thought I'd post this because I had a lot of trouble trying to figure out the things I was feeling. Never in my wildest dreams had I expected this much of a response. Thank you all for your thoughts, upvotes, and the awards. I've gathered some useful information and I feel better knowing that people support me, even though they're strangers on the internet. Thanks guys."
227,Not the A-hole,AITA for putting my dog's wee-wee pads on the bathroom floor b/c my BF has bad aim and keeps missing the toilet?,26025,gdhfdi,4029,"My boyfriend (30/M) and I (28/F) have been together about a year and when our city implemented lockdown for the virus, he decided to quarantine with me at my apartment as I live alone and have a nicer apartment and he has several roommates.Mostly it has been going well and thankfully we both still have jobs, except in the first few weeks I started noticing that the bathroom floor was suddenly always wet around the toilet. (The sink is across the room from the toilet so it's unlikely to be from the sink.) At first I thought it might be water but soon realized that it was definitely pee. I asked BF about it nicely, and he apologized and said sometimes he has bad aim. I asked him to try a little harder and he said sure.The floor continued to be frequently spattered with piss, and a few weeks later I confronted him about it again because I think it's pretty gross to step in his pee several times a week, and it seems like an easy thing to fix. If he misses the toilet, I think the very least he could do is make sure to wipe it up with toilet paper or a Clorox wipe. (The cleaning supplies even live in a cabinet directly over the toilet.) He said sure, sorry, he would try to remember to do that. Another week has passed and while maybe he's doing this sometimes, I've continued to step in splatters of his pee and wipe it off the floor and clean the floor several times a week. I thought about asking him to just pee into the bathtub or something instead, because I don't understand how you can pee on the floor by accident so often and not notice and not clean it up.Last night I got up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and absolutely stepped in piss for the 12312301298th time. I had HAD it and I didn't want to pick a fight or ask him again since it seems clear he can't or won't change, so I got one of my dog's wee-wee pads from when he was a puppy (he is well trained now) and cut it up a bit and taped it down to make a sort of ""skirt"" or mat around the floor near the toilet to at least absorb the piss. BF saw this morning and is FURIOUS with me, saying that I'm calling him a dog, comparing him to an animal, etc. Honestly, I was not thinking that at all, I just was trying to be resourceful and solve the problem for myself since I don't like piss on my bathroom floor and don't like stepping in it, I didn't feel like arguing about it anymore, and putting a material specifically meant to absorb pee around the area he keeps peeing on by accident seemed like a practical solution. AITA?"
228,Not the A-hole,AITA for pressing charges?,26014,jn5elo,3092,"My cousin turned 18 recently. She’s in high school. She doesn’t have a car, and during her birthday weekend, thought her parents were going to buy her one. They didn’t get her one and she was pretty upset. I should note that I’m not very close with my cousin. Or the rest of my extended family for that matter. I only heard about this through the grapevine from my dad. AnywayMy cousin texts me on the Friday before her birthday asking if she can take my car (I just leased a new Ford escape) to the mall and then for an out of town road trip with her friends over the weekend. I tell her no. She begs and pleads with me. I tell her no again. My car is for me to drive and for me only. If she wants her own car she can save up and buy one. She calls me a bitch and says that I ruined her birthday and that she’s embarrassed because her friends think she got a car for her birthday and she doesn’t have one. I don’t respond to her and think nothing of it. The weekend comes and I sleep in very late on that Saturday, waking up at 1:00 pm (don’t judge lol). Even though my car is parked in my driveway and my gate is closed, I come to realize that someone egged and TP’d my car. With many, many eggs and 5-6 rolls of TP. And since the weather was warm outside, the raw egg baked into my car, along with the dried up toilet paper, destroying the paint. Since I have security cameras around my house, I decide to go back and watch. At around nine thirtyish that morning, I see my cousin and a bunch of her stupid friends vandalizing my car. I’m surprise she didn’t smash the windows and poke holes in the tires too.To save my post from the 3000 character limit, I obviously pressed charges and my cousin is in legal trouble. Her and her parents are pissed off at me for pressing charges, her parents telling me that she’s “just a kid” and that she’s been through a lot of ‘emotional stress’ doing virtual schooling for this past year and that I should take that into consideration, and that I should be ashamed of myself for pressing legal charges against my baby cousin, that I’m almost 30 and dont I remember what I was like at that age? (I do remember, and I wasn’t stupid enough to egg anyone’s car) and can’t she work something out with me like doing chores around my house for money if I drop the charges... that she’s young, that she doesn’t need a felony on her record, etc. and that it was just a prank. Right after I press charges, my cousin was calling and texting me over and over saying that this could’ve been avoided had I let her take my car. Am I the asshole in this situation?I need to add that my cousin already has a felony on her record, a DUI. She’s not remorseful of anything.Also, my aunt and uncle will not pay me for the damages. They just want me to drop the charges and pay for everything myself like nothing happened. They are cheap."
229,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my grandma she looks like Ronald McDonald because she wouldn’t stop telling me I look like a bull with my nose ring in?,26003,cre4qy,2415,"Edit: getting a lot of comments about this so thought I’d make an edit. My piercing is NOT a septum which makes the weird insult even more stupid. Septum piercings are usually tagged as “looking like a bull” (I don’t agree with that) but I have my hoop in my nostril.Here’s how it happened. Every time I see my grandma, she tells me something to the effect of “take that thing out of your nose, you’re ruining a pretty face by putting a hoop in it like a bull.” The last time she said it to me I politely asked her to leave it alone or next time I wouldn’t be so polite. To be fair this is the first time I spoke up because I’m not confrontational but the older I get the more I stand up for myself. And for that matter, I shouldn’t even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. Fast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. I immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like Ronald McDonald. A lot of people are pretty pissed off at me but A) I warned her and asked her to stop and B) she’s insulting my appearance so why is what I said any worse than what she has said to me a million times? I’m usually all about respect and politeness but my nose ring (in my nostril not my septum by the way so the bull comment doesn’t even make sense) does not “ruin” my face and even if it does it’s really not her place. I’m a grown ass woman and I refuse to be bullied by any even older grown ass woman. So, was I the asshole?"

I cut my sister off the day I found out. We have not spoken since, we have not been in the same room for more than ten seconds and I will not have a relationship with her moving forward. This year has been rough and Covid made some things easier regarding there was no visiting family so the pressure was gone. But recently my mom wanted to have a family dinner again and I told her I would not go because I did not want to be in my sisters presence. She told me I can't avoid her forever, she's my sister and we share family. I told her I can and I will. Her response was telling me I am being unfair making her choose between us and I said I'm not making her choose because I'm fine not being invited, I know my stance means I will end up being excluded. But I will not play nice with her and my ex. Especially now that they are getting married too. We're never going to play happy families. I don't want to be civil to them. So I would rather not have anything to do with them. And they will never have anything to do with me again.My mom thinks I'm being very unfair.AITA?Edited to add since this was asked: My dad died 9 years ago."
231,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my sister see her kids?,25989,g6zfpa,1578,"I (28f) obtained custody of my sister's (35f) kids (9m,4f,2f), back in 2018, after she left them alone for two weeks to go on a ""trip"" (read. drug bender). Of course this was a huge transition for the kiddos, they had to be moved schools and daycares, and of course couldn't see their mom anymore. Now, the kids are doing better and definitely lead happier lives. Recently, though, my sister was released from prison, and wants to see the kids again. She called me, begging to have a visit with them, and telling me that I could give them back because she was out of prison now. I've had a talk with the 9 year old, and he says that he doesn't want to see his mom yet, and that he still hates her for leaving him alone. The girls have no memories of her, and the smallest one was only three months old the last time she saw her.I do feel like I could have helped them foster a better relationship with her, but I don't want to force the oldest into meeting her when he absolutely doesn't want to.Still, my close family has told me that the oldest doesn't know what he's talking about, and it's my fault the little ones don't remember their mother because I didn't take them to see her when she was in prison. They also told me that it's my responsibility to force them to meet her, even when they don't want to, because that's what's best for them and they shouldn't grow up without their mother.So, AITA?Edit- I have spoken to a professional about this, specifically the oldest's therapist. They have advised that it should be up to him. I just want to know if I'm being a jerk to my sister. Also, I have adopted the kids, and have full custody of them."
232,Not the A-hole,AITA for cancelling on a group of very out of shape women that hired me to train/guide their hikes?,25927,canwj2,712,"First up please know I am trying my best to be kind in my wording. I run a small operation where I guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. I have served all kinds of clients.I got an inquiry for a group called ""Womens+ Adventures"" and because it was during Pride Month, I thought maybe it was an LGBTQ+ group. I chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and I started the training plan.The group wanted to work up to ""A 14er"" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. Going off what everyone reported, I decided Gray's Peak. One of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.When I arrived for our first group hike, I learned ""Womens+"" meant plus-sized women rather than LGBTQ+. No issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  The first hike was... awful. It was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. Several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. When we got started hiking, it was very slow. One woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. One ate all of her snacks after the first break. Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. After we got back (6 hours later) I pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. She insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that I didn't believe them. When I suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. I gave them all ""homework"" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. Several of them laughed at me incredulously.2nd Hike went even worse. I had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. So I called the head and told her that I thought it was best if I refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. Well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that I am fatphobic, I'm mocking them, etc.Please, PLEASE keep in mind that I have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. I consider myself to be VERY patient. One of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. Simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. I refunded the money and ended contact only to find my Social Media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. You can guess what I was called. I felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me I was an asshole for not powering through, that I should have given them THREE chances, that I should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.AITA?"
233,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling the cops when my bf's sister left her children with me for a few days which ended with her getting a felony charge?,25915,ijffjm,2987,"I am pretty sure I am the AH and I did not think something this bad would happen. This happened about a year ago. Me and my BF have been together for 5 years. His sister, Claire, has a 1 year old baby, Alex. Claire is a single mom and sometimes drops her baby off at our place when she has some errands to run. I will be honest here. I have no clue how to take care of a baby. I play with the baby but other than that my BF usually takes care of Alex. My BF work is onsite. So he usually isn't home for 4 days and then comes home for 3 days. One day, Claire asked my BF if she can drop off Alex for the day. BF was supposed to leave for work that evening. Since she had said that she will pick up the baby by evening, he didn't mention that. Big mistake. He left around 5 pm. I was waiting for Claire and kept calling her. She picked up the phone around 8 pm and told me that she went to a place few hours away with her friends. She told me to tell BF to take care of Alex for next 3-4 days. I told her that BF already left for work. Then she just told me ""Then you take care of Alex. I will back in 4 days."" And then she hung up on me and switched off her phone. I freaked out hard. I cannot call BF because he is unreachable onsite. Neither of us have family in the state that we could have called. I called few friends but no one gave me anything helpful. The bag she gave with Alex only had diapers left in it. The baby was crying her head off and I didn't even know what to feed her safely. I literally didn't know how else to do. So, I called the police and told them what happened. They directed me to a social worker. While the social worker was helping me take care of the baby, the cops called the cops where she was to locate her. The cops found her high marijuana and she had enough on her for them to classify it as possesion and intention to sell (Edit: I don't think she actually sold anything. She probably just brought enough for her and her friends for the next few days). She didn't get any jail time. She had to do community service and plead guilty. Unfortunately, that also meant she got a felony conviction. This got her fired and she hasn't been able to hold on to a good job since. In my defense, I only wanted her to come back because I didn't want anything to happen to Alex because I am not capable of taking care of her. I did not think she was doing anything that would get her arrested. In her defense, she has left Alex at our home plenty of times, so it's not unreasonable for her to think that I would have no problem taking care of Alex for a few days. Also, this was probably the first time she took a break for herself since Alex was born. My boyfriend was pissed in the beginning but came around later. Their parents also think I wasn't in the wrong. She obviously hates me and thinks I ruined her life because she wanted a break for a few days. This got brought up recently at a family dinner which is why I ask. AITA?"

When my daughter turned 4 months old, he married his current wife. I met my husband when my daughter was 2 years old and married him when she turned 3. My daughter is now 7 years old and I have a 3 year old son with my husband. My ex has two daughters with his wife, who are 6 and 4. My ex has an every other weekend visitation with our daughter. Now my daughter used to call my husband 'popi' , but ever since the birth of my son, my daughter has started calling my husband 'daddy'. That's what I call my husband when I address him in front of my son, and my daughter has kind of picked up on that. We never told her no, because my husband loves my daughter and thinks of her as his own. He has stayed up nights taking care of her the times she has been sick.Now, she doesn't have the same relationship with her stepmother. She has always called her stepmother by her actual first name, and it has always been that way, even though her stepmother has known her for a longer time than my husband. Here's why I'm wondering if I'm the asshole. The other night, when me and my husband went to pick up my daughter from her dad's, my daughter ran out of their door happily saying ""mommy and daddy are here, I'm going home!""When my ex heard her address my husband as 'daddy', he turned visibly upset. Later when we got home, my ex blew up on my phone saying that I was emotionally abusing my daughter by 'making' her call another man ""daddy"" and that I needed to make her stop. I said that our daughter has all the right to call my husband daddy if it makes her happy. He then asked me how I'd feel if he made our daughter call his wife ""mommy"". I told him that if my daughter hasn't called her "" Mommy "" after 6 years of knowing her, it is because she never wanted to. I said that it isn't my fault if our daughter feels closer to her stepfather and actually loves our family together. After saying that, I hanged up. The next day my ex mother in law called me accusing me of parental alienation. This is honestly messing with my mind. My husband loves my daughter. Is it really bad if we let her call him ""daddy""?. He loves it and in fact, he always says that he has 2 kids."
235,Not the A-hole,AITA for changing the package pickup each time someone uses my email for orders?,25837,heoy9x,1466,"So pretty much, there’s this guy who keeps ordering things with my email. He isn’t using any other personal information of mine so i don’t think it’s a privacy concern. So back to the point, I will occasionally get emails from random websites about an order confirmation. I’ve never heard of most of those websites and I know for a fact none of my family members used my email to buy something.With most emails, there’s a number, name and an address (I’m assuming it’s the persons address) attached. I’ve tried texting the number and even calling but I’ve never gotten an answer. I’d always get emails from ups to confirm the pickup/drop off area. Ever since I’ve gotten the emails, I always change the location for delivery. So instead of it being delivered at his doorstep, it gets shipped to a post office 20 miles away. He can’t change that since like I said, it’s all attached to my email.I recently got an email from the guy and turns out, the reason he keeps writing my email is because his and mine are both almost identical. (Imagine mine is “abc” his is “acb”) so he always switches one letter therefore I get the emails. In his email, he calls me an asshole for making the pickup so far. When I asked him why can’t he just use his own email he said: It’s always a typo I do and I don’t feel like fixing it because it takes too much time.I’m not even joking, that’s exactly what he said.So AITA for sabotaging this guys packages?"
236,Not the A-hole,AITA for exposing the real reason my sister and her bf broke up.,25762,byiwjh,2263,"throwaway, and I will be keeping this is Anonymous as I can, every name will be fake. my sister (cas) 25f and her boyfriend (jon) of 3 years 24m broke up last week, I'm good friends with jon and we chat in a discord server often. I assumed it was a mutual breakup and so asked Jon if he was doing ok, he then asked me if I knew the reason they broke up. I said no and he explained that it was because he was bisexual, he even showed me screenshots where it showed how homophobic my sister is, I was shocked and apologized to him. the next day I was scrolling through Facebook and noticed my sister had made a post about the breakup, turns out she is claiming that he cheated on her. she must of blocked him so he could not show the actual truth. with Jon's permission I posted all the screenshots on my Facebook page.  it caused my parents to call me and tell me I have to take the post down as my sister has had over 30 people unfriend her, I've also had messages from my sister that where not so nice. my mum has told me that I'm now ruining my sisters life. AITA?edit 1 I've seen no proof of my sisters claims besides her word. and from what the screenshots showed she absolutely hated the fact that he was bi and wanted nothing to do with him."
237,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my boyfriend's co-worker that we're not married?,25751,la3xpq,3843,"I've been with Boyfriend for about 5 years. We live together. He does not want to get married, which I'm fine with now, but it was a point of contention early on in our relationship.Boyfriend was talking to Co-worker on zoom when I brought him some coffee. Co-worker said something like ""so this is the lovely wife I've heard so much about"". I said something like ""thanks but we're not married"". He said ""oh, Boyfriend always calls you his wife"", and then introduced himself, I introduced myself, then ended the conversation and left as quickly I could while still being polite because both Boyfriend and Co-worker were giving me a weird vibe.A little while later, Boyfriend came out of the office and asked ""what was that?"". I didn't know what he meant so I asked ""what was what?"". Boyfriend then said that there was absolutely no need for me to correct Co-worker and that it's better if people think I'm his wife. I said I'm not his wife, I'm his girlfriend, and he never told me that he told other people that I'm his wife.This somehow becomes an argument, with my side being that Boyfriend never told me that his co-workers think we're married, and Boyfriend's side being that I should have figured that being called his wife indicated that Co-worker thought I was his wife and I shouldn't have corrected him, and when I said I thought he'd just made an assumption, Boyfriend said that wasn't the point, the point was that there was no need to correct him, that it was rude, and that it make Boyfriend look like a dickhead.He then said that the solution to this is that when he next has a video call with Co-worker, he wants me to come in again, strike up a conversation, and say that I was messing with him, and that Boyfriend is actually Husband and us not being married is an inside joke I thought Co-worker was in on.I then said that was the dumbest fucking plan he'd ever come up with, and ""no fucking way am I doing that"", and he said I was being an arsehole, that I got him into this, and now I have to bail him out.AITA?Update: We talked. He's fucking a (female) co-worker. Apparently ""I can't leave my wife for you"" sounds better than ""I can't leave my girlfriend for you"". So now he's going to have to tell people we've divorced."
238,Not the A-hole,"AITA for asking for pocket money because ""I am a kid too""",25752,d2mewl,2103,"I am 19F, have a little brother who is 8, and living with my parents at the moment. I am still studying so I cannot pay rent yet, but I do earn my own pocket money from part-time jobs.My father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. They have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. That plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. I had been arranged to join the kids' group, when I tried to protest they insist that I am a ""kid"" too, so I just had to submit to my fate. Clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they ""adults"" get out and enjoy their reunion.So I spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. That includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to Science Park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an ""adult"" when needed. To be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when I sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(I admit, I am not really babysitter material). The kids seem to like me, so I guess it went well too. However, I still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. When my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. Almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. Now, I don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes I can easily earn in a few hours, but I am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, I was skipped for being an ""adult"" this time.I put on the biggest smile I and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. They were a little taken aback. I said as sweetly as I could that I deserve pocket money too for being a ""kid"", they said so themselves. In all awkwardness I got my pocket money. Needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.I got the biggest shit from my parents after they left. In their words, I am a major AH to have deliberately made my parents lose face, and so on and so forth. AITA?"
239,Not the A-hole,AITA for turning off the wifi when my husband camps in the bathroom for extended lengths of time.,25751,elpvjj,4540,"My husband and I are the parents of twins who are less than a year old. Anytime my husband SHOULD be doing something with the children ( it's his turn for a diaper, a bottle, even just soothing a fussy newborn) he ALWAYS goes to the bathroom first. We are both on maternity / paternity leave currently.My husband is on medication that makes him spend a lot of time in the bathroom about an hour after a meal. It's a medication he has been on and off several times over the past year. He is never on it for more than a few weeks, and it does not effect him all the time, but he always claims that is why he is in the bathroom. ( I did ask, the doctor didnt say it was impossible, but highly unlikely. Doc wanted him to come in for a checkup if this was the case and husband said oh it's not THAT bad and refuses to go in )I would rather let him use the restroom first than have to put down a baby mid task, but over the past couple months he has been spending more and more time in there. He always takes his phone. He is always watching youtube. His average session is 25 minutes in there, often longer, rarely shorter.It's the most frustrating when it comes time to feed them ( one of the twins needs to be held specifically for health reasons, so I can not double feed ) because we will get up, I will warm up bottles, change one baby bum, get the first one fed, burped, and laid down in their crib, get the other baby changed and be setteling down to feed baby number two before he can be bothered to emerge and figure out why one child has been screaming because they had to watch their sibling eat l, and then the other when cry when they dont get to cuddle at all because I have to immediately set them down to feed the hysterically sobbing child. Yesterday was a week and a half sence I started truly keeping track, and he, only twice in 10 days, not ditched me to go camp out in the bathroom and let me finish %80 of the childcare.Today I started a new rule. If he is in the bathroom for more than 10 minutes, I flip the wifi off. He has not spend more than 15 minutes in the bathroom at a stretch today, but is extremely upset. I feel like the fact that without the wifi his uncontrollable toilet issue cleared up rather quickly proves why it needs to be done, but he feels I am being unreasonable, and I need to make sure sleep deprivation isnt makeing me an asshole.TLDR: AITA for turning off the wifi when my husband is in the bathroom for extended periods of time, avoiding domestic and fatherly duties.Edit: to answer questions that people have been asking.Yes, I have talked to him about this. 10 days ago we had a conversation about the situation, and he denied how long hes been spending in the bathroom. This conversation is also the one where I proposed he see a doctor.Yes he has down time. He spends a good deal of time working on his car and plahs diablo about 8 hours straight every day. He spends most of his time on the other side of the house on his PC in his office."

241,Not the A-hole,"AITA for rejecting the role of ""cool aunt"" because it was really more like unpaid babysitter?",25718,i62p53,2369,"My sister and I have always been very different. Growing up, she was your stereotypical nerdy/geeky girl. Very into sci-fi/fantasy, video games, etc. She bonded a lot with my parents over it, because they are the same.I always felt kind of ""different"" from the others because I'm not very ""geeky"" and while I did my best to fit in (Star Wars movies, Harry Potter, etc), I took my first opportunity to leave the area for school. I went to FIT and got a degree in fashion design.  I always loved making my own clothes. To frame it one way... I made my prom dress from my own pattern, and my family smiled politely. My sister threw together a Harry Potter costume and the picture is hanging on the walls.Well, sis had kids a while back. I sent polite gifts, including a quilt to be handed down. Sis received them warmly, but I found out she doesn't use the quilt because the room is ""Harry Potter"" themed.Due to COVID, I ended up moving back closer to home into a condo I'd been renting out (tenants were not evicted or anything). Once Sis found out, she got really excited and started making all kinds of plans. I was thrilled because I thought *she* wanted to spend more time with me.Except the plans were like... I take the kids to the zoo, I take them to the park, I take them for ice cream, the aquarium, etc, so Sis can have some time to herself and relax, play video games, etc. I inquired about when she and I would spend time together, and she actually said ""It's not like we have anything in common we can do together.""I was really hurt by this, and declined her requests for me to basically babysit her kids. She asked me why, and didn't I want to be the Cool Aunt, and this is where I think I'm the asshole.I said ""I don't know, it's not like I have anything in common with them that we can do together. Sounds like you want an unpaid babysitter.""She was shocked and went stomping to Mom and Dad, who immediately took her side and told me that I should be thankful to spend time with the kids. I said why, it's not like anyone in the family has *ever* made it a point to spend time with me doing something *I'd* enjoy. She told me that if I'd tried harder to be more like there rest of them, instead of ""chasing popularity and doing my nails"" maybe I would have more in common with them.I'm lost now, because on the one hand, I don't think I was wrong to decline being a free sitter for my sister. But maybe my Mom is right and I've been a shitty member of the family because I couldn't just get into Star Wars and all that.**EDIT:** I just wanted to chime in and say that Star Wars & Harry Potter aren't the only geeky/nerdy things they like, they were just the things that popped into my head. I remember back when we were in high school, my sister laughed in my face because I didn't enjoy the Sabriel books and she told me they were ""too advanced"" for me to understand. She found me reading the California Diaries (offshoot of Babysitters Club books) and laughed in my face again because they were ""dumb books for vapid little girls.""**EDIT 2:** One thing I'm curious about is why so many people are telling me, first thing, in their comments, that they're geeky/nerdy! Why do you think that makes things different? "

243,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my husband to check on me while playing video games?,25533,hnn6gj,2261,"My husband is an avid computer gamer - mostly WoW-type games. Approximately five nights of the week, he'll play games online from the time that our son goes to bed at 8:00 or 8:30 to about 12:30, so at least four continuous hours. That in itself is not at all an issue for our relationship. He spends plenty of time with me and our son, and I have my own hobbies that he isn't interested in that I engage in when he's online.A few nights ago I was doing laundry while he was playing online, and I stepped on a toy that my son had left on the basement stairs. I fell pretty hard and dropped the basket. Luckily because of the way my weight was shifted I fell backwards rather than forwards, resulting in a bruise on my butt but I was otherwise fine. The laundry basket clattered down the stairs, ricocheted off some basement furniture, shot laundry everywhere. It was a huge racket. It woke up my son. My husband, who had his headphones on, heard literally nothing.It dawned on me that if something really bad happened to me, my husband wouldn't know about it for potentially four hours - like what if I broke my leg falling down the stairs? So I asked if he would be willing, for my peace of mind, to just pop out of his office at the mid-point each night just to check on me. Like literally, just say hi and go back to gaming. He thinks this is a huge overreaction and a waste of time. I know for a fact that he isn't actively playing the entire time and he sometimes takes breaks to go to the bathroom or get a snack or whatever, so how is this different? AITA?"

It has 3 bedrooms, a yard and is just what I need right now. I'm single and have 2 dogs.  My sister is 34, has 3 children and lives in a 2 bedroom apartment. Lately, she's been talking about how  such a tiny living space is not enough for the four of them. When she got to know about the house I had bought, she became very upset and told me I was being ""wasteful"" as I'm single and don't have kids and  therefor don't need such a big space. I reminded her that what I do with my hard earned money is none  of her business. She went on to complain to our mother about how ""selfish"" I was being. Yesterday evening, I got a call from my mom telling me I should let my sister and her kids move into the house. MY house.I told her that no one was going to live in the house that I paid for but me, and that extra space would be great for my dogs to play in. My mom also got very upset with me and told me I was being unreasonable.  That my sister's kids are growing and need the space more than my dogs.  I offered to help my sister out financially  so she could rent a bigger place. My mom got my sister on the phone who shot down the idea, telling me I *needed* to let her and her kids live in my house. When I refused again, she very generously suggested a ""compromise"". I could live in the house with her and her kids and would not have to find somewhere else to live. She said this as if she was doing me a favor. I told her she had lost her mind and hung up. Am I the asshole, or is she? I know my sister is struggling financially but this kind of entitlement is ridiculous."

He is has a group of friends in the neighborhood that he always hangs out with, they all enjoy skating and longboarding and stuff so that's what they're doing most of the time. The boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their parents are hella weird. They have a groupchat where they're secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. My mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it's honestly ridiculous they'll sent texts like ""I saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago"" ""They were in our garden 5 minutes ago I think now they're headed to the skate park"". I think it's hilarious because our neighborhood isn't dangerous at all.One of the moms in the chat is especially annoying because she keeps calling our house and asking if her son 'Jake' is there. We once were put in a groupchat together for a church project and since then she has my number and texts me all the time asking about the boys, because my mom won't respond. Now yesterday I was home alone at about 2pm because my mom was at work and my siblings were out. Jakes mom had called my phone two times but I didn't answer cause she was annoying me. My boyfriend came over and we were just sorta chilling in the living room talking and listening to music. We were sitting on the couch and started to kiss and make out a bit. It was all nice and peaceful and suddenly I hear a really loud knock. It really made us jump because it was just so sudden. I turn to look and there's Jakes freakin mom outside, knocking at the window. I nearly hit the ceiling I was so angry. I go outside and she's all like blah blah sorry to interrupt I just wanted to ask because I haven't seen Jake in almost two hours ect.ect. Apparently we didn't hear the doorbell because of the music so she just walked around the house to investigate and look in the windows. I really blew up at her saying that she's a weirdo who stalks her son everywhere and a freak to look in other peoples windows. I also asked her if her obsessive stalking was the reason for her divorce which probably went a little to far.My boyfriend thought I was justified and my brother thought it was funny but my mom is mad at me because all the other parents are now blowing up her phone. She also thinks I shouldn't have said that stuff about the divorce.  I feel sorry for putting my mom in this position but I feel like someone needed to tell that lady how annoying her behavior is."
246,Not the A-hole,AITA For walking out of my father's funeral?,25469,gs4smm,993,"Thowaway account for obvious reasons.Important info:- I'm a caucasian F, early 30's. Married to a lovely mixed M and we have a 2yr old.- I've cut contact with my family about 5yrs ago, mostly due to my mother's narcissistic behaviour and her being pretty darn racist (she hated me dating my now husband), and the rest of my family condoning the crap she put us up with. - Most of my other relatives cut ties withwith my family before I was born or shortly after, I'm thinking it's once again because of my mother. The only one that kept in touch was one aunt, from my father's side.This happened yesterday.Last friday I got a call from my aunt that my dad got into an accident 2 days prior and didn't make it (he died on impact apparently). She asked me if I'd heard anything from my family, to which I replied 'no' (important to know that I've been using the same cellphone number and email since I was 18 or so). She figured they forgot and asked me if I wanted to come to the funeral. After a few minutes of thinking I told her I'd come if my family was okay with it and if SHE wanted me to, I explained to her that I wouldn't be going for myself or my father/family, just to support her. She said she'd want me there as she'd have no other support and called me later to tell me my family was okay with me coming.So, yesterday was the day of the funeral. The past few days I did not hear a single thing from my family. When I got to the location my family members jumped right on top of me, telling me how happy they were that I came/that we should go to dinner/told me all kinds of stories about thing that happened the last 5yrs........they basically acted like those 5yrs didn't happed and we weren't there for a funeral. I know grieve does things to people, so I let it slide and played along, but it made me feel really uneasy and I made sure not to give any details about my own family or job, as they know nothing about that and I wanted to keep it that way as it was not the time and place for an argument about my husband.During the ceremony they insisted I sat next to my mother. Everything started out okay, but when it was time for speeches, my family insisted I'd speak. I quietly told them no, that I had nothing prepared, but they didn't accept it. So I got up and quickly said 'he'll be missed' and sat down again. They visibly were not happy with me and my mother started shouting at me, telling me I was a worthless bitch, that I'd always treated them without any respect and that I was a bicth for not giving an actual speech about how amazing my father was in front of the +150 people that had shown up.So, I looked at her for a few seconds, mostly trying to figure out wth just happened..........stood up, told her to enjoy the rest of her day and walked out.My husband told me I did the right thing and he was proud of me for keeping my cool instead of starting a shouting match, so is my aunt........but I've been bombarded with messages from people that say I went too far.

247,Not the A-hole,AITA for propositioning a girl in the gym?,25463,bgyfr0,1705,"Please hear me out before you judge because while I did say what you’re thinking I didn’t say it in the way you’re thinking.The gym I go to is very small. Not a lot of machines and not a lot of patrons. This means working out fairly close to people even if you don’t mean to. Yesterday I (23 f if it makes a difference) was on the extended leg press doing my thing when a girl and her boyfriend began working out on the machine beside me. (One would do a set while the other waited beside them) The girl looked at me, rolled her eyes and muttered to her boyfriend “Ugh I hate girls who only come to the gym to get a big ass.”I shrugged her off, and kept doing my thing. I was on the assisted pull up machine doing an exercise where you put one foot on the pad and push downwards (apologies for not knowing the name, my trainer showed me it so I’m not entirely sure if it’s an actual well known exercise) The same girl looks at me, tuts and says to her bf “Look there she goes again, and her forms terrible.” Which is possibly true but she pissed me off.At this point I call her out. I said “Oi, you.” She immediately looked like she shit herself and ignored me. So I called her out again specifically “You in the purple top.” She turned round and asked what I wanted. The following conversation happens:Me Do you want to fuck me?Her: What?!Me: I said do you want to fuck me?Her: What the fuck is wrong with you?Me: Well you keep staring at me, so I’m assuming you either want to fuck me or fight me, so which is it?She went bright red, grabbed her boyfriends arm and went to the changing rooms. I carried on with my workout and didn’t see them again.When I told my friend what happened, he said I acted like a dick and that as a woman I should know how much it sucks to be objectified in the gym. He also pointed out that I embarrassed her in front of everyone and ruined her and her bfs work out. My defence is she should also know how much it sucks to make people make disparaging comments about you in the gym and that she shouldn’t talk shit if she doesn’t want called out on it.I’ll admit that I’m a pretty confrontational person and I could have reacted better but I also think she should mind her own business."
248,Not the A-hole,AITA for forcing a confession out of my wife about spying on my kids therapy sessions,25398,gy8z0s,1808,"So for those that don’t know, I have two children M20 and F19 and ever since the world went to hell, I got them therapy sessions at their requests because they said that this was taking a huge toll on them.On Wednesday when my daughter went to attend the zoom session my wife had left to go take a nap. I didn't think much of it, but she came back exactly 3 hours later after both of them finished looking sad. Today the same thing happened and when I went to wake her up for dinner today I found her watching a recording of my daughter’s session. I lost it. That conversation was supposed I will be private we had promised our kids that we will respect their privacy and do our best to help them when they need it.I made her confess to our kids and told her. They were heartbroken and they hate her. She claims that it’s my fault but she dug her own grave. Both of them feel betrayed and don't want anything to do with their mother. So Reddit am I the asshole for forcing a confession??Edit: Thank you for the Platinum award strangerEdit2: Thank you for the Silver award strangerI really do appreciate both of themEdit3: Thank you guys for the overwhelming support. I really do love this subreddit.Edit4: Thank you for the gold kind strangerEdit5: For the people wondering about her intention for spying on the kids. She hasn’t said a word about it. Just got up and left saying that “I don’t need to take this shit”Minor update:Hey so many of you wanted an update, but it’s too soon to tell what will actually happen.As of now my soon to be ex-wife is staying at a friends house. I did receive some calls from her and her friends about how I’m an asshole but after I explained everything to her friends they apologised and sided with me.My kids do want a divorce but I feel as tho she has already put that plan into motion. I’m not too worry as I am able to afford better lawyers than her. My kids are actually grateful that I did what I did because they now realised that their mom is a control freak. Funny enough a friend had found the post after a mutual friend told them and showed it to my wife.Sorry if this is short, but this is all I have as of right now."
249,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my husband he is either married to me or his co-worker?,25381,jki2fy,2220,"My (37f) husband (40m) has been working at his company for 10 years as a maintenance supervisor. About a year ago they hired Tabitha\* to work in their accounting department. Since the day she first started working there, she has had an infatuation with my husband that is now becoming unprofessional and inappropriate.This started when the heat went out in her office. My husband's job as supervisor is to assign tasks to his employees, however, she is never satisfied with the work they do, even though he says that they do great work, so she demands he work on her office. She constantly calls him on his work phone for mundane things (carpet is loose in a corner, loose screw on her coat hook) and he goes and fixes them without issue. Last year when we went to the company Christmas party (pre-plague times) she was very flirty with him, constantly grabbed his hand. When he introduced us she just grinned at my and said ""look there's Peter,"" and grabbed his hand and walked away. When we sat at the table she damn near pushed me out of my seat to sit next to him, and my husband told her to get up that it was my seat. She walked off in a huff, and when she saw me in the restroom she shoved past me. I told my husband what happened and he said it was fine, that she was harmless. I told him that she was not fine, and that she clearly had feelings for him and she was acting like a jealous girlfriend. The past few weeks this has ramped up to an astonishing level of inappropriate. She recently moved into a new house and my husband and some of the other guys from work helped her move and put things together. He gave her his personal cell phone number, and she has been calling and texting non-stop about things she needs help with. Multiple times a day at all hours of the day and night she will call and text him for help. Last night at 2:00AM she called about her heat not working right. My husband said he would go over and look at it after work. I broke down. I told him he was not going, that she could call a technician like everyone else, and that he is not her personal maintenance man. I told him very clearly that she has feelings for him and he is so dense he can't see it. I told him that while it is nice to help on occasion, she calls him all the time asking for help with things that she can do on her own (move boxes/furniture) or pay to have a repair person come and fix. I told him that once he gave out his personal phone number that he crossed a line, and I am not comfortable with it. He said that this will most likely be an easy fix and it won't take long, so I cried and told him that he can either to be married to me, or married to her, but I wasn't going to be the third wheel in my own marriage. He says he does not have feelings for her and that I am overreacting to him just wanting to help a friend. I feel otherwise.AITA?"
250,Not the A-hole,AITA for being upset and leaving when my sister in law stole my pregnancy announcement?,25337,ivrh66,2800,"[UPDATE ONE]( [UPDATE TWO]( I (36f) found out that I am pregnant. I am overjoyed as I have always wanted a child of my own. I focused on my career in my life and since I am single, I wasn’t sure if having a baby would ever happen.I was excited to tell my family the big news. My older sister has one child, my nephew (7m). My brother is married but he and his wife have made it very clear they will always be child free.Last night we had a family dinner and I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to share the news. Since this will be my only child I wanted to make it special and I also wanted to involve my nephew.I got a shirt that read “this is what an awesome big cousin looks like”. I slipped away with my nephew before dinner and had a special moment with him while I told him he was going to have a cousin. My nephew was very excited and put on the shirt. He put his sweater on over it and I told him he could take the sweater off whenever he wanted at dinner.In the middle of dinner he took off the sweater and waited for someone to notice. Soon my sister jumped up and excitedly screamed when she saw the shirt.They all then immediately assumed it was my sister in law. I wasn’t hurt my them assuming this and I kind of expected it because she is married.I was hurt because my sister in law didn’t try to correct them. She just went along with it and began to rub her flat belly while laughing. I must have looked completely hurt because my mother yelled at me to stop being rude and to congratulate them.I tried to explain that I was the one who gave my nephew the shirt. They all didn’t even hear me and just continued to fawn over my sister in law. My brother stood frozen in shock just asking his wife if she was serious.I got up and went home. I received multiple texts at this point from them telling me what an asshole I am for making this about me. They said things like it wasn’t my sister in laws fault that I was jealous. I didn’t reply to anything and just cried myself to sleep.This morning my sister in law must have finally let it slip that she is not pregnant. They have now all called me to apologize saying that they just got caught up in the moment.They said I shouldn’t have left the dinner and that it’s my fault I wasn’t clear enough that I was the one who is pregnant. My mom said I could have a redo dinner so I can get it right and they will all act surprised. My sister in law sent me a message that said that the way I chose to announce was how she wanted to do it if she ever got pregnant. She said that since she is not ever having a child that she just wanted to experience what the moment would be like. She also said I can have my chance at the redo dinner. I told them no and that I will not be doing a redo. Every single person has now told me I am being selfish and an asshole because I won’t let them make it right.To me there’s no fixing this. I will eventually forgive them but I don’t want to do a second announcement so they feel better.AITA?"
251,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my new neighbours that I've been trapped in a basement for a week after she told me not to check my mail box on weekends?,25301,dh6wvr,1477,"I've been away since Thursday, house sitting for my mum, and it's currently Sunday afternoon where I live.  Here, mail doesn't deliver on weekends, they only do that Monday to Friday, which means I had 2 days worth of mail in my mailbox. My 30 something year old neighbours moved in on Friday when I wasn't here, and she was in her front yard when I was collecting my mail. She goes ""Don't check your mailbox on weekends. They don't deliver on weekends. So don't check it."" (In a rude Karen voice, if you know then you know.) Already, I know we're not going to have a good neighbour relationship, and I'm hungover and can't be bothered dealing with her shit, so I said ""I know, it's just I've been kidnapped in the basement for a week so I had to check the mailbox."" I don't have a basement, barely anyone does in my country. She seemed shocked, but it was an obvious joke with my overly sarcastic tone. Then we both went inside and that was that. About 25 minutes later, the police knocked on the door thinking I was held captive in my basement which I don't have, so I explained to them what I had said and they just laughed and left.Just before, I was putting rubbish in the bin and she came out and called me a c*nt for making her think I was kidnappedAITA?Edit: spellingEdit 2: Thanks for your judgement everyone. I honestly thought it was going to have a different outcome because I felt horrible after the police arrived, like what I said was incredibly wrong of me (which it is, don’t do what I did). But I’m disabling reply notificationsAlso, I am Australian"
252,Not the A-hole,AITA for showing my boyfriend my used sanitary towel in an argument?,25283,fbv7ty,3682,"Title sounds gross I know, maybe it is a bit gross.Background: me (F23) and boyfriend (m22) have been together for 6 months, good relationship, healthy sex life that we talk about a lot and communicate our needs etc. A month ago I had the implant fitted (contreception) which has given me weird frequent periods. The doctor told me they should go back to normal in a few months and to wait it out, which I'm doing because I like the convenience of the implant. English isn't my first language so sorry for any bad writing.We were in bed yesterday night watching TV and he went to initiate sex. I moved his hand away and said I was still on my period. My period had been going for about a week now so we'd not had sex in that time. Then my boyfriend made a really loud dramatic sigh and moved away from me. I said 'sorry, I can't help my periods.'He replied 'yeah sure.' I said what was that suppose to mean? He wouldn't give me a straight answer and kept saying 'whatever'.We didn't talk for a while and kept watching TV in silence. Then he said 'if you don't want to have sex you can just say you know.'I was kind of pissed off at this because I felt like he was saying I was faking being on my period. I told him I really was still on my period. He said no periods last longer than a week, and I told him that the doctor had said this was normal for some people on the implant at first and it will settle.He told me that he didn't believe me and so I called him an idiot (which wasn't nice I know). He then started ranting that how could I call him an idiot when I was clearly a liar who must be cheating on him and getting sex elsewhere which is why I am lying about my periods. I couldn't believe he was saying this because he's never freaked out on me like this. Cheating has also never ever been mentioned in our relationship ever so I don't know where this came from. It annoyed me so much that I got out of bed and pulled my trousers and pants down so he could see my sanitary towel that was bloody and shouted Could I fake this??He screamed that I was fucking disgusting and left the room. I started laughing because of the ridiculous of the situation and that pissed him off more, as he grabbed his keys and stormed out of the house.I tried to text him but he ignored me, so I left him to it as I was pretty annoyed by his behaviour. I then got a text a few hours later around 11pm from his sister saying he had gone to his mom and dad's house and told his sister what happened. She said what I had done was really disgusting and he's refusing to come back unless I apologise. I told my friend what happened and she said he was being an idiot but that I also needed to apologise because what I did was 'abhorrent'.I'm annoyed with what he did but also think it was pretty gross of me to do that. I don't really know why I did it it was just a spur of the moment thing. So AITA?Edit: Just wanted to offer an update. This has really changed my perspective on things. I think I was so thinking about the sanitary towel thing that I hadn't really realised how bad his behaviour was. His mom actually sent me a message on facebook saying what I did was disgusting and really abnormal and that she doesn't think me and my boyfriend should date anymore. I can't believe his mom is messaging me about this. I blocked her and messaged him that he needs to come and pick up his stuff that he's left at mine. Luckily it isn't much. He hasn't replied but I saw that he has shared a post on facebook about women being crazy. So I guess we're done.Thanks to everyone who took the time to respond. And sorry to everyone else who is dealing with annoying periods due to controception! It sucks!"
253,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my roommates gf that she's not woke if she's wrong,25254,lltqwg,2560,"**Edit: Whoa, I didn't expect this post to get huge. Thanks for all the feedback & opinions, everyone (even the ones who think this is fake. I sincerely hope you never meet someone like Anna in your life).** **Just some clarifications to clear the air:**1. **Why did I write this post? I've faced many Anna's in my life, but my comments about how its inappropriate has always been shut down (i.e., you're too sensitive/ they're just trying to be nice/ you're not being welcoming) by others (in other similar situations). It's confusing/ distressing, but I feel like Anna really hit my limit & I wanted to make sure that I'm not TA**2. **Is Anna white? She's of mixed heritage (Caucasian & African American). I personally feel like it added another sensitive layer in this entire mix & indirectly goes back to the point above**3. **Did I talk to her about this entire thing? I moved out of SEA to get rid of that 'you're not Chinese enough' mentality (I faced that from my own countrymen multiple times) & I don't celebrate Lunar New Year (thanks to those who recommended that term) outside of my home country for personal reasons (my family sucks & I don't have good memories attached to that holiday). I didn't think I would need to justify/ defend myself** ***again.*** **As for the separate incidences, not really (& that's my fault). I just told her don't do that again cause I don't like it. I should have explained to her why, & I accept responsibility for that**4. **How did she confuse kabuki masks & think hell notes were decoration? Based on what her bf said, she went to some Chinese website that sells everything & the translation was whacky so she just thought it was all the same**5. **The entire organ meat incident: she didn't expect me & SO to eat them raw. She expected SO & I to cook it cause she's seen me cook some herbal soups before (non had organ meat though)****Hope that clarifies things for everyone!**Husband (28M) & I (25F) are ethnically Chinese from a SEA country living overseas. We rent a house with SO's college friend who moved his gf (Anna) in during lockdown & she's been with us ever since (with landlord's permission & she pays her share of bills). They're not Asians, which matters.Anna was initially nice, but started acting very weirdly a month after she moved in:1. Telling SO & I that we can practice our 'real' religion (which apparently is Buddhism, not Christianity even though SO & I come from Christian families). She even bought incense (which gives me migraines) & a random Buddha statue. We politely explained to her that we're not Buddhists, but she continued to insist & promised that she didn't mind.2. Telling SO & I that we can speak our 'real' language cause she overheard SO's family talking to us in a mix of English & Cantonese. I explained to her that I can't speak Cantonese (SO can) even though I can understand it. She was, for some reason, really disappointed in me & said that I was throwing my heritage away. Plot twist: my own father is only comfortable speaking English.3. Buying raw internal organs for SO & I to cook, even though we don't eat those. I told her we don't eat that (not our thing), & she was again disappointed. She told us she read that there were lots of nice recipes & maybe we haven't found the right one to remind us of home. SO told her he's never eaten it ever in his life, & I've never liked it. She was really upset, but had to toss it since no one was gonna eat itChinese New Year was when things got really really weird. She started ordering 'decorations'. I wouldn't mind, but she had ordered hell notes (the ones burned for deceased ancestors). I immediately told her to stop pasting them all over the walls because they were weirding me out. She ordered banners with SO & my name on it (some bastardisation of our *legal* English names) but they were written on white banners (again, for deceased people). I told her to please take it down. She got upset (again), but then ordered kabuki masks. I told her that those masks were not Chinese, & she just snapped. She started yelling at me that I should be helping her & not critiquing what she was doing. I told her:1. She never asked2. CNY is not a big deal to me, so I wasn't planning on decorating but if she had asked, I would have helped3. She never askedI told her I don't understand her fixation with us. She said she wanted to surprise me & SO, that we've been so 'colonised' we've forgotten our roots, & that we should be embracing our culture. I told her it was a nice gesture, but she needs to stop forcing stereotypes down our throats. She could have just asked & she's not being woke when she's getting everything wrong.She burst into tears & brought in her bf. He understood where I was coming from, but thought I could have been nicer. SO stands by me, & now things have been tense, but I've been tolerating this for a while now & it was getting on my nerves."
254,Not the A-hole,AITA for not speaking to my parents again after they put my cat down,25205,fdyy9z,2292,"For context: I'm 28, the vets office is literally 10 minutes away.I had them take him because I have two herniated disks and can't carry the carrier and open the multiple doors and hold the carrier without fear of dropping it.  I thought he had a little cold with the only reasoning being that his ears felt a little warm, he wasn't eating as much as he normally does and he was due for his shots anyway. So I cooked dinner for all of us while they took him to the vet on my dime. I called them after an hour and asked how things were going and my father told me everything was good and he had a little fever. Fast forward another hour, they come back and let themselves in and I open the door to my mother sobbing and my father slinking in the corner. Turns out the vet found a large mass on his Kidney and suspected it was stage 3-4 cancer. So my parents, without calling me, had him put down to ""spare my feelings"".I told them both to leave and that I never wanted to speak to them again. That it wasn't their decision to make and they should have called and told me the situation so I could at the very least say good bye and be with him. That by failing to tell me, they stole an opportunity for any closure I could have. I raised that cat from a feral kitten with his mother and his brother from the time he had his eye's open. He was only 10.I'm equally heart broken and furious and they can't seem to understand why. They proceeded to berate and belittle me, going as far as to say I wasn't sad, just angry and that I was: ""ruining a beautiful and tragic moment"" and that it was my fault because I didn't go with them. Edit: As just to be clear the never wanting to see them again bit was after this attempt to make me feel bad for being angry.Am I the asshole here?Edit: I'm turning off reply notifications. 99% of you can form a reasonable response, NTA/YTA/ETA. I'm just sick of the ""YTA because it was just a cat"" people, who are clearly miserable assholes themselves. I hope they never have a pet for that pet's sake."
255,Not the A-hole,AITA for pushing off a girl my lap and making her cry?,25202,i1z11d,1395,"I \[19M\] just started dating a girl I really, really like a couple months ago. I was hanging out with my friend (I'll call Joe\] who is also 19, and has a crush on this girl ""Sarah"" \[18F\]. Anyway, we were all hanging out and there were no more seats in the car, so I suggested she sit on Joe's lap, but she chose to sit on mine, so I put a jacket on my lap so she wasn't directly on me. I felt really uncomfortable because she's just sitting her bony ass on me and I have a girlfriend, who she knows I have.Anyway, when we stopped to get gas I made her sit on my friend's lap instead and she started to full on cry because I didn't want her to sit on me and I had put a jacket. I felt awkward and bad for my friend who likes her and she was just crying on his lap and said I was a jerk.She ended up texting me saying we have to talk about us and I said, ""what are you talking about 'us?'"" and she said that I was giving her mixed signals because she thought there was something between us. I said nope, I'm like this with all my friends, and she said I thought you were like that with Joe as a joke because he's just your friend but me it's because you liked me, and that it made her confused because she knows I have a girlfriend. I said ""nope, I'm like that with everyone"" and told her I'm happy with my girlfriend and I don't want to date her. She called me an asshole and I haven't seen her since. Her best friend texted me and said I was being an asshole. I told my girlfriend \[19F\] against my friends wishes (who are also her friends, not Sarah, but Joe is) and she laughed and said that boys are so oblivious and that she could tell Sarah had a crush on me but she trusted me to make the right choices. Basically, she didn't really care, just thought Sarah was kind of crappy for trying to go after a guy with a girlfriend.So, AITA? I legit didn't really know she had a crush on me. It kind of dawned on me that night. I never pursued her. I slept over her house once because I was too drunk to drive but I slept on the floor and didn't let her near me, and I would mention my girlfriend a lot because I'm excited about dating her. Apparently she thought I liked her because she once asked me if I would join her art club and I said sure. I don't understand girls. I really don't.Update: Wow, THIS BLEW UP! Sarah and Joe ended up hanging out on their own, apparently, and she ended up trashing me, saying I was an asshole, how she liked me, etc. Joe told me privately that he knew she had a crush on me but wanted to see what I would do/enjoy the show because he thought the drama was funny. She ended up texting me again and saying how I was a jerk and basically the friendship imploded. The last thing she said was that she wasn't sorry and I said ""well I can be sorry for the both of us."" Joe still has a crush on her and I'm sure he's still trying to date her. But, that's pretty much it for that. My girlfriend loves all the comments calling her a keeper and has found the entire situation hilarious. She really is a keeper. Thanks, everyone! "
256,Not the A-hole,AITA for letting my nephew to call me mom?,25176,g9t0d6,2001,"Awhile back, my brother married a woman who had an 11 year old son named ""Billy"". A year later my SIL gave birth to a little girl. Two years later, she gave birth to a boy. Billy, who was 14 by this time, was treated like an outsider. My SIL and brother saw him as a burden who spoiled their picture perfect family. If you asked my SIL how many kids she had, she would say two. Billy started acting out. He got involved with a bad group of kids and started getting into trouble. He started failing all of his classes. He eventually got into drugs and was suspended from school. My brother and SIL were fed up with him.I asked my brother if Billy could spend the summer with me and my husband. We have a hobby farm and I thought maybe getting away from his life for awhile could help him some. Well, they were more than happy to get rid of him (my SIL's words). It was kind of rough the first few weeks. He had a lot of anger issues. But my husband kept his hands and mind busy doing work on the farm. And we both made sure that he knew he was loved and wanted. By August, he was a totally different kid. He wanted to keep living with us but my SIL insisted that he come home. After two months, he went back to his old ways due to his parents indifference. They ended up sending him back to us and he lived with us throughout high school. He ended up being an A/B student and kept with a really great group of kids. He got involved in baseball and got a scholarship to a local university. He's 22 now and is in his last year of school. He's engaged to a really great girl.When he was 16 he started calling me Mom and he started calling my husband Pops. He never really had much to do with his mom and he had nothing to do with my brother. He saw them on holidays when the whole family came over. His mom has tried to have a relationship with him the past few years but he has avoided her. On Christmas, SIL was over and for what ever reason, she opened my desk drawer and found a birthday card from Billy where he said ""To the best mom ever. Thanks for loving me and giving me a chance."" She was devastated. She ended up texting Billy, confronted him and asked him if she would be presented as mother of the groom at his wedding. He told her that he no longer considered her his mom and wasn't even sure if he wanted her at the wedding at all.My SIL is now insisting that I make it clear to Billy that I am not his mother and that he is not to refer to me as such. My brother is also very upset with me. Even my parents are pressuring me to do what SIL wants for the sake of peace. Honestly, I consider Billy to be my son. I count him in with all of my children. I feel like telling Billy not to present me as mother of the groom could possibly be misinterpreted as me saying that I don't feel like he's my son and I don't even want to take a chance of that happening. If he decides to present his real mom as mother of the groom, I will 110% support him. So AITA for not respecting my SIL's wishes?Edited to add: I have zero desire to tell Billy not to call me mom and I absolutely won't do it because I know it would destroy him and it would kill me. My SIL insists that by not doing it, I'm making it impossible for her to have a relationship with him and I'm being selfish. I have talked to Billy about it some. He doesn't like to talk about his mom at all. He basically just said that he doesn't see her as a mom and has for sure decided he doesn't want her at the wedding. I understand and respect that. Also, I just want to thank everyone who left such sweet comments. I've been so choked up reading them all."
257,Not the A-hole,AITA For siding with my brother and SIL over my parents?,25135,i0hwki,1398,"My brother and my SIL have been married for 6 years. I love them both dearly. They adopted a little girl about a year ago. My parents were happy about this too, at first. They got really angry when my brother and SIL announced recently that their daughter would be their only child and they do not want biological kids.My mom and dad lost their shit. They told my brother he *had* to get my SIL pregnant. He was the family's male heir and he would have to have a biological son to carry forward the family name. This makes no sense to me, nor my bro and SIL. It's not as if we're a family of European royalty. Who gives a fuck about the family name in this day and age? Well, my parents do apparently. They've been berating my brother and guilt tripping my sister in law, making her feel like she's taking something away from our family. On one occasion they actually suggested that my brother leave my SIL if she didn't want to get pregnant and have a son with another woman.What's even worse is that they've stopped paying attention to my niece. Earlier, they would call and talk to her almost everyday. But ever since they were told about my bro and SIL's decision, they've stopped calling her. This pisses me off and has deeply saddened my bro and SIL. The child is  3 years old and doesn't deserve this kind of treatment.Yesterday, when I called my brother, he seemed very upset. He told me that mom and dad had called him and they had talked about something unrelated. When he asked if they wanted to talk to their granddaughter, they said they'd talk to their *real* grandchild when my brother came to his senses and decided to give them one.I was angrier than I've been in a long time. I called my parents and unloaded on them. I told them how selfish and cruel they were being  and how dare they take out their anger on my niece, along with a lot of other things I can't even remember. My mom started crying as she's not used to being yelled at. I understand that yelling at them may have been a bit much, but I just can't believe how awful they are being towards a kid. So am I the asshole? Or are they?EDIT  : Some people have been wondering how my parents would act when I have kids. No need to worry about that since I won't be having any. I made this clear to my parents years ago and yes they threw a fit over this. "

I(28f) come from a very traditional Indian family. I left them when I came to USA for uni because I knew that if I accepted their help in paying my fees they would hold it against me later and I got a part time job along with the financial aid I was receiving. I maintained low contact and didn't visit them in person until I was 26, when they contacted me on my younger brother passing uni.For the last two years, I have visited them four times and each time they've been talking about marriage although I stated very clearly that I wasn't interested. They brought up kids and how finding guys willing to marry older women was hard. I said no problem because I'm child free and that I don't need/want them to find a guy for me.January this year, I went to visit them and they said that they had something 'special' for me and that I would absolutely love it. The day after I reached their home, they said they were throwing me a 'welcome home party'. I thought they were trying to fix our relationship and let it be.They invited a lot of people and it had obviously already been planned. An hour in, my parents introduced me to a man in his thirties(F) and his parents.So, next thing I know, F goes down on one knee and whips out a beautiful ring. I'm surprised and angry at my parents for still trying to control my life and putting me in such a situation.I said no, but then our parents began to push my buttons and I exploded. I called F, his parents and my parents low-lifes for trying to trick me and basically insulted their views, calling them misogynistic and disgusting.Told them to go f themselves and left. I packed my bags and went to stay at a hotel until it was time for my flight. My mom cried and begged me to stay and said that they had already paid for half of the dowry and ring. I stopped responding to my parent's calls and texts because I was done with them.My cousins and some old friends have been telling me that I was being unfair by being so rude to F and his parents. Thing is, they were in on it. They expected me to say yes and sent me a lot of insults when I refused to reconsider. They were humiliated and in their tiny group of small-minded people, my parents were being ostracized for raising a 'whore' of a daughter. F and his parents were also humiliated because they were rejected by a 'whore'. AITA for being so rude? I feel like I should've handled the situation more delicately, rather than blowing up at all of them.EDIT: Wow! I did not expect so many NTA's or responses. When I said that they were 'in on it' I meant that my parents had told them that I hadn't met the 'right guy' and that I would come around, which is why they kept trying. My parents expected me to surrender all my savings and money to F, live with F and his family in India, procreate with F three times and do all the housework when I can't even make a poached egg. About letting me go to college, I told them two weeks before leaving for it and lived at my friend's house with all my important documents, because I knew that they would do pretty much anything to keep me from going. They called my uni and said that I wouldn't be joining. Uni contacted me and I cleared it up. That's why I didn't talk to them and declined to let them pay.For those of you who told me to wear a faux ring- I'm engaged to my girlfriend of five years and my parents aren't getting an invite to the wedding. I knew that they'd ask me about it if they saw it and disapprove of anyone that wasn't Indian- let alone a female.Thank you for your responses and I am never talking to my parents again."
259,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling a woman an idiot when she refused listen to why my daughter isn't vaccinated?,25128,lj2pxa,1708,"My (20f) 2yo daughter has had a heart transplant due to CHD and is severely immune compromised, as a result she cannot recieve live virus vaccines.I'm in a young mom's group on Facebook and the topic of daycares and being a SAHM came up. I said my boyfriend is the breadwinner and I stay at home with our daughter because I can't risk sending her to a daycare as she's not vaccinated. One woman, who is the same age as me with a newborn, started off, she's a new member, all the other women already know of my daughters medical history. She started calling me names and said I don't belong here if I'm so anti-vax. I told her my daughter is a transplant patient and can't be vaccinated. She just told me stop making excuses.I said, ""you're an absolute idiot, if you even looked at my profile for a second you'd know that I'm an advocate for vaccines and if you did a bit of research you'd know that giving someone who is severely compromised a live virus vaccine is a bad idea.""She was clearly very upset, she posted a rant about me onto the group and a few of the members said I was an asshole for calling her an idiot.AITA?Edit: If I could vaccinate my daughter or if I was confident every parent who sends there child to a daycare vaccinates their child, I would send her to one so I can work.Edit 2: I am not talking about the covid vaccine here"
260,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling my parents assholes for what they did to my birthday,25127,kjoql2,3209,"I (21f) was one of those kids who was born on Christmas Day. Which I wouldn’t have minded at all if my parents treated this normally for example my friends boyfriend was also born on Christmas and he said his parents would do his birthday in the morning and Christmas in the afternoon and I wouldn’t have minded that at all. However my parents said it was greedy to have two celebrations on one day so I had to choose between having Christmas with everyone else ( my family and extended family) or have my birthday on Boxing Day and not take part in Christmas ( I wouldn’t have any presents or the chocolates and stuff everyone else would, I wasn’t even allowed to help with the Christmas tree)  This was pretty shit, either I had Christmas with everyone and wasn’t even wished happy birthday and because we wouldn’t be at school I never got happy birthdays from my friends or I was completely left out during Christmas and had a birthday where everyone was still focused on Christmas. And if I chose birthday my parents would tell my extended family I didn’t want Christmas and if I chose Christmas they said I didn’t want my birthday so I didn’t get both from my extended family. It made my childhood absolute hell and ruined holidays for me. My first Christmas/ birthday away from home was probably the best day of my life. Well cuz of Covid my family were talking about doing a zoom call for Christmas and my mum said “ well I guess op gets to chose to be part of the Christmas call or we call her on Boxing Day for her birthday “ I don’t know why but I just blew up and called her an asshole and said they ruined my childhood. It’s not like they couldn’t afford it my family is probably in the top 1% of the country money wise and even so I could’ve still taken part in festivities and only had one present. But my brothers are calling me selfish and my auntie says I need to apologise. And it’s Christmas so I feel like I should.Edit:OH MY GOD. THANK YOU EVERYONE SO MUCH!! I went to bed last night and woke up to about a million notifications. I’m sorry but I don’t think I can get through everyone but I’m definitely trying to!! I’ve had the best birthday/Christmas!! My best friend got me a Nintendo switch!! And we’re going to have a huge gaming competition together and we got leftovers of kfc for lunch!! Thank you all so much for the birthday and Christmas wishes I feel so honoured ! I love you all!!!"
261,Not the A-hole,AITA for bringing a baby to a class??,25121,inme22,1607,"hi please let me know because i’m honestly not sure. for context, my university is completely online, I’m male and 20 years old. Okay, last week, a family emergency happened, and it required my aunt and uncle to leave their house at late night. I live close to them, and they have a baby that’s less than a year old. So, they called my parents to tell them about the emergency, and then called me. They asked if I could come into their house, take care of their baby, until they came back, and I was down with that. I’ve taken care of babies before, so, this wasn’t new to me.Took my stuff, and drove to their house, stayed with my cousin. Now, by the time my morning class comes about, my aunt and uncle haven’t shown up yet, which was within expected (they told me they’ll be back by one-two PM), and I had my baby cousin in my lap, setting up laptop for my morning class, and my cousin falls asleep, and I’m like OK. I can deal with this. A sleeping baby is the best kind of baby. Do not move them. Now, here’s the problem. I had a presentation to do, and so my video is off, as I’m preparing to give it, and the professor goes “OP, please turn on your camera.”“Uhh. I have a sleeping baby right now, so… is that okay with you?”“A sleeping baby?”“Yeah, there was a family emergency, so my cousin’s asleep on me right now, um… I don’t want to say the details in class, but I can email you after class, and supply any proof you need.”“It’s fine, please turn on your camera.”So I do, and my cousin is asleep, and I give the entire presentation, and I’m really proud of how it went, because I think I did really well, and I answer all questions, and my cousin doesn’t wake up! Like this is the best case scenario.Well, last night, I got my grade for the powerpoint, along with an email from the professor that says she marked me down because she felt the baby was there as a pity prop, and I was attempting to gain sympathy, and if I hadn’t had the baby, I would’ve gotten higher.So was I the asshole for showing up with a baby? I didn’t think about the pity aspect.edit :- sorry for the sporadic replies. i am still a university student balancing my shit. few clarifications. Yes, I did send her the proof she would’ve required to see there was an emergency. Yes, I will be reporting - and updating. Yes, there are better ways I could’ve done this, but a stressed and sleep deprived student isn’t normally the best source of judgement. The class was a philosophy one."
262,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my stepdaughter she’s absolutely under no circumstances allowed to switch out my cats food for vegan food even though she’s losing weight because the sight of normal cat food makes her sick?,25068,ghwz34,3784,"Sorry for the appalling title. My stepdaughter is living with my husband and I for the next year. Shes an educated young professional who’s saving up to buy her own home. Since she’s moved in with us (past 3 months) she’s become increasingly snappy and unhappy with how her dad and I run our lives. We aren’t environmentally conscious enough because we don’t compost our waste, we are negligent because we leave lights on when we leave our home for security reasons, we should switch to electric cars, we are contributing to the inhumane treatment of cows by consuming dairy, the list is endless. My cat Mango is getting to be an old ass man and he has lived a full life of eating whatever the fuck he likes (obviously within what’s safe for a cat) and hes happy that way. My stepdaughter is now insisting she will purchase vegan cat food because seeing Mango eat meat makes her sick. We feed him in the kitchen and she will literally throw up / retch/ leave the kitchen if she sees him eat meat. She HAS lost a lot of weight since claiming that seeing Mango eat meat makes her sick, and we leave out dry biscuits for him to snack on which also makes her sick. It’s not like we leave mess out but even if she smells his food in the am (which is gross, yeah, but the doors are open and that’s just life if you have a pet) she will heave and walk away. Her dad and I both told her if she’s unhappy with it she needs to find someplace else to live and although we are genuinely sorry she’s lost her appetite and has lost weight we aren’t going to change Mangos lifestyle- she has yelled, cursed at us, cried, begged, etc, but no, we are NOT happy with Mango eating a vegan diet. We don’t feed him cheap crap either, we feed him food quality cat food that isn’t processed or full of sugar or grain. It’s pretty much gourmet Gordon Ramsey worthy cat food. My MIL has waded in after my stepdaughter told her we were being unfair by refusing to let Mango go on her preferred diet for him, and is accusing us of being cruel and shortsighted. She says we are letting her get sick, and that Mango won’t hurt from a change in diet but stepdaughter is hurting."
263,Not the A-hole,AITA for putting bacon on my lunch to keep my Muslim friend from stealing it,24997,fg57ge,2365,"I’m not a super healthy person. At school for lunch, I usually get cheese fries. I know, very unhealthy. But one of my friends sure likes to steal my fries, as well as food from our other friends at the table. He’ll grab a bit from our trays and eat it when we’re not looking sometimes. It’s not usually a lot it’s more so just a nuisance. So I had an idea. My friend who likes to snatch our food sometimes is Muslim, and he keeps halal. Our school cafeteria gives us the option to get bacon on our fries too (I love America). I wouldn’t get bacon on my fries otherwise, but I would rather do that than set a precedent of my friend stealing my food. When I first sat down at our table, he said “What the fuck man? Why’d you do that?” My friends sided with him. They said I went too far by not “respecting” his dietary restrictions. Too which I replied, “his dietary restrictions shouldn’t matter if he doesn’t eat my food”. I think I was totally in the right to do that, but my friends just thought it was petty because I didn’t get bacon before and I only started getting it to give him the finger. Thoughts?"
264,Not the A-hole,"AITA For building a Fence and blocking my neighbours from the road, forcing them to take a massive detour?",24988,ics68m,1277,"So I am the owner of a large house with a huge property surounding it. When I bought my property 5 years ago I basically lived at least 5 minutes away from the nearest house, however the villages and towns have been expanding and as a result started developing houses next to my property.I was fine with it, nothing I could do about it to begin with, but my property is big enough not to really notice to begin with, or so I assumed.It's good to mention I basically pulled out a bunch of trees when I moved here and made a dirt road with gravel of sorts to allow me easy access to the main road nearby instead of driving all the way around to access the main road.Well soon after people started moving in to the houses I noticed people basically used my little road to access the main road nearby and kids used my field to play football, I was pretty much okay with it because it wasn't bothering me or inconveniencing me.Untill a few months later that was, basically whenever people had a party or a gathering I noticed my road and the field which they drove over was full of cars and a few weeks later some people started straight up using it as a parking area. I had multiple talks with multiple people and the results ranged from apologetic people moving their cars to aggressive people who told me to go F myself.I finally had enough and started getting cars towed which led to people yelling at my girlfriend in particular, as such I build a large stone fence around my entire property.Well multiple neighbors including the aggressive ones were all apologetic and asked me to remove the fence and how sorry they were for using it as they basically had to add 15 to 20 minutes to their travel time to work without my shortcut, I told them to go F themselves and to get the F of my property and if I saw them there again I'd be letting my dogs loose.However this is also impacting the nice neighbors so I am conflicted."
265,Not the A-hole,AITA for threatening to financially cut off my son over a baby name?,24987,ht049f,2722,"I had my son fairly young and I recently had a change of life baby. When I was four months pregnant my son, who was in college at the time told me that he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. I wasn't very happy but I've been supportive and I've given them a lot of financial assistance.I had my daughter two months ago and named her Clara. My son's girlfriend went ballistic. She said they were going to name their daughter Clara and that I should have consulted with them (umm I got pregnant first, but whatever) I told her she needs to grow up and that she doesn't own the name. My son asked me if I would consider changing Clara's name. I said no and he stormed out of the house.Well they told me the other day they are going to name their daughter Paxtyn. I guess I made a face and she started yelling at me that it is my fault, because I stole the only name she likes. I even asked her if she likes the name Paxtyn and she said she is going to like it when I have to tell my friends I have a granddaughter named Paxtyn. So she pretty much said she hates me more than she loves her daughter.My son said I have two months to fix this (change Clara's name) and I told them that they are both idiots, and I feel bad for their future child. I also said if they name their daughter Paxtyn just to be spiteful I will not give them any further assistance. My son called me up and said I was being controlling, but when I asked him if he actually likes the name he hung upEdit: They never mentioned the name Clara to meSecond Edit: Alright, I took some of your advice and texted her that I've been thinking about it and I kind of like the name Paxtyn and she wrote back ""fuck you, you evil bitch"" so I think that's the end of their money."
266,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling my mother that my step dad will not be walking me down the aisle because I hate him, and in turn ripping my family apart?",24959,ekwwcq,2496," I (23) am getting married to my boyfriend of 6 years in June. We're having quite a large wedding (fiance has a big family, and we have a lot of friends), but my family is very small. My only family is my mom (never met my dad), and I have an aunt and uncle who are childfree. Since I was little, having no father I always wanted my uncle to walk me down the aisle.My mom married my step dad when I was 12, and I've never liked him. He's a bully. He says horrible things to people, says racist, sexist, transphobic things for attention, and heavily contributed to my mental illness and eating disorder as a teenager. My mom knows that we don't get along, and she knows I didn't like him, but I gave up on confiding in her about how much I disliked him when I was around 15, because she would always insist that despite having a nasty mouth, he was a really good guy and he would never hurt us. So, it's been around 8 years since I've told my mom I hate him. I moved out when I was 19 with my boyfriend. I visit my mom maybe 3-4 times a week, I would try to time this around my step dad working so I wouldn't see him. As a result of seeing him less, I was more able to ignore his horribleness and we stopped arguing. I mostly stopped talking to him. He still refers to me as his daughter and my mother insists he loves me. It is not mutual, but everyone has assumed that I love him too and our relationship is just based on 'banter' rather than tormenting.So, when I got engaged, I asked my uncle almost straight away if he would walk me down the aisle. He was over the moon, but my aunt was like 'oh, you aren't picking step dad?' and I said no, I've always wanted uncle to do it. A few hours later, my mom called me crying asking why I wouldn't want step dad to do it, saying it's broken his heart. I told her that I've always dreamed of having uncle do it. She pressed on about how heartbroken he is, saying he always thought we had a good, funny relationship. This is where I feel like an ass. I said, 'there was nothing funny about him ruining my self esteem and teenage years. I hate him and if it were up to me, he wouldn't even be at the wedding'. My mom said that she's horrified that I still feel this way, once again spouting that he's a good guy and he loves me. I repeated that I hate the guy, and she said she'll tell him to back off.He's now angry at me and has asked my uncle not to walk me. My uncle is now not speaking to him, and I feel like I've torn what little family I have apart. AITA?"
267,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking girlfriend out after she deleted dead wife’s pictures from my phone?,24954,hy04og,3100,"My (25m) wife died 19 months ago. It was real hard on my the first few months but finally started putting myself back out there. I met girlfriend (23F) 7 months ago. It was going pretty well and she moved into my apartment around 4ish months ago. In hindsight we probably rushed this.My girlfriend is very overprotective and clingy and scared of me cheating as she’s been hurt in the past. I let her have my phone password so she could ease her mind. She saw a photo of me and wife and asked who she was and I explained. She seemed to take it well but was a little bit awkward about it.Fast forward 3 days and I go to take a shower and leave my phone on charge in the bedroom. I come out to see my phone unlocked. Weird but I let it slide. Later in that day I go through my photos to upload a new profile picture to Facebook. All the photos of my wife and me and her together are gone without a trace. I check my Snapchat my eyes only because I had a few in there along with intimate photos of us together. I knew it was my girlfriend.I confronted her about it and she started yelling. She said I need to get over it and get rid of all the reminders of my wife because she was here now. She also called me really creepy for “having nude pictures of a dead girl”. (Granted i probably should have deleted those a long time ago but I didn’t want to because they were special to me, might be AH on my part there). I was livid. I told her to get out. She stared at me in disbelief as I told her again. She packed some stuff and left. I went to my room and cried. I woke up to many missed calls and angry texts from her and her friends for calling me the AH. This might not have been a big deal but she permanently got rid of 95% of the pictures of my wife. I still have some printed like the wedding and some vacations, but I’m still missing a big chunk of them. I feel like she deleted a part of me as well. I’ve had to block multiple numbers (including my sisters, wtf). I do miss her though and want to talk but I’m confused. Reddit, am I in the wrong?Edit: SpellingEdit 2: Thank you all so much for your kind words and support. I’m taking your advice and kicking her out of my life for good. I’m also going to my local tech store later as they said there might be a way to recover my photos. I love you all !"
268,Not the A-hole,"AITA for supporting my wife after my daughter publicly exposed her diary which had ""cruel"" comments?",24953,hqgdyb,2620,"I have been remarried for a year now to my wife. I have a 15 year old daughter and a 11 year old son from my first marriage. I also have a 15 year old stepdaughter.My wife has always gotten along with my children very well and has gone above and beyond to integrate our families.And although at first my daughter was very standoffish to my wife, my wife was eventually able to bond with her. Only then did we get married.A few weeks ago, my daughter found my wife's diary that she had been writing to when we went to marital counseling before we got married. Both our first marriages were terrible so we were determined to do it right. I also was given a diary.My daughter then proceeded to read everything and even take photographs of certain pages. She then posted the photographs on Facebook and called my wife a bunch of cruel names.My wife had written a few things about how she wished I didn't have kids before we met so we could have had less issues dealing with my ex.She also said how she hated that my daughter had picked up so many bad traits from my ex.And the last thing related to my kids was that she said my ex was a terrible mother for weaponizing her kids.I admit I was taken aback and upset that my wife had written these things because I knew my kids would be hurt.But this was also a personal diary as part of a therapy exercise and the diary had been hidden in our closet.My daughter even posted some very sensitive information about my wife dealing with her father who was an alcoholic.My wife is inconsolable. A lot of my family and friends have turned on my wife because they think what she wrote was terrible.I disagree. She wrote things that she was concerned would affect our marriage and the counseling actually helped us deal with having stepchildren. And it's not like I shared the same opinion about my ex.I'm just so defeated. My daughter will no longer see me if my wife is around and won't step foot in our house. My son is following her lead. My wife has already apologized several times.My ex has said she will be starting the process to reduce my custody and sue for defamation. I know she won't win the defamation case but I feel like custody will indeed switch. I'm very stressed out.My daughter refused to take down the diary pages and insists she's in the right.I have taken my wife's side in all this. Am I the asshole? My entire family has been blown up."
269,Not the A-hole,"AITA for giving my child a ""culturally inappropriate"" name?",24955,el460c,4752,"I am black, and my wife is also black. I spent my most of my childhood in the foster system, but for a good part of it I was taken care of by an elderly Russian gentleman (we'll call him Dimitri Petrovitch). While he never formally adopted me, he played a major role in my upbringing, and I am very grateful for all that he has done for me. Unfortunately, he passed away many years ago, and he never had any children. Fast forward to today, my wife and I recently had a son, and to honor the memory of my mentor, I decided (with my wife's approval) to name my kid Dimitri Petrovitch Williams. Williams being my last name, and Petrovitch being my son's middle name. However, it seems like it's only my wife and I who likes this name, as her extended family has been quite upset over it, saying things like ""What kinda name is Dimitri?"", or ""You ain't white, you ain't Russian, why did you give your son such as a white name."" It's true that there's no part of me that's Russian (I an barely speak Russian), but I feel like he's been such a big part of my upbringing that I had to honor him somehow. I confided in my friends too, and they said something along the lines of ""You a black man and you gotta be proud of your own culture. You gave your son an identity that he's not even a part of, he's gonna have a hard time in school with that name.""So my wife's family aren't happy with our decision, and it seems like my friends don't really have my back either. I'm keeping the name that's for sure, but should I have reconsidered? Maybe I could've honored my mentor in another way?"
270,Not the A-hole,"AITA for ""hacking"" my moms instagram to see if she violated NDA?",24921,jkqq4c,2134,"I'm a nanny for a high profile family. I signed a very extensive and strict NDA. Anyone directly involved in my life, mom, dad, sis, and husband, also signed an NDA. The nanny family recommended this, to talk about the job without getting into any legal trouble or putting them at risk.Recently ran into one of my parents' neighbors, Amber, at the park. Amber asked how the new job was going, then proceeded to ask specifics about how it must be working for a family where the parents are (insert their jobs here). A direct violation of the NDA and something I could be fired and sued for.My dad isn't the sharing type, like at all, so I figured it was probably my mom. I asked her about it in a casual “Hey how’s Amber,” way. I said I ran into Amber at the park and that it was odd because she knew details about my job without me telling her. My mom simply shrugged and said, ""That's funny. Maybe she googled? Or saw something on social media?""My dad and sister absolutely hate Amber. They essentially said hell would have to freeze over before they spoke to her willingly. My dad ended our convo where I asked him about it by saying, ""The only thing I know about her is that her son just made partner at a law firm in New York and is making bank and that's only because mom saw it on instagram and told me about it.""Right then, I knew my mom lied to me and it was her. She and Amber love to ""one up"" each other with their children's success, and I also just landed a great new job. I asked my mom about it AGAIN and she told me that I was being dramatic, making stuff up, and that she would never do that to me.My mom doesn't text people, only DM's on instagram. I know her password so logged in to check her messages. There was an extremely long DM to Amber where she shared their professions, children's names, ages, private school, general locations of their homes, how they pay ""really well"", etc. Everything that we are legally NOT allowed to say, she said.I called her immediately and said that I logged into her DM's and saw the message she sent Amber that was a violation. She started screaming at me about how she is supposed to be able to trust her daughter, she can't believe I hacked into her instagram, that mothers should be allowed to brag about their children, and then she hung up.It has been a week without contact between the two of us. We used to speak every single day. I am starting to believe that maybe I'm the asshole here for violating her trust like that. My husband says if anyone violated trust here it is her and that I gave her ample opportunity to tell the truth before I intervened and sought out the truth myself. He constantly reminds me that they could sue us into the ground, and fire me, for endangering my nanny family's well being. Because truthfully, Amber could easily be a psycho fan or sell the information to someone who is. So, AITA?"
271,Not the A-hole,AITA for cutting off my family over my mom's will?,24903,gersvf,1635,"I always suspected my mom preferred my sister over me.  Growing up, she spoiled my sister with whatever she wanted and took her word over mine whenever we argued.  I was always in second place compared to her.  For example, when we turned sixteen, I was given my aunt's old clunker that ended up dying within six months.  When my sister turned sixteen, she got the brand new red Volkswagon of her dreams.  Mom said that I couldn't continue my piano lessons because they were getting so expensive while still supporting my sister's dance lessons, competions, etc.  Things got really bad about a decade ago.  When we were in high school, I feel in love with this guy, Joey, and started dating him for a while.  Only to for him to dump me because he preferred my sister.  Yes, my sister seduced him.  This really broke me because he was my first love.  Well, my sister and Joey ended up getting married after their college graduation.  And that is when things went from bad to worse.  Our mother had her will made and she was leaving everything to my sister.For background information, our childhood home was a two story building, where my mother's flower shop was on the ground floor and the apartment we grew up in was the second floor.  While I didn't get along with my mom or sister, I loved that flower shop and had been working there for most of my life.  I dreamed of owning that shop one day.But instead, my mother was going to leave the building, the shop and the apartment, to my sister.  While I could still work in the shop, my sister would be the owner and I would have to do what she says.  There was no use in trying to convince her to change her mind.  In her mind, my sister was the married one with a baby on the way.  She needed the business and house to raise her family.  Meanwhile, I was single and had nothing.So, I cut them off.  If my mother didn't see me as a family member, then I wanted nothing to do with them anymore.  It was clear who she favored more.  So I moved out of my childhood home and was on my own.  Less than a year later, I joined the Peace Corps and have been living abroad since.Now, to the present.  After not hearing from them for years, my sister found me on social media and reached out to me.  She wanted to talk to me, rekindle whatever relationship we had.  I told her no, that I never wanted to talk to her or have anything to do with her or our mother again.  She then starts to write this angry message about how I could do this to her and why would I turn my back on her.But as far as I am concerned,  she is not my family.  She hasn't been family in a decade.  My partner and our baby is family.  I have a new, happier, more fulfilling life in South Africa than I ever did back in the States.  I don't want to ever see my old family again because of how they treated me.  I don't want them to meet my daughter.  If I let them back into my life, I am afraid they will ruin the new life I made for myself.  AITA and being too harsh?Edit- Holy shit!  I am flabbergasted.  But for those who are guilding this post or are planning to, please donate your money to the Covid-19 first responders instead."
272,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to lie to my mother's husband about how I met my husband?,24867,hl4btk,2093,"My mother and I have never gotten along. She's very serious, overachiever, type A and I've always clashed with people like that. She is also pretty self righteous about things like pride, and work ethic, and she just isn't my type of person. I feel bad because I'm her only child and I really wish she had a daughter she could actually enjoy.My mom wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer, because that's what her friends kids were doing, but I rebelled pretty hard against school. I left home the day I turned 18 and got by through modeling, working at clubs with a fake ID, and dating rich men. She always said I would understand her disappointment when I had daughters, but I have two and I cant imagine being ashamed of something so petty.I met my husband when I was working as a yacht girl. That kind of just means I was paid by rich men to party on their boats and keep the guests entertained. I did date some of those men and they were very generous. My mom views that as prostitution. I don't know if I agree but I 100% think prostitution should be legalized so I don't really care. I met my husband. he scandalized his entire family by marrying one of *those* girls and we've been very happy for eighteen years. I do have an easy life and I'm not going to lie and say it has nothing to do with looks, but they were my looks to do whatever i want with.My mom doesn't like my husband. She thinks we both partied too much and she was hoping I'd grow up and do something ""respectable"" one day. She hates that he enables me to have the life she didn't want me to have. Well i met her new husband the other day. He works in finance, nice enough guy, but very straitlaced. He asked how i met my husband and I told him, the true story.My mother was furious and I did know she would want me to lie or leave some details out,but it's my story to tell and I'm not ashamed of my life. My husband thinks I should have lied and said it was full on prostitution, but he's kind of an ass. My mom actually cried after dinner so AITA?"
273,Not the A-hole,AITA for demanding my mom apologize after she blew up at my girlfriend who she thought was being racist?,24863,lyceex,2125,"I’m black and my girlfriend is Filipino. My parents aren’t the biggest fans just because we come from different socioeconomic backgrounds and they don’t think I should be with a “rich girl”My parents came over for dinner last night and my girlfriend was going to cook. Neither of us cook much and we eat way too much takeout, so she decided to make fried chicken because it is something she made with her mom growing up. Her mom came here from the Philippines and I guess it is pretty popular over there.When my mom saw the fried chicken she thought that my girlfriend was either making fun of her or just going off a racial stereotype. She immediately started cussing at her and demanding an apology. I explained to my mom that fried chicken is popular in the Philippines and I googled it to show her that there are a lot of Filipino recipes.She calmed down but did not apologize. I asked if she was going to apologize and she said it was just a misunderstanding. I said she should still apologize and she got offended, so I asked her to leave. I’m not talking to her until she apologizes but I don’t know if that is too harsh."
274,Not the A-hole,AITA for taking my ex-gf off my insurance policy to force her to give me full custody of my daughter?,24863,ilrb5f,2559,"Me and my ex gf, Hayley, have one daughter 15F, Elle. I genuinely don't know if I was right to do what I did. Around 4 years ago, Hayley had a very bad accident. That ended with her being wheelchair bound. This caused her to develop a lot of resentment towards me. She would get angry if I worked out or played any sports. So, I stopped doing anything physical mostly. We tried counseling for a year and things didn't improve. In the end, we broke up. Ever since Elle was born, I took out a private insurance for me, Elle and Hayley. This helped out a lot when she had her accident. Post break up, I still kept her in my insurance because she couldn't find any work and I knew if I dropped her from the insurance, she wouldn't be able to afford any treatments. It's been 2 years since then. We have 50/50 custody, so I don't pay any child support. In the beginning, I kept a very keen eye to make sure that she didn't resent Elle like she resented me. She didn't, so I relaxed. She is still on that insurance because she is not able to find any job except wellfare. I wanted both Hayley and Elle to be well, so I kept the insurance. Half a year ago when Elle came to stay, I noticed that  she was very depressed and had gotten very fat compared to before. Nothing overweight. But Elle does ballet and I have never seen her put on that much weight. Turns out Hayley forbade Elle from doing ballet because ""Hayley used to do ballet and Elle is just trying to rub her face in it"". The same for any physical activities like sports or exercising. With the quarantine, it must have been hell to live like that. Elle pretty much broke down and said that for the past few months, things have been escalating to the point that she is scared to walk inside her own house. She just stays in her room and comes out only to eat. Elle just begged me to go to court, so that I can get full custody. Elle is at an age where her opinion matter in court, but it's almost impossible to get 100 percent custody in my state unless I can prove incompetency, according to my lawyer. So, I dropped her from the insurance. Elle was supposed to stay with me for the next 6 months. Hayley couldn't get a job. She wiped out her savings as she had to pay for all her treatments. It was getting to the point that she couldn't even afford to get basic things for herself, let alone Elle. I also applied for sole custody. Given her financial situation and the pandemic and Elle's preference, the judge gave me full custody with supervised visitation for Hayley. Hayley didn't have a good representation at court due to her financial situation. Also, there is a pandemic going on. I left an already vulnerable person without any medical insurance. I know I did what i had to do to protect my child. But I did so by taking advantage of the medical expenses of a disabled woman. Elle is happy. Hayley obviously thinks I am a manipulative bastard. Everyone seems to have mixed opinions. AITA here? Also, dropping her from my insurance was completely legal. I am not from US."
275,Not the A-hole,AITA for not apologising to my roommate’s girlfriend because she saw me naked?,24836,k4unec,2044,"Basically this. My roommate (21m) and I (20m) aren’t close friends but we live together because it’s convenient for both of us. He has a new girlfriend and lately she’s been staying over a lot. Our apartment has two bathrooms, I’m saying this because it’s relevant later, one is in my room and the other one is in the hall. I use the one in my bedroom and he uses the other one. Yesterday, I was just out of the shower and walking around in my room naked, trying to find clothes and other stuff cause I’m messy, when his girlfriend barges into my room without even knocking. I do generally lock my room, but it’s never been a big deal because my roommate never comes in w/o knocking. Also, I did not know this girl was in the house. I’d have made sure to lock the door then. Obviously she went like wtf and ran out. Then she was very cross with me, and seemed to think that I owed her an apology because she saw me naked and it made her very uncomfortable. I was nope, you walked into my room w/o knocking, what you see or didn’t see after that is NOT my fault. At all. Her explanation was that the other bathroom was busy and she just wanted to use the one in my bedroom. She’s involved roommate into this and he too thinks that I should apologise because I shouldn’t have been walking around in my room naked without locking the door first. I’ve refused to apologise. AITA?"
276,Not the A-hole,AITA for not cleaning while I cook just to prove a point to my husband?,24833,kdp90m,2120,"I've always cleaned as I cook so that when it gets to the end of the meal, there's minimal mess. My husband is the opposite. When he cooks, it's like a bomb went off. I've encouraged him to clean as he cooks, and if we're doing a big meal/holiday meal together I often make sure to assign him that role.Like most people, one of us cooks, the other one cleans up. I am the better cook, so I cook like 80% of the time. He gets an easy cleanup.I'm busier than usual at work, so he's had to step up. Whenever he's done, the kitchen is a mess. I don't even get how it happens, there will be oil splatters untouched, stuff drying to dishes, peels and meat. I'm not about to let food sit out overnight so after I'm done eating I'll start the process and won't get to really relax much.Last week I asked if he could please try cleaning as he cooks. He told me ""the rule is one person cooks, the other person cleans."" I said ""I get that but you're leaving me with a huge mess every night.""He said ""I just don't have the time to clean up when I'm focused on cooking"" knowing full well I'll see him scrolling on his phone.I just got so fed up, so on Sunday I made a big pot of chili. I didn't clean up as I worked, when I was done, I served him, sat down, enjoyed a beer and dinner.When he finally went into the kitchen, he said ""What the fuck? Why is there such a mess?""I said that I was too busy paying attention to the chili to clean up. I started to get ready for bed. He was like, ""Uhh you're just going to leave this here?"" and I said yes. He said he would have to wake up extra early to clean up and that he had to be at work earlier than usual and was supposed to play a game with his friends later that night, so could I just clean up.I said no, I cooked, so he has to clean.Two days later he's still pissy with me because he ended up not being able game and told me that he didn't get enough sleep and was exhausted at work (not to be TOO snarky, but it's not like he's a surgeon) because I had to ""prove a point"" to him. I told him that nothing else seemed to get his attention, and I feel pretty justified. He told me I was being a smug asshole about it and it was childish.AITA? Or is he?**EDIT:** A couple of people asked how we can make so many dishes, it should take 15 minutes, etc. We don't have a dishwasher (there's no room for one), so everything has to be done by hand. Additionally, ""doing the dishes"" means cleaning up the counters and stovetop and sweeping the floor, taking out the trash if need be.When I make chili, it's a process starting w/ dried chilies that I toast, soak, seed, pulverize, etc. Then there's cooking the dried beans, then there's the onions and garlic and the peels, any other veggies, seeding tomato, cans of tomato, grinding the spices, etc. Then there's grating cheese for the top, etc. It definitely left a ton of dishes and other stuff behind.**EDIT 2:** Sorry guys I was reading comments as I was at work, I thought this would get like... 10 comments tops. So another thing that comes up is ""whoever cooks also cleans"" but since I cook most of the time, I just don't see that as being also fair to me. I'll end up spending almost every single day after work (I've been ending work at 6 or 7 some days lately) cooking AND cleaning. If I had him cook more I would definitely start to gain weight and then we'd have another issue altogether HAHAHAHA.**FINAL EDIT:** Thanks for all the feedback everyone. Oh and sorry to the people on ""AmITheAngel"" for the ""humblebraggy"" way I mentioned I make chili. Didn't mean to make you guys feel inferior because I toasted a few chilies. Lmao. ""Oh it's so fishy because she used dried beans"" Makes sense why people are asking for my recipe if the concept of toasting chilies and using dried beans is so novel. Lmao."
277,Not the A-hole,AITA - Wife got my Sister fired,24830,iv4o47,916,"I am currently fighting with my wife.She has a high position at a University.  She's has her PHD and has little respect for people who don't have an education.My sister is the same age as my wife, and she is also very successful.  Probably a bit more than my wife.  She doesn't have the education my wife does, but she has managed to be successful she does lie on her resume saying she has a BA degree.Recently, my sister was hired as a big wig for a company in NYC.  My wife was so angry when she heard about it.  She said that my sister was a liar and a fraud and that she should never have been given the job.Flash forward 2 weeks.  My sister calls me to tell me that she was let go because someone called the office to let them know that she did not have a BA degree.When I brought this up to my wife she admitted that she did in fact call my sister's job and let them know.I was stunned with this news.  My sister is responsible for taking care of our sick mother, and she is an incredible person.  She has worked over 2 decades in her field and she has been very successful.  I'm aware that she should not lie on her resume, but the company hired her after a background check, and at the end of the day, wtf cares?I had a huge fight with my wife about butting into my sisters business.  I pointed out that she herself has lied about her experience at times, and that she should have stayed out of it.  Now my sister is unemployed and I have no idea how she is going to pay for our mother's nursing home fees.  I have little money and my wife certainly isn't going to help.  This decision by my wife is causing unbelievable ripples in our family.  My sister helps pay for our nieces college, she's paid for our other sisters medical care after major surgery, and she's also helped me out by paying for my rehab 3 years ago when my insurance wouldn't cover the full 30 days.  She also donates 10% of her income to St. Jude's children's hospital.  She's a good person who wasn't able to afford college.My wife is livid with me for being angry with her.  She says that I should support her and understand that this is a major issue for her people lying about degrees, etc. and that it's my sister's fault for lying...and that maybe now she'll get a job that she's actually qualified for.I have not told my sister that my wife got her fired, and my wife has threatened to leave me if I tell her.AITA for being angry at my wife for doing this to my sister?  AITA for not telling my sister how this happened?"
278,Not the A-hole,AITA for banning everyone who critiques our parenting from meeting our son?,24795,e0muyw,3464,"My wife has minor anxiety and ocd. She has been on meds for a long time, but had to go off them when she got pregnant. None of the pregnancy safe meds worked for her. Pregnancy was really tough for her, she spent a lot of time reading about what foods and activities and such could harm a fetus, and she was basically paralyzed by fear that she was hurting our son whenever she did anything. It was really rough for her and she hated being pregnant. She had a mental breakdown and confessed to me that she didn’t want to breastfeed, she was feeling violated by the pregnancy and wanted her body back and to go back on her meds, but she was worried that our son would be terribly harmed if she didn’t. I talked her out of breastfeeding because the pros were far outweighed by the cons and she clearly didn’t want to do it.After the delivery, I was using the bathroom and my father was in the room with my wife. A lactation consultant came in and asked my wife if she was ready to breastfeed. My wife said she wasn’t going to breastfeed and the lactation consultant started pushing and reminding her of the benefits of breastfeeding (which to my wife, was reminding her of all the ways she was harming our son by not breastfeeding.) my father also started pressuring her. She said she just kept saying “I don’t want to,” but was very close to capitulating because she was so tired and anxious and she just wanted it to end. I came back into the room and kicked out the lactation consultant and my dad for not listening to her when she said no.Things got considerably better when we left the hospital. My wife was able to get back on her meds and was happy. This was the first part of the pregnancy/birth process that she actually got to enjoy. Her meds can take up to a month or two to have full effect, so the anxiety and ocd issues are still there, but much less.The conflict comes in because I told my dad he couldn’t be around my wife and son for the time being because he participated in pressuring her when she said no. I’ve also run into an issue when sending pictures of the baby to family. A number of people wrote back nitpicking how my wife my holding the baby, what she was feeding him, the crib we’re using and so on. I stopped sending photos, but my wife and I talked and she said she was still feeling fixated on everything she was doing wrong as a mom, and these critiques would make it worse.So I told everyone who critiqued our parenting that they can’t come meet the baby. They probably can in a month or so when my wife will be more secure mentally and as a mom, but until then, no one can come. Thus far, the only people who have met my son are my wife’s parents, her sister, and my mom.A lot of my family is saying that this is unfair because they have good intentions and are just trying to help. My mom told me I should give them a chance, but I think the risk is too big. Am I the asshole for banning them?"
279,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling someone I can read lips,24745,hidzc5,858,"This happened pre COVID btw.I've had hearing loss for most of my life , but it was diagnosed when I was about 7 years old. So I learned to read lips at the same time I was learning to speak. I'm very proficient in reading lips.Whenever I work with someone new, I make sure to let them know that I have hearing loss and to make sure that they are facing me and I'm aware they're talkin to me.I've never actually mentioned to any co-workers that I could read lips & but I'm pretty sure most of them at least suspect it strongly.A new co-worker started and I did my customary introduction and disclaimer about my hearing. I don't think she believed me because she got very offended when I ignored her. The problem being she was trying to get my attention from behind me and I genuinely did not hear her. Once someone got my attention I apologize to her and pointed out that I did have hearing loss and I wasn't aware that she was talking to me.A few days later she was venting to a mutual coworker. The only problem was she was facing me and I could read her lips perfectly. After a few minutes I approached her and let her know that if she was going to s*** talk someone she needed to make sure they couldn't understand her and that I was reading her lips the entire time.I told her I was upset that she wouldn't just come to me, and that I did tell her twice that I was partially deaf and couldn't hear her. She freaked out because apparently I was being rude by reading her lips when she was facing me"
280,Not the A-hole,"AITA for refusing to give ""back"" a gift that my boyfriend's daughter (13) had already refused to accept?",24743,eij1on,2225,"My boyfriend (37M) has two daughters. A 10 year old and a 13 year old. We've been dating for about 3 years now. I get along well with the younger daughter and she and I'm kind of like a big sister/auntie to her. The older daughter does not like me and makes it clear that she would rather her father not date me (or anyone else from what I gather). Boyfriend and his ex share custody and this year, since my boyfriend had them for Christmas, I got them both presents (got them both necklaces). 10 year old was very excited and happy with her gift. 13 year old got huffy and said she didn't want anything from me and refused to ""accept"" the gift. 10 year old also opened 13 year old's gift after she refused to accept it and I could tell that she did like what I'd got her. I decided to keep it for myself. Fast forward to today, 13 year old calls and she wants the necklace. She didn't apologise for her rude behaviour from before or anything (which I honestly don't care too much about). She asked me to give it to her since it's ""hers"" and ""you already bought it"". I told her that it wasn't hers since she refused to accept the gift and that I'm not going to give it ""back"" to her. She got upset and complained to my boyfriend who told her it was up to me whether or not I wanted to give her the gift anymore. Am I being too harsh on her? My sister thinks I'm just making my own life more difficult by not just giving it to her. Is it petty of me? AITA for refusing to give a gift that I did buy for her?**Edit: ok, I did not expect this post to get so much attention. Just to clarify a few things that are being asked, I'm 27. No, this is not the first time I've got them gifts. I didn't write down my thought process properly I've got them gifts before but they were ""experiences"" based gifts (for an example passes to amusement parks etc). This year because I was actually spending the day with them, I wanted to give a ""proper"" gift that they can actually keep and immediately ""have"" if that makes sense. And yes I kept it for myself, what else am I supposed to do with a rejected gift?** **Anyway..I realise that I did not handle this in the best way. I'll be seeing her today and explaining to her how I felt and why  didn't want to give it to her again and explain that perhaps we both could learn to appreciate the sentiment behind gifts better.I think I will decide what to do with the actual gift after having a proper conversation with her and seeing how that goes (especially since I already exchanged the necklace for a different one and no longer have the original one I got for her). Thanks for all the ideas as to how to approach her and this conversation. And yes I understand that she is still dealing with her parents breaking up and I feel for her, I really do.**"
281,Not the A-hole,"WIBTA if I quit my job, sell my share in company and retire to be a ski patroler? I would essentially leave my adult kids (18 and 22) to fend for themselves with no way to pay for college. Ex wife as well.",24741,blich3,4575,"So years and years of backstory here. Ex wife has BPD and life with her has been a continuous struggle. We are in the middle of a divorce because while she’s lied, stolen, abused, hit, etc... she never cheated. But she crossed that line and enough was enough. Divorce is bitter and ugly. For financial reasons we had set kids college savings up with my wife as custodian. I implored kids to go to the brokerage companies to remove wife as a custodian now they were adults. The both blew me off and “yeah yeahed” me for almost a year. Ex cleaned out every penny of the accounts, probably to buy her new house. Instead of my kids even asking thier mom why, let alone taking legal action they both held their hands out to me and expected me to make up for it. Then getting mad at me when I said I had far too much on my plate to add another battle with thier mom, they had to handle it. Since there was no way to pay for school this semester, both have essentially become shut ins at home. I’ve had it because niether shows an iota of interest in thier future. On a lark I called my college roommate who is head ski patrol at a small resort in NM. He said I’m hired. I talked to my partner and he’d gladly buy my half of the business. With the 50% id have to give my ex wife I could live modest and comfortably for the rest of my life. I could spend my summers hiking, my winters working and maybe just not spend 15 hours a day at a desk working for 3 people who just see me as a wallet.Kids would be cut off. I wouldn’t be able to afford ANY help. They have avenues and legal recourse with thier mom, whether they take it is up to them. But they’d have to grow up and fast.Would I be the asshole if I do this?"
282,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?,24738,aglogu,2161,"My ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.A few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.The one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.This was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.Was I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?"

My husband work night shifts-3 nights a week so he's usually sleeping at home during the day. He got himself a ps5 a month ago. He started spending time playing. He used to handle some of the house chorus now all he does is make excuses of how tired he is and how much he needs sleep. But he'd come home from his shift and starts playing. He drinks a lot of coffee to stay concentrated and awake. Also he stopped eating properly. Keeps forgetting to do things I ask him to do. Like help fix his daughter's toys/take turns in changing diapers etc.I started calling my mom to come help since he's been too busy to do simple things. He didn't like that I asked others for help and said I didn't have to. That he'll start helping again. I actually believed him and left for my 8 hour shift at the hospital and before I left I reminded him of everything he needed to do from feeding/changing diapers/cleaning our daughter's room etc. He said ""don't worry about it"" and then I left.I called him to check on the kids and he said everything was fine. I came home in the evening and I was shocked to see our 6 months old's bed was put in the living room. Her stuff on the couch. While he was playing. She didn't stop crying he said he didn't know what was wrong. Turned out he didn't change the diaper after I left. She was wearing the same diaper for 9 hours. He said he forgot but he was busy playing. I immediately took care of her. I knew her rash was going to get worse after that. My 6 year old's hair was a mess he didn't brush her hair. The kitchen was a mess. I was livid kept yelling at him for being neglectful and reckless and literally forgetting about his own kids over a game.He said that I was overreacting and that it was my fault for not reminding him on the phone. I told him it was my fault for leaving the kids with someone who doesn't even brush his teeth. He got offended and left the house minutes later.His mom called me telling me that my husband stayes up at night to make a living for his kids and that I was pressuring him by giving him more than he could handle. I tried to explain but she kept lashing out calling me controlling and said I might be frustrated from my job that's why ""I'm taking it out on him"".I hung up on her and had to take care of all of that mess.Sorry for any mistakes I'm just so exhausted."
284,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my boyfriend he isn’t entitled to my inheritance?,24709,f2wl3j,4246,"My grandpa passed away a few months ago and I inherited a little over $4 million from his estate. I had no idea he had that much money and was honestly not expecting to receive anything, as I assumed it would all go to my mom. After I got over the initial shock, I took the opportunity to finally quit my job (which I really hated), as I don’t have any outstanding debts and can easily live off of $40,000 a year. I’m pretty introverted and am more than happy to stay at home working on art/music/other interests and gaming.Ever since I inherited the money, my boyfriend has been pressuring me to cover all of the rent and utilities (about $1200 a month) for our apartment and start putting money away into a joint savings fund. I would be happy to do this if we were married, but we’re not. We’ve only been dating for a year and a half, and I would prefer to keep our finances separate. Despite not working anymore, I still pay my half of the rent every month and have started paying for a housekeeper to come in and clean a few times a week, so our apartment is nearly always spotless and looks great. I told my boyfriend he isn’t entitled to my money and he said I was being selfish for expecting him to still contribute to the rent when I could easily afford to pay for the whole thing. AITA?"

I asked her if it was mine and she said yes. I asked her if she had gone into my room while I wasn’t there and taken it and she sheepishly said yes. Just to be clear, we don’t have that kind of relationship, we’re friendly but not friends, so this felt like a huge violation. I told her to take it off and find something else to wear. She began crying and said she had nothing else to wear that would work for the event. I said too bad if she had asked me first it would have been a totally different story. I’m not cool with her just taking my things without permission. She ended up having a temper tantrum and not going. Her boyfriend texted me later on and said I was an asshole. AITA here?"
286,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving my husband in the grocery store because he started acting like a toddler?,24681,jx90uv,4085,"We all go through phases and pick up annoying habits, and sometimes we just need our loved ones to gently tell us if we've picked up a particularly egregious habit.Sometime in the last year, my husband has picked up a habit where he talks like a baby. At first it was funny, but passed into embarrassing, cringeworthy behavior quickly.Examples: doggo, pupper, woofer/subwoofer, pibble, hooty-boy, peepo, birb, meowmeow, sammy, sammiches, sammywhammy, chicky nuggies, chicky tendies, adding a toddleresque ""lisp"" to words, and the ones that really get gross are childish euphemisms for genitalia or sex.I cannot emphasize this enough: it is not endearing or sexy to have my husband talk about my ""boobies"" and his ""weiner"" and ""weenie"" and ""wee wee"", ""hoohas"" and ""bajingos"" (Nostalgia for Scrubs be damned). We have not had sex for six months because he cannot stop talking about my ""boobies"" and it makes me sick.Just before the pandemic hit, we were out at a restaurant with some friends, he actually ordered a ""chicky sammy"" like, said that exact phrase. Chicky. Sammy. Look, it's totally fine that he ordered the chicken sandwich. That's not the issue. Our friends noticed the baby talk, because he insisted on continuing the ""joke"" and even started talking with this god awful toddler... lilt? Accent?After that, I just couldn't stomach the idea of going out with him to adult places. I'd go out to the brewery with friends, but god forbid he join me and say ""Me wanty 'nother beer!"" or something.I don't know where it came from. I don't know why he's doing this. I finally hit my limit when we were grocery shopping and everything seemed normal and fine until he gasped like a kid, ran to the ice cream section and jumped up and down yelling ""ICE CWEAM ICE CWEAM! I WANT CHOCWIT!""I was *MORTIFIED*. People were staring at him and me. He kept going and kept saying ""CAN WE GET POPSICOOOS?"" and I just said ""Either talk to me like an adult or I'm leaving.""He started saying OOOOOO YOU MUST BE FUN AT PARTIES and LIGHTEN UP, WILL YOU? And shit like that. I just said fuck it, and left the store, leaving him to walk home (like a mile, it was fine) because I couldn't even look at him.Since then, things have been very tense, and he keeps telling me that he wants an apology for embarrassing him by leaving him in the store. I told him that people don't get to demand apologies, if someone wants to apologize, it's up to them, and I am absolutely not going to apologize for saving myself the embarrassment of a 35 year old man with a mortgage and retirement account asking for ""CHOCWIT ICE CWEAM.""He got his fucking Mom involved, no joke. She keeps telling me it's just a phase and that he's probably bored and I should be happy this is his midlife crisis, rather than him fucking 19 year olds at the local bar.I'm going crazy. AITA? Do I really just need to let my husband continuously embarrass me like this?**Edit:** Sorry, there was only so much space. I *have* talked to him. Multiple times. Especially about the sexual comments. I've made it extremely, abundantly clear that him using terms like ""boobies"" and ""wee wee"" are absolutely *repulsive* to me, among other things he says.**INFO:** Does he have a job? Yes, and he acts completely normal as far as I know. He worked from home for a while during lockdown, and I never heard him talk like this to anyone he worked with. **Does he do it with friends?** Sometimes, and it's generally meant to annoy them or gross them out, but he stops. He has friends where they think its ""cute"" to embarrass each other. **Is this a kink/fetish?:** If so, I'm absolutely done. (Edited because it was offensive)**Has he seen a doctor?**: No, but I've asked him if he needed to talk to someone because he was acting strange, and he accused me of being stuck up and judgmental. Given that he doesn't act like this with his coworkers, or his family, and only jokes around with his friends, I'm willing to bet that this is an indication that he's trying to force this fetish on me nonconsensually, or trying to get me to leave.**Is it a tumor?**: I don't know. Like I said above, I asked him if he needed to see someone. I can't force him (even if I want to, just find out if there's any way we can salvage this), but after this post closes I will try to get him to. Maybe his sister can encourage him, even though he acts completely normal around them.**Does he have childhood trauma?:** As far as I know, and I'm relatively close to his family and would likely know, the most traumatic thing he had happen was a minor car accident when he was around 13 years old. No injuries, no death, etc. He hasn't been in a car accident in the past two years or anything like that, and I haven't, and AFAIK no one else in his family has been, etc.**I want to send you a chat instead of my comment getting lost**: Please don't. I've had a number of people repost this to make fun of me because I didn't respond the way they wanted, etc. Just comment, I can at least to respond to those and help others get an idea of what's going on."
287,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling my fiancée about a secret room in our apartment?,24654,g3keje,3192,"I recognize the title sounds a little ridiculous. The situation is less so.I was very fortunate to be in a position to buy an apartment straight out of college. It's a weird unit on a high floor of a weird building, but I've gut-renovated it and made it really nice.One aspect of my home was created just to fulfill a childhood fantasy. A secret room! It's simple— a flush mount bookcase put in the doorway. It leads to what would otherwise be a windowless very large closet or a very small room.I made it into a cute secret lair / reading nook, but with no windows... it never got used. Ended up being more long-term storage.I never told anyone about it... because it was a secret room!I kind of figured at one point I'd tell my girlfriend, Emma, but I didn't want to tell her until I had a *reason* to. (I had finished it shortly before meeting her.)I figured maybe one day if we had a kid, I could remove the bookcase and bam, we'd have plenty of space to put in a changing table setup. Or a craft-nook for her.But I largely forgot about it, except when I needed to pull something out from back there... which is rare.**Fast forward to yesterday.**Emma, now my fiancée, has been living with me in my (now our!) apartment for eight months.During this time, I've kept the secret room... *a secret.*It's not like I was thinking about it all the time. I only consciously did something sneaky maybe three times since she's moved in, to get christmas lights, a spare coffee maker, and to put away a novelty item she probably thought I threw out.And the reason I was sneaky at those times was because again, I didn't want to waste the surprise on christmas lights!We've both been working from home lately, and we aren't really able to leave very often, due to circumstances... And she jokingly announced we needed a new room to shake things up from her normal commute. (Bedroom to Living Room.)So ***of course*** I excitedly pulled open our ""built-in"" bookshelf and showed her our room!***...And she flipped out.***She is furious at me. She sees me keeping this secret as a major betrayal of trust, given that this is her home. She's acting like I cheated on her. I tried to explain I was waiting for a special moment, but... she thinks that makes it worse.I have no idea if she's being unreasonable or if I am. AITA?"
288,Not the A-hole,AITA for filling a few faux Amazon packages with my dog's shit to teach the two theiving neighborhood kids who have been stealing my packages a lesson?,24609,cl8kbt,844,"This has been going on for a few months now, ever since school let out. There are two girls in the neighborhood who are about 8-10 and the oldest about 10-13... I have a video camera outside our apartment and have caught them red-handed. The first package they stole contained puppy pee pads and garbage bags, second package contained a pair of scrubs for work and last week they got a Bluetooth speaker.  Amazon replaced all my packages and I would rather not get the police involved and their parents are real asshats that don't supervise their kids, so I decided to fill a few packages with dog shit and leave them something special to steal to hopefully teach them a lesson. I also taped notes that said "" Dear Children, Stop stealing my shit!"" in the boxes along with the turds. Some of the turds are petrified, some were juicy and wet. AITA or am I a diabolical genius?"
289,Not the A-hole,AITA for disowning my brother for abandoning a girl after getting her pregnant?,24599,e639ni,2446,"Throw away because some of my friends know my reddit account and I want to keep this as private as possible. Sorry if the answer seems obvious, but I've had so much backlash Im starting to question myself.I am f25, my brother is m22. He lives with me since he moved out of our parents house, reasons are irrelevant. I came home to find him with his buddies in my home, getting wasted. I was pissed because he never asked if he could have people over (""Im an adult OP, I can do what I want""). Apparently he and his friends were throwing a ""bullet dodged"" party. He had been seeing this girl for a bit. She texted him letting him know that she was pregnant, but planning to abort the baby. She asked if he could financially help her pay for the operation. He. Blocked. Her. I was *horrified*. Apparently he and his brilliant friends decided that she had lied about taking birth control, because ""Its impossible for women to get pregnant if they're on the pill."" ….. right. I was livid. I was completely disgusted not only by their ignorance towards birth control and safe sex, but by the fact that he would block a girl and leave her completely on her own to handle a problem that he was at least 50% responsible for. I told him, in these exact words ""pack your shit and get the fuck out"" Obviously more than this has happened in the past, but this was my breaking point. I had tried so hard to bend over backwards for my baby brother. House him when he was homeless, help him get a job, give him rides... only for him to turn out like *that*? Nope. So anyways, he and his friends stood there like they didn't think I was serious. I said again, ""all of you get the fuck out. I don't want to see any of you here again.""Here's where I'm possibly the asshole. I told him in no uncertain terms that he needed to collect his things and leave. If he was old enough to make big-boy decisions, he was old enough to find a place on his own. He straight up said no. So I lost my temper. I grabbed as much of his stuff as I could, crammed it into a suitcase, and put/threw the suitcase outside. I shouted that if he didn't leave I would call the police. Fast forward tears and begging, he was finally out. That night I got *several* messages that I was heartless for making him homeless. They pregnancy wasn't his fault because: 1) it was an accident. 2) they weren't a serious couple so he has no reason to help her. 3) she should have been more careful. I called bull, and said I would never allow someone with that sick mindset live under my roof. I said that he is not my brother and I don't want anything to do with him. My parents, my aunts, and some cousins are with me, but that leaves about 3/4 of the family against me. They think that I should support him because he is my brother, I should have given him time (he's not on the lease btw, and he was *supposed* to pay rent but often didn't), and the punishment just didn't fit the crime.so reddit, am I the asshole?EDIT: so I didn’t think this would get as much traction. I’ve already seen some comments about it, and gotten some PMs, so Im gonna address this now. I only posted this to find out if I was TA for *how I handled it*. If I am TA, fine. So be it. But I don’t care what your views on abortion are, or how you don’t think he’s responsible for her pregnancy. So please do not comment if you’re just going to tell me about how abortion is sinful.EDIT 2: I cam currently trying to track the girl down. She is an old work colleague of his, and Im trying to find his old coworkers to figure out her contact info and see if I can help in any way."
290,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not letting my niece host her wedding at my ""castle""?",24568,jskty5,2059,"28 years ago my wife and I combined our savings (most of which came from inheritance after my father's passing) and bought our ""castle"" in southern Europe. It was actually a derelict farmhouse with some land but it has a small turret so our family has always referred to it as The Castle. My wife and I decided we'd rather have a small, basic house in our home country and focus our time and resources readying The Castle for us to retire in and for our children to enjoy.It took years but around the time our eldest was born it was finally finished. It's not massive 5 bedrooms and a small pool in the gardens but it is our paradise. We've always allowed our families and friends to use it whenever they please, and have spent every summer vacation staying there with our children.Our only stipulation when people stay there is that the master bedroom is off limits. It takes up most of the 3rd floor with the remaining bedrooms on the 2nd floor. A lot of my and my wife's belongings are in there, and it's also the room we have shared together for over twenty years. Recently my niece got engaged and held an engagement party on Zoom at the weekend. When asked what ideas they'd had so far she excitedly told me they'd actually been planning to ask us if they could hold the wedding at The Castle.I was a bit taken aback but didn't want to outright refuse. I joked it would have to be a rather small wedding since they'd struggle to fit more than 25 people in the gardens. She gushed that she'd already thought it through and they'd put up canopies in the field nearby (we don't own that land) and if all the guests stayed in hotels in the town she would arrange transport for ""us all to get to the villa"".My wife and I bit our tongues not wanting to make a fuss during their engament celebration. But later when my niece texted me to repeat what she'd said I asked her to clarify the sleeping arrangements and after some back and forth it came to light she plans to use the master bedroom as the bridal suite and for the wedding party to have the remaining rooms. My wife, children and I would have to stay elsewhere. I slept on my decision and spoke with my wife. On Sunday I responded and politely refused, saying it's too small and we aren't comfortable having anyone in our room. Both she and my sister blew up at me telling me I was ruining her wedding and she'd always dreamed of marrying at The Castle. My sister even said since I used my inheritance it's ""family property"" which is obviously ridiculous. ETA When we texted her on Sunday we offered a compromise: no master bedroom, and either get permission/insurances to use the fields, or reduce guest count to 25. We even offered to host a small rehearsal too but she rejected the offers. That is when we outright refused"
291,Not the A-hole,AITA for suing my ex and her boyfriend?,24554,kyiont,2467,"My ex and I divorced three years ago. She was cheating, but at this point I don’t care about the relationship anymore. The pending lawsuit has nothing to do with her or him, but rather their actions. My ex and I have a son 13m that we split time with 50/50. He’s a great kid that interests have changed a lot tbh as I imagine more kids/teenagers tend to do through the years. One thing my son was heavily into at some point was legos. He use to play with them all the time, and personally I think they’re a great toy for different reasons. I use to love playing them with him, and to this day I still collect boxes that I leave unopened as a collection.Well when my ex and I divorced she got with someone who loved legos more I guess? From what I know he loves making creations and building the sets in. I don’t care.. seems cool. He does one thing I think is very very weird.. He uses crazy glue so the sets can’t break or pieces can’t be lost. It seems so weird to me. The issue is, I was out of town for all of three days last week for medical reasons, and my son wanted to get his ps4 so he could play it at his moms. This isn’t out of the ordinary at all and he has a key, so he let me know he would be stopping over for it. I told him to have fun when I saw him on the entry camera. My wife’s husband was with him which was a no-no. I told him via speaker to not go in and to wait on the porch. He flinched but walked in any way. I sent my ex a text telling her to call him and tell him he’s one minute away from a cop call. He left my home with a bag in hand which I didn’t think much of because my son had his games too. Well my son texted me later that evening and said he didn’t know it at the time but he’s pretty sure SD took some of my sets. These are all old sets and two are worth big money. When I got home I confirmed the missing sets and called my ex. She had no idea but he admired he took them but it was so son could have the sets to complete his collection... my son doesn’t even like legos anymore and told his mom he wouldn’t steal from me. My wife asked how much it would cost to replace them and unfortunately it’s more than their savings. Actually, it would take their house down payment plus more. I told them if they didn’t pay in two weeks I was suing and pressing charges. The price in the sets makes it a felony. My ex and her husband are saving for a house which would give my son more space when he’s there, but those sets were going help pay for his education someday or a home of his own. I filed the police report and have talked to a lawyer and we’re moving forward with the suit.Everyone is calling me a joke because they are just toys, but I don’t get it. They are worth real money.. I’m not rich guys. I needed those to help with my sons future... but again taking this money does deny my son things at his moms house.AITA here??Edit* I’ve been asked to add these facts.The sets have been opened which more than half their worth, and one was glued together. The damage was done already. The stolen items are: Kings Castle  Milk truck Lego land train CarouselAnd the glued one was a Star Wars snow speeder.Some of these are one piece of a larger set. So if you lose one of five, you lose the value of one produce plus the value of the set as a whole.Second edit*Ex wife and boyfriend are the same as ex boyfriend.. I’m just a bad writer.Third/final edit for this post*I know I haven’t been here much but I have read many of your comments and taken them to heart. I know my spelling is poor guys, and I apologize for the format. Calling me names in my private message was not called for, and I am not a scalper. I enjoy buying these sets and do not intend to sell all of them, but I want my son to go to college and not worry about debt, so I want to sell the ones that I can to help. I never had the smarts for higher education but my son is not me, and I love him and want him to do better. Around 4:00 PM I called the local state police and met at their facility. I gave them all I had and gave my statement. My son is with me starting tonight so when I picked him up I sent him into GameStop and called his mom. I told her I had filed charges and I asked the cop to call me when everything was done so I could give him the opportunity to turn himself in. I wanted to be better than he treated me. I’ll save her reaction for a real update btw—- can someone please tell me how to update because I don’t really understand the steps in the main notes. I told my son when we got home what I did and why.My son said that I did the right thing because he didn’t want his step dad to think it was ok to do it again, and if he didn’t go to jail he’d rather be her away from him so it isn’t weird."
292,Not the A-hole,AITA for being topless at home?,24538,ewudks,2279,"I have a son (4 months old), I'm breastfeeding, he's forever spitting up on me, and we're trying to give as much skin to skin contact as possible. Because of this, I've pretty much stopped wearing clothes at home. I'll wear them when I go out, obviously, but in the privacy of mine and my boyfriend's flat I just go bare chested. My in laws were meant to come by around 6pm, and instead came by over an hour early and let themselves in with the spare key. I was sleeping on the sofa with my son on my chest, they got an eyeful. I woke up to them yelling at me to put a shirt on and asking why I didn't do that sooner if I knew they'd be over today. I maintain that they were a full hour early and why on earth would they just let themselves in when I didn't answer the door. My boyfriend wants me to apologise, I refuse. Who's the arsehole here?Edit: to everyone commenting about the sleeping situation as being a risk of suffocation/SIDS please know that I am fully aware of this and am taking all measures to avoid any injury/death of my child, this was a one off event after he fell asleep on top of me and we napped for less than an hour, probably closer to half an hour. I appreciate the concern but this is the only time it's happened and it won't be happening again.Update: I am aware of how the votes on here are shaping up but they are the only people I have close by rn. My boyfriend is mad at me for making things awkward, and my in laws are annoyed by what they saw, so I just called them and apologised. Going forward I will assume they will be early and not nap/be shirtless on days they are coming in case they arrive ahead of time."
293,Not the A-hole,"AITA for giving my son ~$15,000 when he turned 18 and moved out, but refuse to give the same amount to my daughter?",24522,c13jmx,3493,"My 19-year old daughter Vanessa called me this morning and told that her girlfriend proposed to her, and wants her to move to her apartment. Now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they’ve never don’t ever SEE each other besides a few quick weekend visits. Moreover, they’ve only dated for a little more than a year. I told her I was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. But I maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.The problem lies when Vanessa asked me for money. You see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, I decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn’t have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). That combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn’t have to work at all during the school year. Since I gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. I told Vanessa that I was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.She now says that she’s moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. Her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in IT). She said that now she’s not going to school, she’d rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.I told her I cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. If/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she’s married, I’ll be happy to contribute the money. But it’s not just a free handout.She’s got really mad that I rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. To her credit, her brother and I have a closer relationship (he’s always been the studious rule-follower while Vanessa was more the troublemaker), but I do love my children equally. I told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fiancé, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. That if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, I will fully support it financially.Well we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. My wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but I told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and I rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and WHEN she has to move back home. I don’t want her to think I support this decision.She told me she sorta saw my point, but she’s not going to help me unravel this mess with my Vanessa, she’s staying out of it. I, on the other hand, think she’s acting like a spoiled brat. AITA for sticking to my guns on this?"
294,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to train with a Nazi?,24502,jkzyqj,612,"So I practice BJJ for a couple of years, mostly attendings classes that require a Gi. This means that our bodies are pretty much covered (this is important).A new dude has joined our gym recently - I saw him in a class but did not roll with him. Last week I attended a no Gi class and the coach pairs me up with new guy. New guy wears a sleeveless rash guard, lots of tattoos on both arms and legs. I look at this tattoos and there is a big black swastika on his arm. As I take a closer look there is also the SS symbol - the one that looks like thunder bolts. Some other symbols here and there as well like the Celtic Cross.I tell my coach that I want to be paired up with someone else. Coach finds me a new partner but after the class asks me what is wrong. I tell him that the guy has lots of Nazi tattoos and I don't roll with Nazis. Now the coach is mad at me for bringing politics into the gym. I told my coach that he is bringing politics into the gym by allowing a guy to walk around with a swastika on his arm. Some guys from the class are behind me, some think I am making a big deal out of it AITA for refusing to roll with a Nazi?Edit for clarification: Not in the USA. Where I come from (Europe) there are still Nazi sympathisers - a minority but a vocal minority. Also you can easily roll with a long sleeved rash guard, the climate here allows it no need for no sleeves."
295,Not the A-hole,AITA for serving vegan food at my wedding?,24407,k0nuyg,2976,"My fiance and I are getting married in June next year. We're both vegans, and although we don't judge those who are not vegan, we wanted to serve vegan food at our wedding. We found a vegan caterer.When we sent out invitations, we added a note saying that the food will be vegan. We also asked that everyone who has any specific dietary requirements let us know. The note made it clear that anyone who needed a specific diet would be catered for. Soon after the invitations went out, my aunt phoned us in a huff. My uncle does not want vegan food he needs to eat meat, she said. I asked what his dietary requirements are, thinking that he has a specific medical condition and cannot eat a vegan meal. She said his reasons are ""cultural"" and he must eat meat. I said that's not really a good enough reason, we all come from the same culture and it's not like it's a sin to not eat meat with every single meal. I explained to her that I wouldn't really mind him eating meat but 1) it means I'll have to bring in a new caterer for one meal, which will be expensive and 2) I don't want to pay for meat if I don't have to. Again, I'm not judging non-vegans, but it doesn't sit right with me. Weeks went by. The only people who had dietary requirements were three cousins, who eat a low-carb diet. My vegan caterer came up with vegan, low-carb meals, and my cousins were happy with this plan. Upon hearing this, my aunt phoned me again, angrier this time, asking why my uncle can't be catered for because he ""doesn't like"" vegan food.I refused again. I told her that the food consists of things I KNOW he eats anyway: vegetables, coconut, nuts, etc. I went through a list of ingredients I knew would be in the food and she admitted he has no intolerances/allergies to any of that stuff. What's the big deal with him skipping meat one time? I told her that if he's so adamant about the meat he can buy himself McDonalds and eat it at the kiddy table.Now my aunt isn't talking to me, and is instead talking shit about me to all my family members. I told her that they are welcome to simply not attend the wedding if they're going to bitch about the food.I understand that veganism is not possible or sustainable for many people in the long-term but come on - it's ONE meal, that is FREE. AITA? I don't want to seem like a ""pushy vegan"" but I also don't want to pay for meat unless I have to. Again, it's one meal out of their whole life."
296,Not the A-hole,AITA for cutting off my hearing so I don’t have to listen to a family member.,24385,i7gwu8,983,"I (15F) am deaf in both ears after getting meningitis as a toddler. Luckily my parents really pushed intervention, so I can read lips, know sign language and have cochlear implants, so I’m basically like any other girl my age. I just can’t hear for shit.My aunt (40) has been staying with my family-that’s me, my mom, my dad and my 13 year old sister- during quarantine. She is REALLY not someone I like. She critiques every little thing my sister and I do, tells us we need to eat more (or less, depending on the day, even though we’re skinny), butts in to our personal conversation and just is snoopy in general. She tries to instigate fights between us- like asking my sister if she’s mad I have something she doesn’t. It’s also important to know she’s done nothing to learn about communicating with me. I’d say about 90% of the rest of my extended family knows sign language. We’ve told our parents about it a million times, and they’ve talked to her. I don’t think they’ve given her an ultimatum, so my sister and I devised a plan. For the past few days whenever my aunt starts talking, I just detach my hearing aids and my sister puts in her airpods and turns up the volume. We can understand each other fine. My aunt didn’t get it the first couple of times but I think today she understood we were ignoring her and got really upset. She told my dad, and from what I understand, he basically told her she needs to lay off if she’s bothering us that bad or she can leave. I was happy to hear that, tbhz I heard (lol) her crying later though, and that made me feel like *shit*. I never meant to make someone cry and now I kinda regret the whole thing. Are my sister and I assholes for going to such extreme measures? We just wanted her to leave us alone, or at least be nice to us.EDIT: Wow I went to sleep and look what I woke up too! Thanks for all the nice comments and stuff! Here’s a few things I wanted to point out.I have good hearing with the implants in. Without them in,  I will only hear some thing VERY loud right next to my ear (like if someone claps into it). Doctors typically rate it on a scale- I am severely deaf. Cochlear implants have two parts- external and internal. The external connects to the internal with a magnet. It comes off like you would take off a magnet on your fridge. I CAN switch it off, but I thought the message would get across better if I yanked it off my head. I wish I could answer everyone who’s PM’d me or left comments about the implants. I think unfortunately that’s something for your doctor- everyone is different. I agree aunt doesn’t need to learn sign language. However- because I was in early intervention and then speech therapy for most of my childhood, I have a more “normal” speaking voice and so she says I should talk. It’s a bit nasally sounding to me and I prefer to sign. Aunt likes to move out of my line of sight and that forces me to speak and makes me feel bad. Also, yes my little sister is amazing. Thanks for all the nice comments about her. She’s my best friend and I love her so much. We decided to be nice to aunt today and see what happens. Talk atcha later!"
297,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving a repairman a bad review for flirting with my wife?,24383,i26ptx,2829,"The air conditioner broke last week while I was out of town and my wife had to call an emergency technician in the middle of the night. A company we’d used before without issues sent a guy over. He fixed the air conditioner no problem, but once he’d left I woke up to a million missed texts and calls from my wife, who was hysterical. Apparently within minutes of showing up he made comments about her body and other suggestive statements. She made it clear she wasn’t interested without being outright rude because she didn’t want him to get mad and leave without fixing the air conditioner. The tech kept trying to put moves on her, then after he’d fixed the A/C, he didn’t leave right away, trying to feed her some lines about how she seemed to be home alone and he could “spend the night to make sure she was safe.” Eventually he realized he was driving down a dead end and left, but the whole thing just really freaked her out, having some guy in the house who didn’t leave when asked and everything. I was pissed to hear about all this, and she was shaken up by the incident, so we left a review on their Google and Yelp pages saying what had happened. The company is pretty small so the owner called me to apologize a couple days later and said the tech had had a few drinks that night, not expecting to be called out to an emergency job, and that “his sense of humor had clearly been misinterpreted” by my wife. He asked me to take my review down because it called the tech out by first name and apparently a review saying he was coming onto a female customer could cause some personal problems for the guy. The owner also reasoned that the business was an air conditioner repair business, not a bedside manner business, and that they did fix the air conditioner, so deserved a higher rating. I told them our review stands, and they basically said we were assholes for threatening the reputation of their business and the personal reputation of the tech over a single misunderstanding. On the one hand, they did fix the air conditioner, and that’s what we called them to do. On the other hand, I feel like this is relevant information for people considering hiring them, even if it was a one time thing. AITA?"
298,Not the A-hole,AITA for not giving my brother(and wife) the bigger room?,24383,jeujp5,2702,"My brother’s wife lost her job. Which has caused them to lose the house they were renting. My brother asked if he could stay with me. I talked to my bf and he said sure. So, I told my brother yes, *BUT* he can’t bring any of their furniture with them. We don’t have any room for any of it. Our spare room has a bed and dressers in it already. He’ll have to find a place to store their things. He wasn’t happy about it, but said okay and that was that.When they started moving their clothes and whatnot in, they started complaining about how small the room was. I ignored it, because they were used to a rather large house. And I was sympathetic, because I know how it feels to go from having everything to nothing. I apologized and told them that this was the best we had. Issue:My son was in his room, and started crying. I went in there to check on him, and my brother got MAD. I usually keep his door closed when he’s napping(I have a baby monitor) and I guess my brother saw how ‘large’ his room is. It’s not big, at all. By any means. It’s just bigger than the spare room. He asked “why the hell” we gave him the small room when we can just move our son into the spare room. I told him I’m not moving my son and all his things into a different room when the spare bedroom is perfectly fine for the two of them as long as they don’t try to move their entire house into one room. He got mad. She got mad. They threw a fit. Then my brother asked why we don’t move my son into our room. I told him that my son’s crib won’t fit in our room. And again, I’m not moving him just to to accommodate them. The last week or so has been very...tense. Small comments here. Cold shoulder there. Petty shoulder checks from his wife if we cross close together. I’ve kept my mouth shut, because I love my brother, and I don’t want to cause trouble. Plus, if they weren’t so pissy(I guess is the word) they wouldn’t be hard to live with. They’ve started to complain that my son’s crying at night is keeping them awake. Which, I get, but he’s a baby. He only wakes once a night to eat. And that’s not even all the time. This morning it all came to a head when my brother told me I should move into the spare room and let them have mine and my boyfriend’s room so that they don’t get woke up by the baby. When I told him no, he started yelling. Calling me selfish and entitled. Told me that I should let them have my room, because my son is “an annoying little shit that keeps them up every night, all night.”Where I may be the asshole:I saw red. Let me start this by saying I did NOT yell at my brother as he yelled at me. I said “If you can’t appreciate the room you were given, you can go elsewhere. My boyfriend and I have been more than accommodating to you. You constantly complain. You’re ungrateful and rude. Get over yourself or get out of my house.”ETA: I’m asking if I’m TA because my mother called and told me I’m an asshole for not giving the married couple the big bedroom with the connected bathroom. And apparently my other siblings agree?ETA2: They do not pay rent. My boyfriend and I own our home and don’t pay anything on it. They pay the difference on the electricity bill and buy some of their own groceries. I do the majority of the cooking and all the cleaning.ETA3: Boyfriend and I are going to talk about kicking them out tonight when he gets off work.ETA4: I will update y’all tomorrow 😂"
299,Not the A-hole,AITA for not paying for the extra meal I accidentally ordered at a wedding?,24361,d2cd5s,2562,"My sixteen year old son and I went to a wedding. When we got the invitation, we both chose to order chicken for the main course. There was an option to select a kid's meal version of each dish, but I never considered ordering one for my son because he is too old for kid's meals. I sent in the RSVP card with our meal selections and never heard anything about it.At the wedding, my son and I got our food, but the table was one chicken meal short. The waiter had a small plate of chicken fingers and fries, but everyone at the table told him it must be a mistake because we didn't have any kids sitting with us. The waiters were able to put together an extra chicken plate for the person who didn't get one, and it seemed all was well.I later got a call from the bride's parents, who told me that the chicken fingers had been for my son, and that I had caused the caterer to charge them for the extra adult chicken meal. I told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. They said I should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that I should have asked for clarification if I wasn't sure. But I wasn't unsure, I never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal. Ten and under I would think would have kid's meals and eleven to thirteen is questionable, but fourteen and up I would never think would have a kid's meal. The bride's parents told me it's normal for anyone under eighteen to get a kid's meal, but I've never heard of eighteen being the cutoff. I think it's rude to feed a sixteen year old a meal meant for a six year old. WIBTA if I refused to pay for the extra meal and told them it was their mistake for changing my son's order? I know wedding meals are expensive, but I think this was their mistake."
300,Not the A-hole,AITA I lied about having a college fund for my step sister to save my sister,24338,igywqa,1035,"I am 32F. I grew up with a narcissistic mom. I have never met my dad. The first hug I have received in my life was at 10 years old when Dan (my mom's BF) hugged me when I thanked him for a gift. My mom had my sister a year later. My sister was the perfect baby sister anyone could ask for. Mom and Dan split and at first mom had major custody of my sister. Mom did the same thing to my sister she did to me, doesn't even acknowledge us in the room if she was not in the mood, not feeding us dinner if we made a mistake, made everything our fault. When Dan found out, he applied for full custody for my sister but my mother fought and somehow wrangled 50% of custody.Things got real bad for me and the only silver lining was my sister. Despite being only 4 years old, she would sneak in snacks from her dad for me to eat. Anything Dan bought for her, he also bought me. He wasn't wealthy by any means but it was the small things and anytime he dropped my sister, he will take his time to talk to me. He was the only father I have ever known. Dan died of cancer when I was 16 and my sister 5. He lived only 3 months from the diagnosis but settled everything financially as able as he can for my sister. He split his assets 75% for my sister and 25% for me to be given to me when I reached 18. Knowing my mom very well, he made me the executor of my sister's fund too. To say my mom was furious was an understatement. She literally made the next 2 years of my life and my sister a living hell.When my mom started dating Brad, he already had a daughter 3 years younger than my sister. My mom had made it absolutely clear that my sister will be allowed to go to college only if she shares her trust fund with our stepsister. Brad is a piece of work and me and my sister never really bonded with our stepsister. She refused to sign anything related to my sister's education unless I give her my word that I will give my step sister equal half of the trust fund. This is where I think I was the asshole. I held the trust fund above my mom's head to treat my sister fairly. I repeatedly told them I will give my step sister half the fund until my sister was 18 and moved to college.  Once she moved out, we both cut any contact we had with our mom and blocked her. I made my sister give her the wrong college info, so our mom couldn't contact her.I have found out through few friends my mom didn't know I have that my step sister couldn't get into any college because she didn't want to apply any loans and she is very depressed. I know I misled them, but I honestly wanted my sister to be safe.AITA for causing my step sister's depression and robbing her of collegeEdit: Thank you everyone for your reassurance. I showed this post to my sister and the only thing she had to say was ""Duh"". We both have discussed and decided to not contact our step sister. We were never close to her and my friends back there can't safely get any message to her without dragging our mom into it which is the last thing we both want.All these awards, thank you all again and the kind stranger who gave me gold."
301,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my friend that she is only welcome at my house if she doesn't bring her husband,24334,ifavsp,1780,I know the title sounds bad please hear me outSo I have severe epilepsy and have a service dog Onyx. Now Onyx does have time to cuddle and relax and be at rest and just be a dog. But when he is working he is WORKING at keeping me alive. He's saved my life multiple timesNow my friend has been coming over a lot recently to visit. I love her but have an issue with her husband. He's one of those types who harbors the believe that have a dick makes him superior to women. He also doesn't believe in invisible disabilities and because of Onyx he's never seen me have a seizure.Last week they came over and her husband was being playful with Onyx which was fine as he was at rest. A little while later though the husband began asking if he could dogsit sometime bring Onyx to their place for a sleepover. I said no and explained AGAIN that Onyx is a service dog and I needed him to ya know...... Stay alive. Her husband got an attitude and told me Onyx wasn't a machine and I had no right to deprive him of fun. Then he pulled the I'm a man so I know more than you card by explaining that I was wrong and he was right and I could go one night without onyx and control my seizures. All this time my friend sat on the couch saying nothing. I asked him to leave and after some huffing and puffing about how rude I am and what happened to manners and Onyx would've had fun they both did.Now today my friend called asking if they could stop by. I explained that I would love to have her over but her husband was no longer welcome. She got upset and told me that he was just like that and it was hard to tell sometimes because he had never seen me have a full blown seizure. I got kinda mad and sarcastically asked her if I should purposely cause a seizure so her husband was comfortable. She just kept repeating that he meant no harm and wanted Onyx to have fun. I just told her again that she is welcome but he is not.AITA. I feel awful and feel like I'm creating an issue but that man is just toxic energy and I worry that his disbelief of my need for a service animal will cause him to do something completely crazy.Edit. I had to work with Onyx for two weeks at a training center before I could even bring him home so he knew exactly how to help me i.e read my body and triggers and so we worked together and we're completely in synch. He's extremely well trained and I feel like that might have something to do with this.
302,Not the A-hole,AITA fot kicking out my daughter after she tried to send my cat to the shelter?,24331,hg83en,2861,"Throw away for obvious reasons. TLDR at the end.the relevant backstory: I have two daughters, one is 21 and in college, the other is 26 and because of a lot of factors finds herself pregnant, divorcing her husband and needing to live in our house for the foreseeable future and I am happily married to their mother.  The other notable character is my cat Lieutenant (we call her Leut). I found Leut in a dumpster almost ten years ago when she was only a week old, got her to the vet and she has been my best buddy for the last decade. She is now my grumpy old little shadow whenever i'm home.so yesterday I came home from work and I hear my eldest daughter calling me from the kitchen. my wife and eldest then tell me that ""Leut is getting old dad, and with the baby coming we didn't think it was safe to keep an old grouchy cat around an infant. So we made the decision today to send Leut to a shelter so that she can find a family that is more in line with what she needs.""I told them both they were WAY out of line (not in so many words) and we would talk when we get back. I drive to the closest shelter, fine Leut, prove ownership, pay the $100 fee to get her back, and take her home.So here is the drama part: When I get home I call a family meeting and tell my eldest she doesn't get to make decisions about my pets without consulting me, Leut only wants to be left alone and even if it came to it i would rather exhaust all my options before putting Leut through life at a shelter. My eldest began arguing with me that Leut would be a liability around an infant and she is unpredictable (untrue, she is either asleep, sitting on her cat tree or eating). At that point i saw red and told her my cat is well trained, and dared her to come up with one instance of Leut even scratching someone, which she couldn't but kept insisting that old cats are inherently dangerous for kids. I then told herthat she had one month to get a new place to live as she clearly doesn't respect me or my things, and that if Leut so much as lost a whisker, I would hold her personally responsible.My wife and younger daughter are now begging me to change my mind as with my eldest's current financial condition i would probably be condemning her to homelessness, and that my daughter should come before a cat.AITA for kicking my daughter out after she tried to get rid of my cat?TLDR: eldest daughter decided to send my elderly cat to a shelter over fears she would harm her baby when the child is born. I kicked her out. AITA?Edit to add:As many people have brought up, no i am not being as hard on my wife as my daughter. My wife came up to me last night and basically begged for forgiveness, saying she wasn't thinking and just accepted the things my daughter was saying without checking  (very out of character for her). So I have told her i will need some space for the foreseeable future but that she and I are ok.Leut is already microcipped and wears a collar and tag. I have also contacted all the shelters around my area and sent them Leut's picture chip ID and my contact information and an explanation that i am worried someone may surrender my cat without my permission."
303,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my daughter the truth about why I wasn’t in her life?,24319,ln04z1,2172,"To start, my ex and I were 19 when she got pregnant. We had recently broke up and she found out a couple weeks later that she was pregnant. She said she planned to get an abortion but only wanted her sister there.So I was always under the belief that she had aborted. She only contacted me once saying it was done and we didn’t speak again. Fast forward 19 yrs later, I found out a month ago that was a lie. My ex passed away 3 years ago and my daughter Kara has been living with her uncle. He was the one to reach out to give me a heads up after she expressed an interest in wanting us to connect. He and I spoke at length because I was feeling some pretty strong emotions like rage for never being told about her. My ex had backed out of the abortion but didn’t want me involved because we were broken up so decided just not to tell me. But he told me that Kara doesn’t know about that. Apparently I wasn’t ready for fatherhood because we were both young so I bailed. I couldn’t believe it. Rob (her uncle) told me he knows his sister was wrong for that but promised Kara doesn’t have any negative feelings towards me and my ex never painted me as some villain, just a young guy who knew he couldn’t properly care for her. He asked me not to tell Kara this when we talk if she asks and because it could hurt the way she saw her mom. I never actually confirmed I would.Kara messaged me and we’ve been talking. I’ve met her twice and it’s been crazy emotional. Looking at this girl who looks just like me and hurting that we’re just barely getting to know each otherSo far our conversations have only been about what her life was like, how my life is, what her wants/future goals are, and getting to know each other.We met again Tuesday and she finally decided to ask the obvious questions about what made me not be involved. How did I feel, what went through my mind, did I ever think about her,etc.I had been thinking about what to do but in that moment I just didn’t have it in me to lie so I was honest. That I was told about the abortion, had no idea she even existed until now, but that I still really want to be in her life and have the chance to be her father if she wants that. Kara was a bit emotional, we talked some more, and said she still wants me involved.That night my messages were blowing up. Not just from rob but her grandparents as well. They’re all outraged for telling Kara about her mom because she yelled at all of them and is refusing to even take their calls. Yes, the lie was terrible but I just ruined the image she had of her late mother for my own benefit. Rob called me a selfish dick for not taking into consideration how this would affect Kara finding out about this.So right now I feel like shit. I get “honesty is the best policy” but in this case I don’t know if I was an asshole for doing it. I’m still learning this whole “dad” business so don’t know if I dropped the ball here."
304,Not the A-hole,AITA For not giving my wife her daughter's address so she could see the newborn?,24274,ku4ppq,1958,"Hear me out please. I'm a 46 year-old father who lost a daughter (Molly) years ago to Brain Cancer. Molly's death broke me. She was my only child I'm no longer who I was before this tragedy. I married my wife when my stepdaughter (Sarah) was 15. Sarah had issues with her mom. Her mom would kick her out over small arguments. She kicked her out for getting a haircut, for failing one class and other reasons. Every time she'd bring her back home and tell her to learn her lesson or she'd be kicked out. One time her mom kicked her out over a dairy at 17 and Sarah had enough and didn't return. She started working. I remained in contact. I just couldn't let her struggle I tried to help her financially but she refused. she's incredibly independent and a hard working person. She reminded me of Molly. I decided to help in other ways. I got her a better job opportunity by calling someone I knew at the time. This way she still had to work to earn money which is something she wanted. And also work a better job that appreciated her more than the previous job. She's an artist, she wanted to be a graphic designerI sold my old car to pay for her courses. She started paying me back bit by bit only because she's independent. She lived with her then boyfriend now husband and paid for other things.My wife didn't try to mend things. She disowned Sarah the day she got married but I stood firm and told her that I'm free to talk to Sarah and she should respect that.I attend gatherings with Sarah from time to time and she calls me dad infront of other people. In the past it was just my name.This sounds crazy but I believe this all happened just so I could meet Sarah and have a chance at being the best father that I could be.She's now 22 and just had a babygirl a few weeks ago. I visited several times and we talked. She told me that it was unfortunate that she lost her dad but was glad she has me in her life. I cried although I'm not good at expressing emotions and it got worse after Molly's death.My wife knew about the baby and demanded I give her the address so she could go see her granddaughter. I refused because Sarah asked me not to tell. And because she's already dealing with postpartum and will not be able to deal with her mom's behavior. My wife threw a fit and said that this is her daughter and grandbaby and I shouldn't try to stop her from seeing her. She called me selfish and cruel. The argument didn't stop. The family are agreeing with her and telling me to stay out of it. I argued with my wife about it again. And she said I had no right and that I needed to give her the address. She didn't even seem regretful or wanted to apologize. Everyone is blaming me telling I'm being cruel and demanding I give her the address."
305,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my family to stop celebrating?,24266,hugvzj,1426,"6 years ago I met the best person in the world. She was a sweet old lady that moved in next door, named Maggie. Maggie taught me how to knit, we watch Mamas family together, i helped her give her cat her medicine, I helped water her plants when she got to frail to do it herself. She knitted me a hat for every holiday., I helped her install WiFi. Maggie was a nurse in WWII.Maggie passed away 3 months ago at the age of 94. She went peacefully in her sleep, and it is the heartbreak of my life. About two weeks after she died, I noticed a man walking into Maggie’s house. Maggie didn’t have any family except for a nephew, who lived across the country. I went up to him and asked who he was, and he said he was going to clean out his aunts things.That was the end of that until yesterday. Maggie’s nephew had rung my doorbell, and had told me that Maggie left me most everything she had in her will. Maggie left me 1 million dollars in a account I can open when I turn 18, most of her personal effects, and her cat, blue. Who I rescued two days after she died and kept. She wrote me and her nephew letters. she said some stuff I would rather not share. It tore me up about Maggie even more. She was such a gentle soul and she deserved better. I started crying, and I told my parents. They started celebrating about  it immediately. I asked them to stop. And they did, until today they presented me with a cake, that said “hey, you get to go to college!”. To say that it made me upset is a understatement. I get that Maggie’s money is a life changing thing, but I would much rather have Maggie. I told them to stop celebrating then I went to my room to hold blue and cry. My brother knocked on my door and told me I was being a asshole because our parents are just happy for me. AITA?"
306,Not the A-hole,AITA for making a girl cry by calling her fat when she was roasting me for being skinny?,24245,ad9ycy,2554,"Context: So a couple of girls in my college friend group have a roommate called “Jan”. I am acquainted with her and we never really had any problems, we actually made quite a good beer pong duo. I’m a tall and lanky male at 6’1 and 155lbs. Jan is a white chick on the heavier-side.Recently, we had a watch party at Jan’s apartment for the Michigan Football Bowl Game where our friends were all having a good time getting pretty tipsy. My buddy and I were talking about whether our QB should declare for the draft or return. I said “I sure hope he comes back, Dylan (our backup QB) is still young and is still pretty scrawny.” Jan has a huge crush on Dylan and didn’t appreciate that I called him skinny. This caused her to go on a drunken tirade saying “what makes you think that you can call him skinny when you’re literally built of twigs?” “You would die playing football. Tbh I don’t think you could even lift a helmet!” At first, I took it on the chin, had a chuckle about it, and poked back a bit. I usually got my leg pulled about my physique but I never took it personally. Until she started making it personal.“Look at you, you’re like one of those starving African kids on those TV commercials”  (I’m brown but not African)“That’s why Dylan is a chick-magnet and [my ex] dumped you. You look malnourished”She kept going and now I was beginning to boil. I wasn’t even responding at this point, just biting my tongue. But then I snapped.Her: “Go lift some weights. It’s okay no one will judge you if you can only curl 5 pounds.”Me: “If you could tell me what your current diet is, I’m sure I’ll put on weight in no time.”*silence*Her: “What are you trying to say?”Me: “I’m saying that if I’m a malnourished African then you could be on The Biggest Loser. And I’m pretty certain you wouldn’t win.”Her: “No wonder [ex] didn’t want you. Go fuck yourself.”Me: “And no guy wants you. The last dick you got was Moby Dick. Fucking whale.”At this point she was in tears, make-up running and everything. Her chick friends helped her into a bedroom to comfort her while looking back at me with a death glare.Since this was at Jan’s place, I figured I should leave (Michigan was getting slaughtered at this point anyways). I finished my beer and left. I got a FaceTime from one of my friends who is Jan’s roommate. She urged me to apologize because she was just playing around and I went too far. I didn’t feel that way and I don’t want to apologize.Am I the Asshole?EDIT: grammarINFO: we were both drunk but I’m pretty certain she had drank more than me EDIT: woah! thanks for platinum and silver you beautiful bastards! 🤯INFO: I was drunk so the real argument obviously had a few stumbles and slurred words.

307,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to give my parents money?,24242,hfkctd,2696,"I’m a 19 year old F with six older siblings. My parents spent most of my childhood spending money they didn’t have on my siblings, so by the time I hit my teenage years, I realized I was probably going to have to fend for myself financially when I turn 18. I started babysitting and doing odd jobs around my neighborhood when I was 14, and eventually got part-time jobs during the school year. By the time I was 16, I was working three jobs in the summer and two in addition to school. When my parents told me they couldn’t pay for college, I’d already earned enough (along with scholarships) to be able to put myself through college and have plenty left over. I’ve continued to work during the school year, and have been able to make money during quarantine by tutoring online. The issue began a few months ago, when my eldest sister (29F) got married. My parents spent 30 grand on her wedding, taking out a second mortgage to do so. To make matters worse, my dad was furloughed 6 days after the wedding. They’d effectively dug themselves into a hole they couldn’t get out of. Two weeks ago, my mom texted me for the first time since the wedding. She didn’t say hi, ask how I was, or make any small talk. She just said “Your dad and I need a favor. When can we call you?” I’d expected this. None of my elder siblings are doing well financially, and they’ve exhausted all other loan options, both from family and the bank. I figured they would text me, ask me to loan them a few thousand, and promise to pay it back when they could figure things out. I was absolutely willing to pitch in a few thousand, and had even considered giving them some of my tutoring jobs so they could make some extra cash. I was not, however, expecting them to demand I GIVE them all the money (close to $40,000) I’d made from the ages of 14-18. The exact statement my mom had made was “You made that money under our roof. We were the ones who allowed you to work, so you only have it because of us anyway...We bought you food and clothes for 18 years. That money is only a fraction of what you owe us...” and so on.I said that food, clothes, and shelter were the very minimum, it’s what they signed up for when they chose to become parents, I didn’t ask for any of it, etc. They responded by telling me that if it wasn’t for them, I wouldn’t have the life I have today. I said they were being ridiculous, and hung up. Since that day, both (along with two of my siblings) have continuously hounded me about giving them what is “rightfully theirs.” My siblings, who have never been asked to give them money, are still professing that it’s my job as their kid to take care of them. I told them they wouldn’t see a cent of my hard-earned money, and have no right to make such a request.I’m torn. I feel awful for refusing to help them out, but on the other hand, this was their fault. I feel I shouldn’t be responsible for fixing their mess. AITA?"
308,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to name our daughter Karen?,24232,jfdbk3,1527,"My wife and I recently found out we’re having a daughter. We hadn’t really talked about names before but we both agreed that each of us will retain veto power. When we did start discussing names, both of us wanted to name her after our late mothers. Her mom’s name was Karen and my mom’s name wasn’t a meme. I told her the baby can take my mom’s name as her first name and her mom’s name as a middle name, or have an entirely different name, but I can’t okay “Karen” as a first name in any case. She got offended because she just wants to honor her mother and thinks I have a problem with that. I just don’t want to set our daughter up to be bullied throughout her life. I told her I’d be fine with whatever first name she picks as long as it doesn’t lead to the baby being picked on later in life, but she’s pretty insistent on Karen.Edit: Wow, I didn’t expect this to blow up. I thought I’d delete this since this issue is pretty much resolved now but you guys are clearly enjoying this, so I thought I’d provide an update. We had a talk about this and why she had such an emotional reaction to my veto. Ever since her mom died suddenly when she was only fourteen, she’s wanted to name her first daughter after her and she didn’t really ever consider that the meme might be a potential obstacle. By that point, I’d thought about it for a while and realized that, as many of the comments have pointed out, Karen likely won’t be a meme by the time she’s old enough to feel its impact. So I told her I’ll recant my veto but we should still reconsider it because it still has potential complications and we might just come up with a better tribute. While exchanging ideas, we realized that both our mothers very coincidentally had the exact same middle name, Elizabeth (well mine had two middle names, and Elizabeth was one of them, but still). It seemed completely perfect to both of us so we’re going with it. Thanks for all your inputs!"
309,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling a friend's bf her intentions of getting pregnant?,24219,i2h8u6,1663,"A couple years ago, a close friend, Ashley, started a long-distance relationship with a guy, Chris. He has been really good to her and after meeting in person a few times, they decided to move in together. I was super happy for her as she had a few bad relationships over the years and it was nice to see her in a healthy one. That joy faded the last couple months before she moved a few states over to be with him.The issue isn't her moving, but that she repeatedly joked about having a baby from Chris. At first, I accepted it as jokes, but over time I realized Ashley was serious.For context, Ashley has two children from a previous previous relationship, ages 10 and 12. Chris absolutely doesn't want kids. He told her this at the start and anytime she hinted possibly wanting more, he shot it down, saying it was a deal breaker. Now, Chris is more than willing to accept her children as her own, because he loves her and after meeting her kids, them as well. He's accepted that they are a package deal with her, and since they are at an age where they are semi-independent, it's not an issue for him.To me, Chris is a real bro for taking on her kids without issue. Hearing Ashley say she wants a baby out of him, ""one way or another"", bothered me to no end. It's hard enough to find a partner that treats you well and accepts children that aren't their own. To find one that does and then talk about plotting to force a baby seems gross and manipulative.Before her move, I had sat down with Ashley, trying to talk sense into her. At first she resisted, but finally it seemed she understood how shitty it would be. After I felt like she had understood, I put the issue behind me and helped support her thru the hassle of moving.A few days after she left, I got a call from a mutual friend who delves into the Wiccan/Metaphysical realm. She was distraught and confessed to me that shortly before Ashley's move, Ashley had come to her asking for a fertility spell. This friend didn't feel comfortable about it and refused. When pushed, she said she cast a spell for a healthy and honest relationship, but told Ashley it was for fertility.As you can imagine, I was livid. I messaged Ashley, confronting her about what I learned and she laughed it off as she was desperate, but magic is fake anyway, so what's the harm? She then let it slip, that since Chris was planning on getting a vasectomy in a few months, she had poked holes in their condoms as a last ditch effort.At that point, I couldn't stay silent. I gathered up screenshots of all the conversations over the last few months and sent them to Chris. He understandably freaked out and kicked her out. Now, Ashley hates me because she was kicked out after a huge move and didn't have a job or money to make it back. She said I'm a terrible person for putting her and her kids out on the street.Am I the asshole here? Should I have kept quiet?"
310,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my transsexual ex-wife to dress more appropriately?,24180,di6zz9,323,"My former husband (42) came out as a transsexual woman last year. As a male he had recently started to get into crossdressing but assured me it was just a fetish, so I was taken by surprise when he came out as he was always a very traditional, masculine guy. She (now Laura) has not started HRT yet but is living fulltime as a woman. Laura and I no longer live together but we share custody of my son (10).Ever since I moved out and Laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. She's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. Laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.I am fine with what Laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. Recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the ""drag queens son"".I tried to talk about this privately to Laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. My son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. The moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. People were obviously listening and when I gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, Laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because I was jealous of her confidence. To make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that I was a piece of shit for saying what I was. My son and I left in tears but Laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.Ever since then I've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and I was a bad person for asking Laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years. I'm extremely shaken by having a group of complete strangers step in and wonder if I've gotten old and out of touch. It just breaks my heart to see my son becoming so withdrawn and upset over this. AITA for speaking to my ex this way?"
311,Not the A-hole,AITA for making a fake diary entry to catch my stepmom?,24153,i2lo6g,883,"I (17F) have been quarantined with my dad and step mom. My mom is a doctor so she was super paranoid about my family living with her during the pandemic, but as things where I live are settling down she let us come stay with her again. My stepmom has known me for two years and our relationship has always been weird. She’s a nice person but she can be pretty mean and childish if we do something she doesn’t like. She also has a tendency to run to our dad if she hears something bad about us. Long story short, I have a diary and I keep a lot of private stuff in it. Dad called me a few days ago (we were visiting with our mom) saying he has to talk to me when I come back. Apparently I was in trouble because of something I apparently said to stepmom. When he told me what she said I said, I immediately recognized it because I wrote it in my diary. I realized a lot of the stuff I wrote down was stuff she was telling him, so I decided to come up with a plan to see if I was write. I wrote a fake entry basically saying stuff I would never do in a million years and set the trap.Dad calls me while out visiting with friends, and when I come back he grounds me for what I “did”. Stepmom comes in later, apologized and said it sounded “concerning” and she had to tell. I told her it was fake, knew she read my diary and refused to speak to her. My dad came in and tried to talk to me and I told him that stepmom was reading my diary and he didn’t believe me. Now I’m with my mom, and I don’t know if what I did was fair. I felt it was the only way to prove my point and I didn’t know what else to do. AITA?Edit: wow thank you so much for the award! I honestly didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did, but I just want to thank all of you for your support and ideas. A lot of people have been saying to either get a licking diary or an online diary, so I'm looking into that. in the mean time I am currently staying with my mom and I am trying to as long as possible. Overall, I just want to thank you for the kind messages (and bright ideas) that you've given me. Reddit is truly magical <3"
312,Not the A-hole,AITA for yelling at a little girl to get out of my face,24143,c6t9kj,3149,"My newborn's pediatrician is always so crowded in terms of size of waiting room versus number of people waiting. It requires a certain amount of etiquette re: controlling your fuck kid, because there are no toys, no play area, no real space for shenanigans. Enter lady with four kids: A newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). She really really should have brought an iPad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. The mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. Accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. Several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).Her kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. She was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. Ffs at one point when I wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. My newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and I DID NOT feel like entertaining some strange kid. I tried being polite about it ""Sweetie where's your mommy?"" -points to mom- ""Ma'am!"" -points to kid- The lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. Rinse and repeat. I told her she needed to stay with her mom. Little punk deadass says ""I don't wanna"" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. Finally, I'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record ""why is your baby crying? Why is your baby crying! make him stop! I don't like that"" And her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. So now I'm out formula, kid still screaming, and I have a huge mess that I don't have a great way to clean up. I'm at my wits end. I raise my voice at this kid. ""LOOK WHAT YOU DID. I AM NOT YOUR MOM, I AM NOT YOUR BABYSITTER. YOU ARE BOTHERING ME. GET OUT OF MY FACE!!"" People looked at me like I was the biggest bitch on earth. A lady speaking Spanish actually did call me a bitch. The little girl starts crying. I'm not apologizing. The mom confronts me, I tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill I'm prepared to die on.So reddit, AITA?"
313,Not the A-hole,AITA: For not wanting to hide my period from my step-brothers like my step-mum wants me too?,24134,clga5g,2850,"I (F20) recently had to move back in with my dad, step-mum and 2 of my step-brothers (15 and 17). The last time I lived here was 2-3 years ago. Back then I remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my room (on the other side of the house) because she didn’t want her boys to see it. Now it’s not like I was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. Anyway I never stopped using the toilet bin. Now I’m back she’s started a new thing. Moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that I keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when I’m on my period, to under the sink zipped up. I personally think I absolutely should not be hiding the fact I have a vagina and it bleeds. Her boys will grow up thinking it’s gross and something that needs to be hidden. I would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. And I just want to be comfortable in the house I’m living in.Edit: for more info, this isn’t a random house I’ve moved back into. I’ve lived here since I was 3 before my parents got divorced when I was 7. My step mum and her kids moved in when I was 12(ish). I moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons. So this is just as much my house as it is hers, arguably more."
314,Not the A-hole,AITA for disinviting my brother to my wedding after he told me “being gay is wrong”?,24125,hqmqs3,1347,"Little backstory: I’ve been out of the closet since I was 17, in 2007. When I came out, people in my family said some pretty hurtful things, which I totally expected, being from a southern Baptist family in... god, it hurts to admit this but.. Florida😫. But my older brother at the time seemed very receptive, surprisingly. He told me that if my Dad ever gave me any trouble, to call him and he’d talk to him. That was really the last time we talked about it. Flash forward 13 years (I’m 30) and I’m getting married to my fiancé Scott next year in April (if covid so graciously allows). I started putting a package together of fun things from my brother And I’s childhood, all with the intention of asking him to be my best man. However, he called me two weeks ago, claiming he’s wanted to “talk to me about this for a long time”He went into the long tangent about how being gay is wrong and isn’t “what god wants”. He said he thinks Scott is a nice guy and he loves me, but he doesn’t think it’s right that we’re getting married. It was quite a shock as Scott and I have stayed with him multiple times when we visit my hometown. To top it off (and what hurts perhaps the most), he said my three old niece, whom we ADORE, won’t be coming to the wedding because he didn’t “want to have to explain to her what was going on here”.Notice he only said that SHE wasn’t coming to the wedding. I think he fully expected to still be invited after this. His wife, whom he started dating when I was 12, feels the same apparently. My whole dad’s side of the family feels the same way they do, but I’ve already written them off mostly in my mind. My mother is beyond pissed and upset at them. I think what upsets me the most is a sense of betrayal. They were my safe spot in the family. I felt like because they’re close to my age and younger and went to college, they would understand and it wouldn’t be a big deal to them. I almost feel a bit embarrassed because Scott comes from a wonderful Italian Catholic family and they’ve never been anything less than loving and supportive. I told them that, on what is supposed to be one of the happiest days of my life, if they or anyone else is sitting in the audience and in the back of their mind thinking that what we’re doing is wrong or not right, they should just stay home. I know my brother and family love me, but it feels up to a point, conditional, and limited. I told them that they learned being gay is wrong, they weren’t born not liking gay people. So they can unlearn it, if they were willing. But I don’t think that’s going to happen.Edit: okay, legit did not expect this many responses. Been getting some interesting negative feedback. All I will say is that I was genuinely interested in hearing if anyone had an idea somewhere in between “youre the asshole, he’s family. Invite him” and “he’s the asshole, fuck him. Don’t invite him”. I’m a compromising centrist at heart, but wasn’t sure I could see where that could fit here on my own. And no my story isn’t fake. I recorded the conversation"
315,Not the A-hole,"WIBTA if I told my family that our ""secret family recipe"" came from the side of a can?",24133,e6e0fm,2812,"Growing up every year around the holidays my mom would make fudge. The story was this amazing fudge recipe came from her grandma who snagged it from a famous candy maker.  My mom didn't get the recipe until she was an adult and we were always told that we couldn't have it until we were 30. In my late teens my mom asked me to help make the fudge with her a few times. The recipe is very simple and this was all the exposure I needed to memorize it. I've never once needed to write the recipe down. It came out that I had the recipe early and my mom and her mom were both outraged. I was given many warnings against sharing family secrets and told they were disappointed at my sneaking around them. I've never shared the recipe with anyone besides my brother and sister. I don't have the same feelings about recipe hoarding, but I followed tradition. However even now, 15ish years later, I'll get comments about how they don't entirely trust me since I came by the recipe dishonestly. Tonight I was reading an article about a chef doing research on secret family recipes for pickled herring. He managed to get copies of hundreds of recipes-200 of them were identical. He traced them back to a cookbook from the 1960s. This got me thinking about our family recipe. After not much googling at all I found ""our"" exact recipe on the website for an evaporated milk company. They apparently have also printed the recipe on cans over the years. This leads me to believe that either my grandma or her mother actually got the recipe from a can and lied about it's origin. I think this is hilarious and want to share the information. We've been so secretive about a recipe that's in public domain!  There's really no reason to hoard it anymore. Would I be the asshole if I shared this knowledge with my mom?"
316,Not the A-hole,AITA for ignoring my mom asking me to get involved with her new family after I got rich?,24110,bnr2gy,2143,"My mom left my dad when I was 17 (I’m 29 now) and had a new boyfriend literally straight away. We all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. She had 2 more kids with this guy. When my mom and dad broke up I moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. The major reason for this was because she told me to leave as I kept fighting with her new dude. I really did NOT want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and I was really upset that she didn’t give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. When she told me to leave...Something in me changed and I am still unable to forgive her. That solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. And my sister and mom were CLOSE so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. Since I was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc I like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. They gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that’s much they believed in me) and basically, I majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. The profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, I’m living a life I never thought would be for a shmuck like me. I moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we’ve started a new life. I am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and I’m grateful so much bc I was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. For the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. She is getting increasingly more insistent that I go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don’t. She keeps telling me that ‘even if I don’t forgive her I should look out for the kids as they’re innocent in all this’ AITA because day to day I have no interest in helping her or her family? IMO she made her bed and she can lay in it but the guilt eats me alive sometimes. I just can’t forgive her though."
317,Not the A-hole,AITA for “period shaming” my daughter?,24047,i65e2r,1666,"I’m a 41M single dad with a 13 year old daughter Lacey. My wife died in childbirth and it’s just been me and Lacey all her life. My sister has been a big help in raising Lacey, and we do keep in contact with her maternal grandparents. The issue started a couple of months ago when Lacey started her period. I knew this day would come so I spoke to my sister, my female best friend and my mother in law to be well prepared. I gave her the talk with her grandmother and aunt there, I buy her pads and tampons, I even have midol and heating pads ready for Lacey when she needs them. The problem began when I began to notice a smell coming from Lacey’s room. I went in to investigate and found pads and tampons openly disposed of in her wastebasket. I checked her bathroom and it was worse. She had her bloodstained undergarments in the tub.I took out her trash and did my best to get rid of the smell, but I didn’t know what to do with the underwear in the tub. Later, I noticed bloodstains on the couch. It took a while of cleaning but I got them out. I figured that was the end of that.It happened again last month, when I noticed Lacey’s room was stinking again. And I saw she didn’t even wash the underwear from before. The bathroom was unbearable at this point. Then earlier this week, I saw bloodstains on the couch again.I sat Lacey down and told her that she had to learn to properly dispose of her feminine hygiene products and wash her underwear as the smell was becoming too much. And to be careful of getting bloodstains on the couch or anywhere she sits. I also noticed her sheets had a lot of bloodstains and brought this up too. I also let her know that it was okay to get blood on things as long as she washed them, and I wouldn’t be upset if I saw her bloodstained items being washed.Lacey immediately blew up at me saying that periods aren’t gross and that I was period shaming and that I needed to educate myself on menstruation. I then got texts from my sister and MIL scolding me for making Lacey feel ashamed of her bodily functions. But I honestly wasn’t trying to convey that periods are gross. I was trying to convey that her hygiene needed to be addressed and that the smell was becoming unbearable. I just wanted to make sure that Lacey knew how to properly dispose of pads and tampons without it smelling, and that I wouldn’t be annoyed if she washed her bloodstained items AITA here? Was I period shaming my daughter?EDIT:  so I’ve mentioned it in a few comments. I talked to my sister and mil and explained my side. They apologized for misunderstanding and like you guys, have given some good cleaning tips and they’ll talk to Lacey and help her out with the pads and tampons tooEDIT2: so many people here have suggested it and I’ve asked Lacey if her period pain is unbearable or just normal cramps, and left the choice to her as to whether or not she wants to see a specialist but the option is there for her!EDIT3: We have washed the sheets with hydrogen peroxide and purchased some oxyclean for future instances should we need it. Many of you have also suggested period underwear, which again, I have asked her aunt and grandmother about and they’ll be able to give her more info about those as well as different hygiene products she can use."
318,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my to be granddaughter in law some lewd advice after my family asked for some ‘grandmotherly wisdom’?,24024,gfvw7h,1758,"My good friend Gracie made me aware a few weeks ago of a phrase that made both of us laugh til we were sore, a dirty phrase which is ‘the key to a successful marriage is to keep a mans stomach full and balls empty’. Both of us are in our 70’s and jovial and sprightly if I may say so. I liked the phrase – it was funny, and it stuck around in my mind. My family are aware I have a filthy sense of humor and I do like to laugh. My eldest grandson is in his 30’s and recently proposed to his fiancée, they made us aware over it via a family FaceTime session. It was very sweet and everyone was in good spirits, drinking, etc. My granddaughter and daughter pushed me to say a few words in the way of advice, but frankly I wouldn’t know, and I’m not one to give advice anyway. my grandsons fiancée said no no, give us some wisdom! So I said the phrase and the only people who burst out laughing were my grandson and his fiancée. Everyone else looked mortified and my granddaughter immediately started berating me. I told my friends this and they think it wasn’t a big deal but my granddaughter and daughter have texted to say I was inappropriate and ruined a moment."
319,Not the A-hole,AITA for being cold to my ex-fiancé and demanding a paternity test after her infidelity?,24023,b65vaq,1440,"So, right now I'm in kinda a shitty situation. I've been treating my ex-fiance pretty cold and demanding a paternity test for the child she's caring. All of my friends are saying i'm being a major asshole but I don't feel that way, heres the story.I knew my ex for almost 10 years. We go back all the way to high school and have been friends. After we graduated I said fuck it and asked her out and we became a couple. We dated for almost 6 years before she came to me and told me she was pregnant. I won't lie, I loved her at the time and this was actually quite exciting to me so i proposed. She, however, seemed super worried. I sat down and talked with her about it. I told her that even if she did decide to terminate the pregnancy I would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. She was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.These past 7 months have been a roller coaster. She moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. That was until a few weeks ago. An old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. I was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. This guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. It turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. He is not lying about this. He sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. I was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. Along with this, he sent me a string of Facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because I make more money that the real father and she would rather I care for it.Suffice to say, I was fucking pissed. I confronted her, she cried, I cried, it was a mess. In the end I broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. She's in the process of moving out now but I have not said a single word to her. I have pretty much told her that I want her out of my life. I also demanded a DNA test the minute the child is born. If it is mine, i'll help her support it. If not, then I am never seeing her again.I've been cold to her. Her and her parents has tried multiple times to ""work it out"" with me but I've refused any contact with them. At one point she got all of her friends together to try to talk to me and I kicked them out of the apartment with threats of calling the police. Any time she's tried to ""Reconcile"" i've shut it down,My friends are saying i'm in wrong here. According to them she's pregnant and because of that I should at least be helping her till the baby is born even if it isn't mine. I disagree fully. But I could be wrong. Am I letting my own emotions hide the fact from me that i'm an asshole?"
320,Not the A-hole,WIBTA If I sued my boyfriend’s elderly mother and pressed charges against her?,23984,l640cc,1833,"Okay, I know how this sounds. Please hear me out at least.I’ve been with my boyfriend for 11 years, since I was 15. His mother has HATED me since the first day she met me. She hated me due to my ethnicity, (Kosovan Albanian) she hated me due to my career, I work as a model and she decided that makes me an empty headed, vain, shallow person. Then when I told her I still planned to go to university alongside my career she said I was doing it to “impress” my boyfriend. I’ve since left uni with a distinction and her new reason to hate me is… I try too hard? She has also insisted I’ve cheated on him throughout our entire relationship which is a ridiculous claim, I’ve never even kissed another man in my whole LIFE. I have zero desire to cheat and never will.Late last year she attempted to void the insurance on my boyfriend’s motorbikes, she tried to do this under my name so, hypothetically, when he was arrested for riding with no insurance and called his insurance company, I’d get the blame. After this happened my boyfriend and I agreed to cut her out, however it hasn’t stuck, she left my boyfriend alone and respected his wishes for NC but she’s continued to contact and harass me.This leads to the last few weeks, my boyfriend works as a motorcycle test rider and he got in an awful motorbike crash while working, as such I now need to care for him. I’m okay with that and I’m focusing on seeing it as an opportunity for us to get closer, it’s been nice honestly. However his mother has been AWFUL to me. She’s called me litany of terms. From things as tame as stupid to things as awful as a “Nasty Serbian half breed.” I’m not Serbian and she’s well aware that calling a Kosovan a Serb is offensive. I tried to block her so she started making new iMessage accounts and began to continuously harass me via those accounts.Then came Friday night. The police turned up at our door. I was pretty confused and was quickly told they were there to do a welfare check as they’d received “multiple” claims of horrific abuse I was apparently putting my poor boyfriend under. Obviously they quickly discovered he was fine, albeit grumpy and they left. I know for a fact it was his mother, some of the details the police mentioned made that obvious. I’m now at a point where I’ve realised I literally cannot do this. I’m going to press charges against her for the insurance and harassment (it’s a crime in the UK) and I’m likely going to sue her for damages, for the sake of my mental health I need to do this. I don’t want to be a victim and she needs to be forced to stop. I have mentioned my intentions to her if she doesn’t back off and she’s pretty much mocking me and saying I won’t. I absolutely will. I just feel like this morally may make me an awful person. She sucks, I know this, however she’s old and miserable enough as is and I feel like doing this may ruin whatever small amount of life she has left. It feels like it may be too far. I really don’t know though and I genuinely cannot be objective here.WIBTA here if I did this?Edit: When I say I need to care for my boyfriend, I mean he’s essentially immobile, he’s not being unsupportive, he’s just barely able to take care of himself, let alone battle his mother too."
321,Not the A-hole,AITA for not helping my son and his wife with my grandson?,23967,c9gtj9,934,"Necessary information: When my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. After a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. Except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.That was when my husband and I stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. When she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and I still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. Once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.Now, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. He's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. My daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. Since I'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. I asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. I asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. I also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.He thought of asking me because I had helped his brother all those years ago and it would ""basically be the same thing"". I told him that no, it was not. I was 42 then and I'm 59 now, I didn't had the health issues that I do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. Also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  I would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. Now he thinks I'm playing favorites and that I'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but I think I'm just being reasonable.Edit: While it is nice to know that I'm not the asshole, my son has found the post and is now very mad at me for ""shaming him and his wife on the internet"". I disagree as it was not my intent and I never disclosed any information that could be used to identify them both. He's also very mad about being called an asshole. While he is my son, I find that he needs a wake up call since my conversation with him in private about the issue only made him behave like a spoiled child and his reaction to me looking for input as an anonymous person was to call and yell at me on the phone. I'll let this post stay up and let this be a lesson to him."
322,Not the A-hole,AITA for shutting down talk about having kids with “purposely controversial statements?”,23956,hklj0n,1582,"   Our region has done well handling COVID, so my husband and I had a small group of family over for a backyard BBQ a month ago.We’re the only ones in the family “left” who don’t have kids. We’re not going to. We prefer our lives as mountaineers. His family thinks we'll change our minds. Mind you, husband had the snip.MIL jokingly mentioned that maybe with all the “alone time” we’d be giving the family a little bundle of joy. We shut the idea down with good humor. She kept pressing, and SIL chimed in with “Come on, this is the perfect time to get started!”Husband: We’ve talked about this already. Let’s drop it.MIL: Well, I don’t care. Husband: Again, drop it.MIL: I hope it happens!Husband: Thankfully we’re very careful.MIL: Accidents happen. It isn’t always up to you.Husband: Yes, it is. I had a vasectomy. Like I said, discussion over. Can we move on?We do, but MIL and SIL are whispering with each other and shooting glances, looking at their phones, etc. BIL and I are laughing about something dumb on TV, seems like everything is fine.Until SIL says, “Vasectomies can fail, you know! It’s not a 100% thing.”It gets quiet, MIL & SIL look smug.MIL: So there’s still a chance you can get pregnant, you can NEVER be sure!Husband & I lock eyes. Party’s over.Me: That is exactly what abortions are for.Cue screaming and yelling, I’m an evil, cruel bitch, what kind of monster, etc. His family are all supposedly pro-choice.Husband yells at them to GTFO, don’t talk to me like that. MIL gets up in his face and yells that I said I would kill her grandbabies, how could he stand to hear it.Husband: And I would hold her fucking hand the entire time because it’s what BOTH of us would want.Party’s over. Cue FB shitstorm. MIL’s post tags us, says: “We were having a nice family get together and OP and Husband had bait us with purposely controversial statements. Every mom lives to see her babies have babies. Yesterday I was told that my cruel DIL would murder my grandbabies if she got pregnant and my son would hold her hand while she did it.”I do not feel like we’re assholes, even for how we handled the situation. There was no getting through to them without being direct and final. This isn’t the first time we tried to get them to drop the subject. However, other family members really think we are in the wrong and that I went over the line. Reddit, we are the assholes here?"
323,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my brother in law he's a walking advertisement for abortion?,23913,j82zzp,1850,"My wife was more than five months pregnant when we learned that our daughter would not survive outside the womb. We were devastated, as this was a very wanted pregnancy. My wife made the difficult decision to have an induction abortion. The procedure itself went as expected, and she is physically fine. Emotionally, we are both still grieving. I was with her the whole time.Yesterday, we had a family gathering. My family knew we were expecting, and I had the horrible job of telling them we had lost the baby. My parents and sister expressed their sympathies. However, bil, who is extremely pro-life, throughout the night told my wife repeatedly her that she was a murderer and that she killed her own daughter, and all sorts of other awful things that made her feel much worse. I was appalled when I caught him doing this, and my wife was on the verge of breaking down all over.I yelled at him, pointing out how he had gotten a DUI in the past that put another person in the hospital, how he was working a low-paying job selling cigarettes that kill thousands of people every year at a convenience store, and how I had needed to bail him and my sister out financially more than once for medical reasons. Then I ended with ""If anything, you're a walking advertisement for abortion. Your mother probably wishes she had aborted you.""I took my wife home, furious. Then later, I got a call from my sister. She apologized initially, saying she realized what her husband had said was out of line, but then tried to justify it by pointing out that he was raised to believe abortion was wrong. I should have been more understanding, and it was unfair of me to point out his past struggles when he had been doing better recently. I cussed her out and hung up, but now I'm wondering if I did go too far? AITA for basically telling my brother in law he should have been aborted?Update: thank you all so much for the support. My sister called me a few hours ago, and we talked. It turns out she didn't know what he had actually said. He made it seem like he had just said he disagreed with abortion, which I would say is still unacceptable to tell grieving parents. But when I told her what he actually said, she was horrified. She apologized profusely and is now considering leaving him (there were a lot of other red flags in their relationship). She's now fully on our side and can't believe her husband could be so vile"
324,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my mom we haven’t had a good relationship in a long time and I wanted to go live with my dad?,23905,l26p6d,1549,"I (16F) used to have a good relationship with my mother. That has since crashed and burned since she dated and married my stepdad “Gary” six years ago. Gary treats his son “Ian” (19M) like he’s the center of the universe and expects my mother to as well, so she does. Anything Ian wants, Ian gets and that usually comes at the expense of me. Ian wanted my room when they moved it? I was forced to go to another room to “make the transition easier for everyone.” Ian wanted a car for his 16th birthday? I didn’t get braces for another year. Ian wanted to go on an expensive trip for Spring Break? I had to give up Volleyball to make it happen. Ian wanted to have his side of the family over? I was expected to find somewhere else to be, since I wasn’t family. My mother just went along with all of this and acted like it shouldn’t affect me at all.My dad was overseas for a long time, and we used to FaceTime and he was so upset by what he was hearing. He’s home now and he’s offering to have me come live with him. I’m not seeing a reason not to go, and so I told my mom I wanted to go live with my dad. She predictably freaked out and asked why I’d want to do that and said that we had such a good relationship, she didn’t understand how this came so out of the blue. I told her that we haven’t had a good relationship since she blindly decided to follow Gary’s lead and give Ian anything he wanted, and it always came at my expense. My mom tried to argue so I said, I also wanted to leave because she let them kick me out of my own house because ”I wasn’t family” so I was going to go live with someone who was. My mom started crying and said she wouldn’t let me go, so I told her that my dad was willing to go to court over it and I was old enough to be able to say where I wanted to be. She’s been a crying mess since I told her, and Gary is being a jackass about how awful I’m being.  Here’s where I might be the asshole. He was bitching at me about how terribly I’m treating them and how I’m not thinking about them at all. I asked why should I, he never thought of me when he was taking things from me to give to his kid. I said let’s face facts here, you don’t care about me, what you care about is losing the child support you spend on your son. He sort of went slack jawed and I walked off. My dad said my mom called and threatened to take him to court, so he said he’d see her there. Now she’s panicking because she realized he is planning on taking her to court over this. Mom and Gary of course think I’m the asshole for “making things hard” for everyone, but my dad and grandparents say to leave and never look back. AITA for wanting to get away from this situation?"
325,Not the A-hole,AITA for how I responded to a senior HR member accusing me of taking drugs at work?,23899,kbp9mo,1126,"Background: I have diagnosed bipolar disorder. I’ve been on medication over a year and it’s the best damn decision I’ve ever made. That being said, I have a tendency to go off my meds when I’m manic. It’s not fun when the meds wean out of my system and I go nuts. In order to not sabotage myself, I take my meds everyday at 11 am. It helps me settle myself for the rest of the day, and keeps me on a strict schedule. Incident:My workplace has shifted online fully. We had a zoom call yesterday with HR to update everybody on COVID measures going forward for the upcoming quarter and it was about 30 or so people on the call. HR has been anal retentive about people keeping their videos on throughout the meeting nobody is allowed to move out of the screen. The meeting began at 9 am. 11 am comes around and my alarm buzzes to remind me about the medication. I moved slightly out of frame and took them while still on the call. I didn’t think anybody noticed but apparently this senior HR person we’ll call Q, did. The meeting wraps up at 12 noon, and as we’re all getting ready to sign off, Q tells me to stay behind after everybody leaves, in front of them. I found that unprofessional but held my tongue. Q then launched on this long diatribe about how I’m setting a “hostile work environment” by taking my meds during work hours, that I’m being neglectful of my duties, and that I’m “ruining my body” with them. When I finally got a chance to respond, I said that the “drugs” I’m taking are prescription medication, and that I fail to see how the five seconds it takes me to take them is creating a hostile work environment. I said that my medical history is none of their business, and since they have failed to demonstrate any real harm in the situation, I didn’t feel like this discussion was warranted. Q looked like they’d swallowed sour milk and told me they’d be writing me up and that I was officially being warned for my behavior. I saw red and right after the call ended, sent an email to the head of HR (R) summarizing the conversation and refuting the warning/write ups. I stated the relevant legal protections accorded to employees in such situations and that I hoped R would address this fairly. R looked into the matter and I learned later that Q had been suspended without pay. A bunch of my coworkers caught onto what happened, and are now making it very difficult to work with them. Apparently Q was a popular person in the office and they felt that complaining to the head of HR was taking it too far. This entire situation feels utterly surreal and I can’t think of any reason why I’d be the asshole, but I’m facing an uncomfortable work situation and want to know if I need to apologize and smooth things over."
326,Not the A-hole,AITA for burning bridges with my in-laws at my husband's funeral?,23885,fegt59,1803,"I married ""Jake"" when we both were 19 - I know in hindsight that that was dumb, but it was common in the area. We're from an area with little in the way of opportunities, and while I did well enough to get scholarships and attend college, Jake decided to join the military. We talked extensively about this, and he was vocal in his intention to only join for one term to get the GI Bill and then get out and go to college.When I married him, Jake was a sweet, funny guy who enjoyed cooking and the only things he'd willingly hurt were deer. But after he joined, Jake changed. He got a lot angrier, in general. I'd never known him to have a temper, but he went from never raising his voice to yelling at his family and me when he didn't get his way, to less pleasant behavior when he was drunk. And oh how he drank. I have nothing against a beer with friends now and then, but after joining the military Jake was drinking constantly. His sense of humor got a lot cruder, too, ""Dirty little sheet heads!"" became his favorite punchline.The final straw was when we discussed his plans to get out and go to college since he was looking at whether to stay in or get out. He wanted to stay in. I reminded him he'd promised to get out. He'd been drinking, and things got ugly.The wives' club at the base was no help, so I started quietly looking into how to divorce Jake. Then, earlier this year, he died in a car accident. My only feeling was, honestly, relief. I went to his funeral and didn't say anything at the service, but at dinner Jake's little sister approached me and said she'd started dating a soldier and wanted to know if I had any advice. My advice? ""Don't. The military ruined Jake and turned the man I loved into a drunk, abusive asshole.""Jake's family predictably erupted in a firestorm, but more alarmingly to me, my own parents have taken their side.AITA?"
327,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to move?,23848,lv8rm1,1389,"My (f42) husband (m44) and I have been married for 21 years. We have two adult children (m22 and m24), one is in college out of state and the other is in the navy.When we first got married, my husband was in navy, and we spent the first 10 years of our marriage moving from place to place, wherever his new duty station was. I found it hard to make friends, and I could not keep a job, so I made a difficult decision and decided to be a SAHM. When he got out of the navy eleven years ago, he took a job and we moved. Three years in, he got offered a job in another part of the company, however, it was in another state, so we moved again. We stayed there for six years. I went back to college and got my degree and began looking for work. I found a job I liked in my field, and six months into working, he said he was offered a job with a new company and wanted to take it, but that would mean we would be moving almost 2,000 miles from where we were in a new state. I reluctantly agreed because the new state would have more job opportunities for me and we would be closer to our family, which is something that we have not had in many years. Last night my husband came up to me and said that there was a job opening in his company and he wanted to apply for it. It would mean a pay raise and better hours, but the caveat would be that we have to move again. We have been living in our new state for three years. I love it here. I have an amazing job and I am making great money. I finally have friends and am able to socialize. I told him that I am not moving again. Any time we have to move, he always leaves first and I end up being responsible for selling/packing the house, and I am not doing that again. Our sons college is only 2 hours from here, we can see him twice a month. If we move, that means we would have at least a days drive and would only be able to do that once or twice a year!Now my husband is upset with me and guilt tripping me because he claims I do not  support him. I told him that was BS because I spent most of my life moving from place to place to support his career. He told me that I am selfish and he is just trying to provide for us. I told him that we are more than comfortable where we are now, and that if he truly wants to take the job, he will be going alone.AITA for refusing to move again?*post update*I hope that this is allowed. I apologize for not being able to respond to everyone. And thank you all for your kindness and replies. To answer some questions.1. My husband and I have been together since I was 15 and he was 17. He joined the navy right after graduation from high school when he was 18 and I was 16, but had to wait two years before we could marry. 2. He works for a company that has plants in 15 states. He is currently in middle management, but if he wants to advance his career further, he would need to go to another plant out of state. 3. Financially we are more than comfortable. We do not need anymore money. 4. My son plans to stay in the place he is after college. We have a great relationship with him and he comes home one time a month and we see him one time a month. My other son comes home on leave whenever he can and stays with us. We are very close to both of the boys. 5. I talked to my husband again tonight and told him quite firmly that moving again was not an option for me. The area he wants to moves has very little jobs in my field and specialty in that area and I would need to commute more than an hour one way for a job versus the 20 minutes I have here. We are sandwiched between two major cities, and if we move we would be an hour from the most major city. I would also have to take a massive pay cut and work a menial job to build a new network to find employment in my field. 6. My husband is disappointed in me for not wanting to leave. He left to stay with a friend because he “needs to think.” He doesn’t understand why I would force him to turn down an opportunity to advance his career further. I told him to take all the time he needs, but I am not moving again. I said I would revisit the possibility when I am ready for retirement in 15 years but no sooner."
328,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my boyfriend pay less on bills due to a new purchase because he wouldn’t let me when I made less money than him?,23838,lozxuk,1419,"My boyfriend of two years and I live together. We split expenses 50/50 when it comes to rent, groceries, utilities, things for our house, etc. we both make about the same money working full time. We keep our finances such as our own vehicles, doctor bills, cell phone bills, etc separate. My boyfriend recently made an irresponsible and unnecessary purchase. To keep it short, I won’t go into details but it was something he absolutely did not need, just wanted and it has made his disposable income significantly less. This has been a sore subject between us. The other day he asked me to sit down and talk. He told me since he paid more on his personal bills a month, he felt like we needed to adjust how much we each paid on shared expenses. So basically, he felt he should get to pay less.This made me mad for a few reasons. First, as I said, the purchase was absolutely not necessary by any means. And when we first started living together I made way less money than I do now. I worked part time at another job and made 12 less dollars on the hour than him. However, then he refused to budge on letting me pay less bills, so I budgeted and saved and always had everything paid despite that. So, I told him no. I told him he was not willing to pay more than me when I made way less money than he did, and the purchase was unnecessary and he knew it would make his finances difficult. If he couldn’t pay OUR bills, he needed to leave. He of course thinks I’m an asshole for not budging on the issues. I think it’s only fair. AITA here?Edit: it was a motorcycle"
329,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I reported my daughter’s teacher for not pronouncing her name correctly?,23833,jg5jp8,2262,"My daughter’s English teacher refuses to pronounce her name correctly. She has a Japanese name and we live in Japan.  Her name is Kanae, pronounced Kaa-Naa-EH.Recently, Kanae told me that her English teacher(an expat from America) at school calls her “Kah-Nye”. She told me that she told the teacher “My name Kanae. It’s three claps (syllables)”. But the English teacher told Kanae that she was incorrect, and that grammatically speaking that she , her teacher, was correct.During my daughters sports day I “confronted” the teacher . I explained that my daughter would like the be called “Kaa-naa-eh”. But she laughed and said she was pronouncing it the way it’s “supposed to be” but will try her best to remember.Today, my daughter told me the teacher still calls her Kah-Nye. My daughter is very very shy and it took a lot for her to correct her teacher the first time.  I’m considering going to the school in the  morning. But is that an over reaction?(For some clarity I am not Japanese, my wife is so our kids are mixed-race. Our kids are fluent in English and Japanese. )🧚🏿‍♂️🧚🏿‍♂️👉🏽Not like Kanye WestBut Kah. Plus Nye like Bill Nye 👈🏼:::::oh wow! I wrote this late at night and went to sleep. I didn’t expect it to get this much attention! Thank you for all of the responses. I can’t reply to them all. But this morning we couldn’t go(son had an earache) but we are going there after school ends. We asked our daughter if she wanted us to tell. She said that she didn’t care.  We don’t want the teacher fired, we just want our daughter respected in her classroom::⛩⛩Update: I’m not sure where else to place it:::But my wife and I went to the school today around 3:45pm. By then the English teacher in question had gone home. We told the principal everything that I’ve told you all and he was extremely apologetic. He did say that maybe it was a language barrier. But I reminded him that my daughter and I both told the teacher in English how to pronounce Kanae.So then the principal called her dispatch company (Interac it turns out). The same thing happened. The company apologized but tried to pass it off as a language barrier thing.More apologizes were issued when we told themwe spoke English. We were told that interac would speak to the teacher, and that they would handle it.They principal asked us to come to the school Monday morning. I’m hoping to talk to the teacher face to face on that day.❤️💚Final (maybe) update.  This morning I met with the school board, principal, the dispatch company, and the teacher in question! I honestly didn’t expect everyone there. It was very traditional Japanese apology. Deep bows from everyone (even the American teacher). She wrote (I think it was written for her because it didn’t sound natural and she made several mistakes)I don’t remember it word for word but it said “ I sincerely apologize to the (our family name) and most sincerely to Kanae(she said it correctly). I now realize how important names are to the Japanese people. Please accept my dearest condolences(yes this was actually said).”The teacher promised to treat Kanae with more respect.She also apologized for not respecting me during the sports day. Honestly the only “real” thing that she said is when Kanae was brought in and the teacher kneeled down and said “Kanae. I am really sorry”. It seemed heartfelt Kanae being Kanae made the teacher a cardI forgive her.  So does my daughter. I have no idea what is going to happen career wise however.  Her company seemed very very upset.But my daughter feels better Thank you all so much"
330,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling my family that if they want Thanksgiving, they'll have to get off their asses and plan it?",23817,k0e173,3117,"Usually for Thanksgiving, we head out to go see family. Someone else always hosts (we typically help ""sponsor"" the host by paying for clean-up, etc, our home is just too small to host the 30+ folks who typically show up through the day). This year that's obviously not happening.Other than us talking about not doing the usual, Thanksgiving didn't come up until yesterday. My kids have the week off from online school, and I was doing a puzzle with them before dinner when my husband walks in after work and says: ""So did we get a turkey?""I looked at him and said ""Well, I know I didn't. Did you?""He stared at me blankly and said ""No. What do you mean? Do we need to get one still? Is it being delivered?""I shrugged and said ""I don't know nothing about no turkey.""The kids and he looked so confused, so I helped them along and said ""I didn't buy anything. I didn't plan anything. No one said anything to me about Thanksgiving. Nobody offered to help meal plan, cook anything, do anything.""He blew up yelling at me about how I should have obviously known.I said, why? I've literally never planned or made a Thanksgiving dinner in my life. The most I've ever done was help clean up or maybe peel the potato. I asked him why didn't ***HE*** plan anything, why didn't the kids plan anything? Why is everyone waiting until the last minute and dumping it on me?He just sputtered and yelled and stormed off to his ""office"" and left me with the kids. We all had dinner, the kids cleaned up, and I was relaxing with some wine and a book after they all went to bed. My husband tore into me about how he can't believe I left this all to the last minute, now there will be no Thanksgiving, how could I know be heartbroken to do this to the kids, etc.So I just looked at him and said ""Why didn't you plan? Why did you wait to the last minute to ask me?""He told me I was being a fucking bitch for no reason and stomped off to go sleep in his office. He left without saying a word this morning. I followed up with my kids and asked them if they wanted Thanksgiving. They said they didn't care because the food isn't that good most of the time anyway.Before you ask, yup, I work as well. We split chores but there's no hardline. I do some, he does some. We both cook, and the oldest cooks as well. I just don't get why Thanksgiving is on my plate. Why, just because I'm a woman? Lmao fuck that.AITA?**ETA:** Thanks for the judgments, all. A lot of people seem to think that my kids are like, toddlers or something. They're old enough to help make the menu for dinners, help with cooking, etc. It's weird how many people came up with info here, like I was ""getting down on the floor playing"" rather than me and the kids... sitting at the table doing a puzzle.Anyway, I told my husband that if he wants to do some traditional Thanksgiving with all the fattening, carby, salty, beige food, he can go ahead and plan it and I'll help in the same capacity as always. If he wants me and the kids to cook something together (aka a normal, average Thursday) I'll continue with what was scheduled.The kids genuinely do not care. Thanksgiving doesn't mean anything to them. One of them has been asking for us to stay home for years. One of them barely touches the food as it, and the other one only likes to go so she can see her cousins, and she sees them all the time anyway. The middle kid already dug out another puzzle for us and they're just happy they're off school.Also, we don't do Christmas. Check your biases, folks. Don't leap to conclusions based on what you *want* to have happened."
331,Not the A-hole,"AITA For ""Ruining"" my kid's life after she ruined a dress?",23812,hfhlrg,4220,"Ex(31) and I(m32) had C, (F16) way too young. We're friendly co-parents. One big rule we share is if our daughter breaks something, she pays for it.Now, sis (27) and I are the only grandkids. Aunt never married. Instead, she worked with Gma and Gpa at their seamstry store, and took it over when they retired.Sis's girlfriend (29) proposed last year. Gpa offered to make FSIL a custom suit, which she was over the moon about. Gma had me ask Sis what her dream dress was and record the convo. Sis, thinking it was just between us, told me in great detail what her dream dress was, though said it was way too expensive, so she would get something much cheaper. Well, a few months later Gma surprised Sis with her dream wedding dress. It fot perfectly and everyone cried. Sadly, Gma recently passed away, which hit us all hard. Sis was devistated, but decided that the dress meant Gma would still be there with us at the wedding. The issue comes in with C. She's very large, much larger then Sis. Three days ago, we decided to go visit Sis and see how she was doing. It was great, but then C asked if she could try on the dress. Sis politely said no. C made a face, but dropped it. Later, we decided to go grab dinner. Sis and I went to pick up our orders, but C decided to stay and play with Sis's dog.We got back, and the dress was destroyed. C had apparently tried to get it on, popping some seams, and got stuck. Instead of waiting for help, she cut her way out. The dress was hacked to bits.Sis was devistated and asked us to leave. I grounded C, and called Aunt with some pictures, asking if it could be saved. She said there was no. She said she'd make a new one, but it wasnt the same. Then she dropped the bomb on me - Gma had hand sewed most of the dress, used super expensive fabric, and put almost 500 hours in making that dress, since it was the only family wedding we'd have. In total, the dress cost 12,000 dollars, give or take. C has about 15,000 saved from various jobs, as well as winning writing competitions. This was supposed to help her in college. I took her to the bank and set in motion transferring all the funds, since as her parent I still have control over it. $12k to Aunt to pay for the new dress. $3k to my sister's wedding, as an emotional distress tax. I explained exactly why this was happening to C, but she sobbed the entire time, asking what was she supposed to do for college and saying it wasnt her fault. I told her she could get a job if she didnt get a scholarship, and it was her fault for trying on the dress after she'd been told no, and for not waiting until we got back. A few popped seams could have been fixed. Hacking the dress to pieces couldnt. C told my ex, and while she agreed C was in the wrong after the full story, said I shouldnt have ""ruined her future"" for a ""free"" dress. I reminded her of our rule, and she still thinks I'm wrong. So, am I the asshole here?Edit - since people are mentioning they dont understand the 3k, that was to make up to my sister that C destroyed the last gift our dead grandma ever gave her. I consider that part of the price of destroying the dress, since even if Aunt remakes it, its lost a great deal of its sentinent value. I pointed out how young we has her because I wanted to explain how a 31 year old has a 16 year old kid. I do not resent having her, she's the best thing Ive ever done. I also brought up C's size because Sis has crohn's disease, and thus is very tiny. The dress was made her for size, and C is much larger then Sis. I love C as she is, but just holding the dress up, it was clear it wouldnt fit. The character count is very limiting.Edit 2 - to clarify, the money was C's ""have fun at college"" money, not her college fund. My ex and I are paying for whatever scholarships dont. When she was asking what she would do for college, she was askong what'd she do for fun and to buy things we didnt pay for. Again, the character count is very limiting, so i had to cut details to post.Edit 3 - So, I got off the phone with my ex about 20 minutes ago. At some of your suggestions, I sent her the pictures, and she freaked. She apparently didnt believe me when I said it had be hacked apart, and believed it was just a few torn seams. She was pretty much on my side after. She told me that she's spent the day badgering our daughter, asking her why she did what she did, and finally C cracked and said she was mad that Grandma wasnt alive to make her a dress, and that it was ""unfair"" my sister got a free beautiful dress as a reminder when my daughter got ""nothing,"" despite the many things she was given after the funeral. She tried it on, took it off when the seams popped, and then in anger hacked it apart. If she couldnt have a dress from Grandma, no one could. Her own words. Honestly, knowing she did it on purpose has just made things worse. The fact that she could be so cruel, thats not the daughter we tried to raise. She will be going to therapy, whether that's in person when local therapists start taking new clients again or on one of those apps people have mentioned. We need to talk about it more. Her punishment stands as is, though we're going to see how therapy goes. As for all the seamsters who have reached out, please know I'm touched by your kindness. I really am. My aunt is going to see if she can incorporate at least some of the fabric from the old dress into the new one, maybe at least try to save the beading, but if there's anything usable I'll reach out. I so so appreciate all of your offers, youre incredibly kind people. I have yet to talk to my sister, but I have talked to her fiance. Sis isnt doing well. The stress has caused a crohns flare up, so she's stuck in bed sick. Which, honestly, I'm not surprised. Crohns is often triggered by stressful events, so I was expecting it. I told fiance about Aunt making a new dress, and she promised to take the remains over to Aunt on Monday. She's thankful for us addressing the issue, but has asked for some space from Sis so she can recover and heal, and hopefully not end up in the hospital. As for the 3k, we'll see what my sister's state is in a few days. If she has to go to the hospital, then the money is forfit for her medical bills, since it was C's selfishness that put her there, so she can pay for it. If Sis does not end up in the hospital, then I'll consider giving it back after she's gone to therapy for a few months, if she's accepted what she did was wrong and worked to make ammends. We'll see what the next few monthd bring."
332,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my SIL that I don't care that her baby died and to leave me alone?,23770,ig6m0w,1827,"Me and SIL, Daisy, have been friends since High School (15 years ago). I started dating her brother, Dan, when we were all in college. Daisy married Matt sometime after I married Dan 10 years ago. Matt and Daisy wanted a baby and starting trying right after marriage but they were having a lot of trouble. I am talking multiple failed IVF's, multiple late term miscarriages (one of which was a stillbirth). The struggle went on for for 7 years. I have helped her immensely through everything, financially and emotionally. Matt is... unsympathetic sometimes. He behaves as if it's a batch of bad cookies and immediately guilts her into trying again. So, it always was up me and Dan to take care of her. Despite many talks from me and Dan, she remained married to him and kept trying again and again. We have had many offers to leave the state/country for a better job, but didn't because we were scared to leave her alone. 3 years ago, I got pregnant. We broke the new gently to Daisy one day. She got real quiet and then asked us to leave. Later, she sent me an email saying she doesn't want to see me or Dan anymore and that this is all too much. We tried to console her but didn't work, so gave her space. 2 weeks before I was supposed to give birth, Dan passed away in an accident. I don't have any family except for Dan and Daisy. Daisy refused to attend the funeral because she will have to see me. The day before the funeral and I called her and begged her to come. I didn't think that I would be able to go through that without her. She hung up on me and didn't attend the service. Soon after that, I gave birth and I decided to move to another state. I cut off all contact with Daisy and started fresh. Now, me and my daughter are very happy and we are enjoying a comfortable life. She attempted to contact me once I moved away but I ignored her. 2 weeks ago, she called from an unknown number and said she desperately wanted to talk to me. Turns out she finally got pregnant, had a baby boy who passed away 5 days after being born in NICU. Matt is also leaving her and screwed her over because of the prenup. She is basically broke and homeless days after losing a child. I just said ""Ok"". She then asked ""Are you really not going to say anything? You are really not going to help?""I pretty much said, ""I don't care about you. I don't care about your life. I don't care about Matt. I don't care that your baby died. Just leave me and my daughter alone."" and then hung up. Since then she has been sending me multiple emails and vm's stating how awful I am and how heartless and how much Dan would be disappointed. I continued to just ignore everything. So, AITA?. Edit: Please don't DM me about leaving a person homeless during pandemic. I am already aware of the fact. I don't care. No matter what anyone says I am not going to have any sympathy or help her in any way. I am only asking for a judgement on what I said and how I said it.Edit 2: I am getting a lot of annoying DM's because someone cross posted this somewhere else. Please stop. Edit 3: Please stop giving me unsolicited advise regarding changing my mind about helping her. That's not going to happen. If I wanted advice, I would have posted it in relationship_advice, not here. I only asked you to judge what I said to her and how I said it. I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ADVICE. So, please stop."
333,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to buy a coworker lunch,23742,jw1riz,1188,"I (23M) have a coworker (25M) who is a mooch. If you get something for lunch, he wants you to get him something too, but expects you to buy it for him because since you mentioned it, he says you offered. At first I thought maybe he had money problem, but then overheard him laughing and bragging to someone in another department about how he was able to scam lunches out of his coworkers, and he’s attempted to bully a free meal out of someone more than once. His general entitled attitude is one of the many reasons I don’t like him.So yesterday my girlfriend and I had lunch together. He overheard me confirming before I left and asked what I was bringing him and I said nothing. He said I brought it up, and I corrected him. No, I was confirming we were still good and he was eavesdropping on my conversation. He started complaining so I had if he gave me money for his food I’d bring him something but I wasn’t going to buy him food. He started complaining about it again and I got irritated and said no money no food, and then I left.When I got back my boss said my coworker complained I was being hostile. I told him what happened and how he’s constantly trying to weasel free food out of people, even some of the people he knows are struggling. So my boss asked around and several others collaborated what I said. My coworker got dragged into the office and now he’s pissed that I “narc’d” and how he was just kidding. Most of the office thinks he got what he deserved but a few think it wasn’t worth getting him in trouble over.Today no one he asked told him what they were doing for lunch, and he’s whining that we’re alienating him. I said he alienated himself because of his behavior. He said I’m an asshole, but I don’t really feel bad that a mooch who thinks it’s funny to scam his coworkers thinks I’m an asshole. My little brother is on here a lot and suggested I post though, so AITA?"
334,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my friend for a “boob-voyage” party?,23715,h79apz,1938,"A while ago, my doctor found a cancerous lump in my breast. Thankfully it was stage 1, but I did end up having a mastectomy. It was a stressful time, and when my friend was over a few days before my surgery, we got on the topic of the “boob-voyage” party from Jane the virgin. I asked her if she would throw me one of those parties to help me get my mind off it. I thought she would put together just a small girls night, but she went all out. She invited all of my friends and my boyfriend and had an array of boob paraphernalia. It was funny and lighthearted and meant a lot to me to get all that support from my friends.During my recovery, my boyfriend confronted me and said that he hated the boob party, he thought it was tacky, and he was offended that I hadn’t asked him to put something together instead. He said that we were supposed to be going through it together and I should have thought about his feelings and the fact that he doesn’t like parties and wouldn’t want to spend one of the nights leading up to my surgery like that. I told him that I’m sorry he felt that way, but it was really helpful for me and I was the one getting surgery and treatment. I told him I wanted to support him but my feelings had to take priority under those particular circumstances and the party helped me. He’s still angry at me for refusing to apologize for asking my friend to throw the party without asking how he felt about it first. It comes up now and again and he still wants me to apologize. AITA?"
335,Not the A-hole,AITA for moving all my stuff to my guest room after my husband refused to stop turning the light on at 3am?,23690,j195ol,2457,"My husband just got promoted to shift manager 3 weeks ago. This meant that his 10am-6pm shift has now been switched 4am to noon. He isnt a morning person AT ALL so most mornings he will start huffing and puffing as soon as his alarm goes off and he will instantly turn on our light and very loudly start looking for his work clothes.I have asked him several times to put clothes out the night before and he has yet to do so. I have also asked him to not turn the light on or be super loud. After all, when I worked at 5am I made sure to be respectful of him sleeping. So yesterday morning when he got up at 3am and flipped on the light, I grabbed my stuff and went to the guest room. He came in and asked what I was doing. I told him that since he didnt respect me sleeping, at all, that I would be staying in the guest room from now on. He made a comment about ""The light will only be on for 5 freaking minutes."" Which is not true. He turns the light on, finds himself clothes and then goes to take a shower without turning the light off. If I turn the light off, he will come back into the room after the shower and turn it on again to grab his socks and put on his shoes. (Which also pisses me off because shoes stay in the kitchen by the door and there's no reason he cant put them on at the table).Anyways, instead of understanding, he just got angry. Mainly because he is not a morning person and he doesnt like dealing with anything in the AM. So, while he was at work yesterday, I moved all my stuff into the guest room. Last night he practically begged me to sleep in the bedroom and promised to let me sleep. Well, this morning he flips on the fucking light again so I sit up and I'm like ""Are you kidding me right now?"" And he says ""I'm being quiet!"" As if that was the only issue. So I went into the guest room and locked the door. I told him I was staying in here from now on despite his efforts to sway me. He thinks I'm overreacting. AITA?EDIT FOR THE TROLLS OF REDDIT: I do in fact work. So your assumption that I dont is not only mislead but pretty ignorant. Also, the assumption that everything I have is due to my husband working, another ignorant statement. Not that it matters for the context of this post but I work 4pm to midnight. And cute little tid-bit, I'm the bread winner. I make nearly $5 more on my hourly wage. Take that info and shove it.Update: Thanks for all the awards and awesome feed back! I am in search of a (hopefully) light weight mask that one of you suggested. I hope it works!"
336,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting my parents to adopt another teenage girl,23682,gf4knq,2358,"I (15F) live with my parents (mid-40s) and my brother (9M). It’s always been a dream of my parents to adopt (me and bro are bio-kids) and they had come to the decision that they want to adopt an older kid. They got matched with ‘Jess’ who is 13. Due to the current situation, she is not living with us, but we’ve met before and she’s spent a weekend with us in January. Jess, despite sometimes being sweet and kind, is very high maintenance and has a lot of anxiety and anger problems. She can go from 0-1000 really quick. During her stay, she got triggered by something when we were in public (she and I went to a clothes shop and my parents were in a cafe nearby - some guy accidentally grabbed her by her shoulder as he thought she was his daughter, and he apologised immediately) and started screaming. I was the only person there, and I tried to calm her down but she ran off.She was found (shaken, but safe) an hour later. I then got grounded as I had failed in being responsible for my ‘sister.’ I said I didn’t have a sister. My parents were angry about this and said that how dare I be rude about her, don’t I know how much she’s been through. She’s had other outbursts, but none so huge in public. She can be cold and untrusting and was very clingy to my parents. I do admire her, and think she’s very brave - but I don’t want to live with her.My parents call Jess often. I often say hi, and try to be civil and supportive. But it seems like the only thing my parents can talk about is Jess, and how brave she is, and she isn’t even here yet.We live in a 3 bedroom house, and my parents promised to move to a bigger one later this year. Recently, my parents broke the news to me that Jess will move into my room, and I can pick whether I want to share a room with bro, or Jess. I don’t want to share with either. My brother is messy, loud and is your average 9yo boy and Jess has night terrors and screams the house down, and it’s enough having to open my house to her, but I value my privacy a lot and don’t want her in my room, which is like my special place. I was crushed. I asked if we were still moving, and my parents were like, ‘We like this place and have no solid plan.’ I freaked out and was like, ‘You guys are forgetting you have another daughter and are too excited about the shiny new one to remember that the one you have has feelings and boundaries, and if you’re changing everything I’ve ever known, at least I deserve to be listened to. If this is how life’s going to be, I don’t want to have a sister.’Good to note: my room is big enough to have a wall put in, and my parents considered it a few years back. I would be happy with that. They refuse, even though we can easily afford it, because it is ‘too much effort.’My parents are offended that I’m ‘not being welcoming’ towards my ‘sister’, and I’m offended that the life I knew is going to be turned upside down, and I’m not going to have the thing I value most, my privacy. AITA?Update: this blew up... enough to reach jess. she called me and we had a good heart to heart. she was unaware of the situation, and felt really uncomfortable about it. we had a family meeting via skype to explain to my parents why this was a bad idea, and showed them some of the comments in this thread. they apologised and they said they would try to improve their behaviour. we asked to put up a wall, and they agreed. my father is currently watching a video on how to do it lol.jess also says hi to everyone - and thanks you for looking out for her."
337,Not the A-hole,AITA For telling a stranger to delete a picture of me and my seizure alert dog that he took of me on the bus even after he told me why?,23639,e015on,2940,"Heya. So this happened a few days ago, and I'm still pretty worried about whether I'm an asshole or not. I take the bus to and from work and it's quite a long commute. Background:  I have epilepsy. I have a seizure alert dog, and he comes with me on the bus. Because hes trained to do all kinds of support tasks, hes a large breed dog (sheepdog/poodle cross). Ive had a lot of seizures on the bus, so I have a hard time mentally dealing with the commute every day. To accommodate his size and to make me comfortable, I sit in the disability seating section if it's available so he can lay beneath/between my legs and out of the way. Now onto the story: I'm on the bus ride home, and I found a seat in the disability section. I was about 2 stops from my home, and  I was starting to have a few auras, so my dog turned around and was facing me/alerting me. The next thing I know, I see a flash. I look up, and a man sitting near me was holding up his phone and taking a picture of me. I was in a bit of a rough state, so I asked him to delete it. I was probably firmer than I usually would be, but my dog was alerting me and I had about 10-15 mins to get home. The man was stuttering and saying things like ""I just wanted a picture he was being so cute and I saw his ID badge (he has one attached to his vest that says ""seizure alert dog"")."" I asked him again to delete the pic and then he goes ""my daughter has epilepsy and it would be important to her to see a working seizure alert dog"" I told him there were plenty of resources online and made him show me that he deleted it. I was then at my stop and ran home.I felt bad, because I do epilepsy activism work so I felt for him but I was really uncomfortable with someone taking a picture of me while my seizure alert dog in the disability section just felt wrong. Should I have just let him keep the picture? AITA?Edit to clear up some things: -I dont care about legality, just the asshole nature of the situation-I'm a female :) -I live in Canada-While I dont have exclusive photosensitive epilepsy, flashing lights make my auras worse -If he had asked me, I would have gotten out of the way and let him take a picture of my dog. Hes super cute so I get it.Edit: I didnt know about the dog tax! Attached: [The headshot my work took for our HR Directory! ]("
338,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling people my missing cousin is staying with me right away?,23631,kazgfw,1487,"It is the middle of the night, and my phone won't stop ringing because of my family.To try and keep this short, my cousin ""Jake"" got outed about 4 or five days before his 18th birthday in the summer. His parents, my aunt and uncle, made arrangements for him to be sent to one of those awful camps that claim they could ""cure"" him. A kid in his community was forced to go and came back and was clearly not well, so Jake didn't want to go.Jake ran away from home, and jumped from one family house to another. His folks didn't file a missing person report because they didn't want to look bad to their neighbors. They just told them that he went to that camp willingly.He dissapeared in the middle of october, and turned up in my city a week later. After making sure he was safe to bring home, my wife and I allowed him to stay. He didn't want me to tell the rest of the family for a while, because those people at the camp keep showing up to take him.I made sure to talk to a lawyer, who assured Jake that they cannot take him. Three days ago, he told his parents he was here. A few hours later, those damn camp people showed up, but they were unable to take him.My family has been blowing up my phone for the last two days angry that I didn't tell someone sooner. Well, jake didn't feel safe yet, and still doesn't. I wanted to make sure he was ready.Still, even those that want to protect Jake is upset with me for hiding him.AITA for not telling anyone that he is here until he was ready?EDIT:  Wow, thank you all for the awards. I don't deserve them but thanks. Since I am drinking coffee and slowly going through the comments I thought I should say a few things.First off, while I figured I wasn't the AH for hiding him from my more narrow minded family, it was those that really wanted to help jake that made me feel guilty. They were all scared out of their minds and wanted the peace to know he was ok. I felt bad for not telling them. Though i am sure they wouldn't had turned him in, I felt bad because we were working on keeping him safe.Also,  we got a lawyer who got the police on the look out for those camp people in case they try anything. Jake is not going out alone until we are sure he is safe.Third, we are looking on how to get his paper work, like his birth certificate, here because no way he trusts his parents to just hand them over. My granny in law is talking to some people that could help.Fourth, Jake says hello and thank you.Oh and we're Catholic, not Christian. We're our own special type of jacka$$es.EDIT Once again: ok you're right about the Catholic/Christian thing. I was raised to split hairs, I apologize."
339,Not the A-hole,AITA for informing my uncle that he is responsible for his daughter's gender and not his wife?,23558,ig9upr,1784,"My uncle Jesse, aunt Lola and cousin Poppy(F, 6) visited us today. It had been Poppy's birthday last week and we hadn't been able to visit them to wish her, so we gave her the gifts we had bought for her. My parents bought her a doll house and some clothes and I bought her a remote controlled car and some toy binoculars. Aunt Lola and Poppy was very happy and accepted the gifts but my uncle looked annoyed when he saw what I'd bought for Poppy.I asked him if something was wrong and he asked me why I bought ""boys toys"" for his daughter when she was a girl. I asked him if he is saying only boys can play with remote controlled cars and binoculars and he said yes. He asked me why I didn't buy her a doll or a kitchen set or something more feminine. I stared at him incredulously and told him that anyone can play with these and toys aren't gendered, but he kept insisting they are and started to get angry.My mom told me to let it go but I found it ridiculous that he was already restricting his daughter's choices at such a young age and forcing her to be ""feminine"".Uncle Jesse then said ""If I had had a son, then these gifts would be acceptable. Unfortunately it is Lola's fault that she gave me a daughter, so don't give Poppy such masculine gifts.""I knew my uncle wasn't very educated but this was the dumbest thing I had ever heard someone say. I informed him that it was his sperm that decided Poppy would be a girl, it isn't Lola's fault at all. That Lola has XX chromosomes and he had XY chromosomes and I basically went on a rant explaining how everything works. He was extremely angry after this and told me to stop lying and to shut up. He picked up Poppy and told Lola that they're leaving, they took only the gifts my parents brought and asked my parents to ""teach this idiot manners"". My dad yelled at him for saying this and my mom didn't say much to them but told me I had stepped out of line. That I should have just stayed silent and ignored what he had said. She said I was extremely rude. AITA?"
340,Not the A-hole,AITA for yelling at my dad(51M) and calling him a monster for what he gave my sister(30F) as a Christmas ''gift''?,23536,kn9wvu,790,"My(28F) sister Amanda(30F) never met her bio-mom. My dad(51M) raised her alone until she was barely 1, my dad and my mom got married in 1992.Amanda knew that my mom wasn't her bio-mother, she started pressuring my dad for information on her mom when she was around 17, my dad always gave her vague answers and refused to talk about her bio mom, which put a strain on their relationship.Enters our uncle (49M) and revealed the ''family secret'', apparently, Amy's mom wanted an abortion (she was 19), but my dad and his parents were able to ''bribe'' her, they offered her money if she followed up with the pregnancy, and she accepted, my grandparents sold one of their houses and gave her half of that money to Amy's mom when the pregnancy was viable, and the other half she received when she waived her parental rights over Amy to let my mom adopt her when she was 4.My uncle wasn't supposed to tell her that, my grandparents were furious. Amy stopped her crusade to met her bio-mom and her relationship with my dad went back to normal, Amy never mentioned her bio-mom again, dad got her into therapy after that. A month ago, Amy found out that she was pregnant, the pregnancy was an accident, she switched birth controls. The problem being, Amy is about to start her surgical residency and her hours are insane, it is basically impossible to raise a baby while working in that rhythm, so she wanted an abortion, the problem is that Mark(35M) her fiancé (6 years together) wanted her to keep the baby, it caused a big fight.In a dick move to convince Amy to keep the baby, Mark told dad about this (until that point no one in our family knew about this), dad talked with her and they got into an enormous fight. Amy went got the abortion 10 days ago, Mark ended up breaking up with her, she is obviously really sad.My dad was acting like a jerk, he was pretending that Amy didn't exist, he didn't want to talk or see her.So on Christmas day, we were exchanging gifts, when everyone had already finished giving each other gifts dad got up and gave Amy her ''present'', he gave her an envelope in front of everyone and told her to open it.It was 3 pictures with something written on the back, a name, an address, and a phone number.Dad told her that he was tired of ''babying'' her, that this is a photo of her bio-mom and her two sons, that was her bio-mom address, and that he contacted her bio-mom and she is willing to speak with Amy, he gave her Amy's number, dad thinks that they will have ''a great relationship since they are so similar''.Amy broke down crying, I ended up in a fight with dad, called him a monster for doing that to her, he just said he ''was just tired'' and left, we ended up leaving and she spent the rest of Christmas crying on my shoulder, she is a mess since that.My younger brothers called me a grinch for making a scene and ruining Christmas, my mom was silent during the whole thing.My parents have been giving me the cold shoulder since Christmas.AITA here?edit: Amy is short for Amanda."
341,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my girlfriend that her phobia is ridiculous and she needs treatment?,23532,ea4hnu,2898,"My (20) girlfriend (21) has a very severe phobia of cold things. We live in England, so this is an issue for like, half of the year. She refuses to touch anything that might be cold, including the floor with her feet in winter, door handles, walls, cold water, absolutely anything. She has to run a full bath of very hot water before she has a shower to 'make sure the floor isn't cold'. She also will not eat cold food or drink cold drinks at any time of year. This means that she drinks almost entirely tea and coffee (with the occasional hot juice), meaning she's always anxious because of the sheer volume of caffiene she takes in.It's winter in the UK right now, so her phobia is in full swing. It's getting ridiculous to see her refusing to do literally anything because she might have to touch something cold. On Thursday, she left her slipper boots on the other side of the bedroom (she had socks on, but took them off when she got in bed) so she called in sick to work and stayed in bed all day. When I got back from work, (I work 8-4, she woke up at about 11, so she waited about 5 and a half hours) she was desperate for the toilet, really hungry, and distressed. Why didn't she call someone to help her? Her phone was on the window ledge so it would be cold. I told her that her this situation is ""ridiculous"", and she needs to ""get some therapy"" because she can't live like this, and it's really impractical for her to literally not go to work because of this. It's super annoying and I don't know how she intends to get through life like this.She was extremely upset and told me that I'm an asshole for not taking her seriously, she said she realises this is ridiculous but she can't help it. I told her she could help it if she tried to get some help. Just to add, she is okay going outside in the cold air, but as usual won't touch anything cold."
342,Not the A-hole,AITA For losing it after my wife wanted my daughter to stop using the bathroom in the house?,23511,lprhvx,3092,"My wife and I have been together for 3yr. I have a daughter from my previous marriage. She's 14. I also have a stepson who tends to be rude at times but civil enough around adults. He's 16. He and his step sister get along well. No arguing, no yelling even better than most siblings I know which is great and it's quite a relief to see them loving and respecting each other.We have two bathrooms in the house. My daughter only uses the smaller one. Since it's always available unlike the main bathroom that me, my stepson and wife often use.I've recently received some money and decided to renovate the small bathroom that my daughter uses since she complained about things needing to be fixed. I started the renovation 2 days ago. While my daughter uses the main bathroom as an alternative. There were no issues until my wife pulled me aside saying my daughter's been leaving period products inside the bathroom and it wasn't right cause my stepson would see them. I asked my wife for more clarification and turns out my daughter gets rid of her used pads by putting them in the trashcan inside the bathroom. I told my wife there was nothing wrong with that so what's the problem. She gave me a look. Called me an ignorant then dropped it.This morning she looked upset and told me my stepson went inside the bathroom after my daughter got out and probably saw her used pads in the bathroom. I asked if she meant the trashcan and it was confirmed. She then proceeded to tell me to ask my daughter to stop using the main bathroom even though the small one is still in the process of being renovated. I absolutely lost my shit and told her she was making a ridiculously unreasonable demand. Told her it's my daughter's house too. Where is she supposed to go if she can't use both bathrooms?. We started arguing back and forth until she said she'd talk to her but I told her to stop it. She just kept giving me the cold shoulder for hours now even though my stepson said nothing about this ""issue"" as she claims it to be.My wife said she was trying to be a parent but I treat her as an outsider to my daughter. That's not true. I might've been harsh on her but in my opinion she wasn't trying to parent she was being unreasonable. I might be wrong I just don't see her point.AMITA Here!?My wife is an incredibly private person but that doesn't mean she can get others to follow.To answer your question: The trashcan we have has a lid. It's a step on trashcan that doesn't require hands.My stepson isn't even aware of what his mom's talking about. He can barely look around he always has his phone glued to his face and he doesn't pay attention to anything."
343,Not the A-hole,AITA For Telling My Wife That If She Quits Her Job I Expect Her To Cover All The Housework?,23468,cyj5v1,3780,"My wife wants to quit her job. She wants to be a SAHM to spend more time on with 4 year old daughter and stop leaving her at daycare centres.In order for her to do that, I would have to sign for a higher paying job schedule, about 2 hours more per day and occasionally half day on Saturdays. I told her that I if she quits her job then I expect her to cover all the housework. I may not be splitting the chores with her, since having longer working hours is rather tiring. I will will help out on weekends but during weekdays I rather rest. My wife then told me she that is not a housekeeper and I am being lazy and discriminative against women. I don't really mean that, as I think it is fair that if she stops contributing to our household income she can handle all the housework. I will also become the sole breadwinner and work extra hard to support the family. AITA?Edit: I admit that I did not really used a nice tone while talking to my wife because I was was having conflicted thoughts on either supporting her choice or trying to talk her out of it. Our household income isn't that high to begin with and it will be difficult to be the only provider. Ofcourse, I also think that my wife has every right to want to spend more time with our daughter and it would be good for both of them."
344,Not the A-hole,AITA for only going out to eat with my uncle after the rest of my family disagreed with my restaurant choice?,23437,gyip6p,1262,"I (F21) am currently living with my uncle and his family while I attend university. In my family it's tradition for everyone to invite out their family for their birthday. The person celebrating their birthday pays.My birthday was yesterday and luckily restaurants here have already opened up. About a week in advance I chose a Moroccan couscous restaurant and made a reservation. I briefly mentioned it to the rest of the family at dinner but I don't think most of them were listening.Two days ago I reminded everybody where we were going. Everybody except for my uncle started to complain about the choice. My extremely picky cousin (17) apparently hates Moroccan food, even though I don't think he's ever tried it. My aunt is uncomfortable with going to ""that kind"" of restaurant (?). My other cousin (26) is a vegan and didn't think he would be able to eat a lot of things, and his girlfriend didn't want to eat there because she's on a raw food diet. My other cousin is apparently on a diet  and didn't want to go somewhere where she could get a salad.It didn't really bother me that they disagreed with my choice, but what bothered me was that they hadn't even tried the food or looked at the menu, but already didn't want to go. They asked me to change my choice and instead that we could go to a nearby restaurant that they go to every week and that I don't really like. I refused and said they just didn't have to come.Only my uncle came with me when we went to the restaurant yesterday, which I'm happy about because I know the rest of the family would have done nothing but complain. It was delicious and it was nice eating with an actually adventurous person for once. Now the rest of the family is angry at us because birthday meals usually include the whole family, and they think it's inconsiderate of us to have eaten without them. I think it's their fault for not even wanting to try it. AITA?Edit: Thank you everyone for your judgements. I saw a lot of people confused about paying when it's your birthday. Where I'm from it's the custom, not just in my family but everywhere. I think it's a nice custom. That way no guest worries about not being able to pay, and it's nice to be able to pay for family and friends to have a nice meal."
345,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my brother in law that paternity tests aren't automatic,23416,gdr20t,1868,"UPDATE: wow this got a lot of comments!!!So I have done a LOT of snooping. And it is way more soap opera than I thought.1) apparently since child 1 didn't look like him at all, she made up the paternity test scheme to trick him into marrying her. But, THEY ACTUALLY DID PATERNITY TEST THAT KID and the real test said her ex was the dad. But he refused so she lied about the result, and my bfs bro never asked to see the papers2) it gets worse. She's been secretly collecting child support from bio dad, and using it as get secret slush fund, while being a stay at home mom and making husband pay her way3) she cheated on him A LOT and figured that she could lie again if the kids weren't his, and secretly rake in the child support. So, each baby she had tested, but the next two were his.4) he decided to stay bc the kids - but he called the baby daddy of Kid 1 and explained the whole situation.5) Baby Daddy of kid 1 is in negotiations for visitation or to cease child support.ORIGINAL POSTA while back I started buying a house w my boyfriend. We decided to let his brother and his brother's wife and kids live with us.The wife and I each got pregnant within a few months of each other, and so the house was totally wrapped up in baby preparations.Well, when it's her turn to give birth, he gets back with her and he's all aglow and happy saying how much the new baby looks like him, and he says ""I couldn't deny her [the baby] if I tried even without the paternity test!""I thought this was a weird thing to say. As far as I knew, their relationship was good, so I didn't see why they would do a test.The first time he said it I let it go, but he said it a few times to a few family friends and it really started to bother me. Especially that everyone just took it in stride.Finally, when everyone was gone various places, I asked what he meant by that. I was like ""you keep talking about a paternity test what's that about"" and he said it was ""the one they do when a baby gets born, at the hospital"" and I asked what he meant and he got frustrated and said ""you know the one they always do at the hospital when a baby gets born, like you guys when yours was born, so they can put it on the birth certificate.""The confused me even more. I explained to him we didn't have one done, that we filled out the birth certificate paperwork beforehand, and all they did was ask my bf if he was the dad and he said yeah so they marked it down.He got really quiet, and it kinda clicked for me that something was up, so I said ""maybe it's because I have different insurance"" because that's all I could think of.Well he shut himself in his room, and when his wife got back they had a huge fight, and it turns out she's been cheating on him for like six years. Everyone is upset with me for telling him, because it ruined their happiness about their new baby. Am I the asshole?"
346,Not the A-hole,AITA For not switching places with my friend and ruining her life,23411,l5gpw6,2116,"This happened a couple weeks ago but I'm still getting shit about it.A friend of mine Daya (fake name) asked me if I wanted to come with her on some errands and see her new car. I said yes because I had some things to get done and my car was being checked over. (We're in the same bubble and stayed masked the whole time)Well while we were out Daya ended up hitting another car while turning left. We were both shaken but mostly fine yet but when I started to call the police Daya started freaking out even more. She started begging me not to call the cops and to just go talk to the other driver. I didn't feel comfortable not calling them so I went ahead and did. Then Daya started begging me to get in the driver's seat, saying I had to get in the driver's seat, I had to claim I was the one driving. Turns out Daya doesn't have a license. She needed/wanted a car but didn't feel like getting her license so her mom bought the car for her.I didn't feel comfortable lying to the police so I continued to refuse and just got out of the car and waited on the sidewalk for them to get there. Well Daya got arrested for driving without a license, insurance, or registration for her car and just told me today she has been found at fault for the accident.Now Daya, her mom, and half of our friends are saying I'm an asshole for not just switching places. She is now facing multiple fines, possible jail time, and being kicked out of our MA program because of all this. I tried to explain that I didn't feel comfortable lying to the police but she just keeps calling me a ""privileged bitch"" and wishing horrible things would happen to me.So am I the asshole for not switching places with her?Edit: Several people have said I should include this and I'm sorry I didn't in the original post. This was much more serious than a fender bender. This was my response to someone else: ""She took the entire front of his car off or at least it looked like it. We were at an intersection and she was in a left turn lane with a yellow light and didn't look before she went. The other gentleman was coming the opposite way going straight. Both cars are totaled."" The gentleman was not unconscious as I originally thought but he did hit his head on the steering wheel and he had to be taken to the hospital. He did eventually get out of his car with help and that's when I believe I should have talked to him. Daya and I were mostly alright with just some bumps and bruises.Edit 2: Someone suggested I add this because of people saying I am the asshole for calling the police but for major accident such as this one where I live you are required by law to call the police and file a report."
347,Not the A-hole,AITA for emasculating my BF?,23403,glilwo,2197,"I (30F) met this guy (28M) in January and he became my BF in February. Comes March, the world goes down the drain and we decided to move in together for the time of the pandemic. Everything is great.In the morning, we have this routine where he browses Reddit and gives me the highlights. A few weeks ago, he shows me a post where this guy is challenged to an arm wrestling competition by his GF. The guy didn't seem to have any sort of training/work out whereas his GF did.I commented he might have a surprise. My BF started educating me on biology and how men are stronger than women. I told him there were way too many factors to take into consideration to make such a broad comment. I have been doing weightlifting for 2 years and my BF has never seen a gym in his life, so I used us as an example. That was a BIG mistake.He got really defensive and condescending, and made comments like ""That's cute."" I just let it go.Fast forward to yesterday. He's playing some game with his friend (online) and I can clearly hear him talk about me. Well curiosity killed the cat. At first it's all pretty and my ego is bursting, but then he says I'm delusional because I think I'm stronger than him. Pause. ""Seriously? I know I'm weak but not weaker than a girl."" So later, I decide to call him on his BS. I asked him if he wanted to come workout with me the next day (this morning) so he can show me how strong he is. He accepted and I was happy because I had been dying to bring him and initiate him to something I'm passionate about. So, this morning, we went to my friend's (27M) garage (my region allows groups of 10 or less and we wipe everything). I told him we're gonna do deadlifts. It's my favorite exercise and I was already planning to test my personal best so it was perfect.My friend was there cause he corrects my form and it's been our Sunday ritual since Covid-19. We started light and slowly worked our way up, doing the same number of reps as the other. Comes 185, his form starts to crumble so we made him go lighter. But 185 really isn't that much for me so I kept stacking the plates. He looked very supportive and impressed the whole time. I ended up beating my personal best at 265. I was ecstatic and so were they.When we got in the car, he was very silent. I assumed he was just tired. We got home and that's when he exploded and asked me if I was proud of myself. Apparently, I humiliated him in front of my friend. I apologized. I didnt realize he was feeling that way. He got angry and said it really changed the way he saw me, like I'm less of a woman now. He stormed to the basement. I started collecting my things, but now I'm wondering if I should have been reading between the lines and stopped at 190 or something. Or just dropped it and never suggested we workout together? I knew very well I was stronger than him but I just had to prove it to him. AITA?Update: I still didnt get a word of him but since some of you asked, I will make sure to update you when he does. Thank you for the overwhelming response. That was a bit of a rollercoaster day but it made it easier to know I'm not completely in the wrong."
348,Not the A-hole,AITA for correcting every single sentence spoken by my boyfriend’s aunt in front of everyone?,23365,dv4je8,1989,"I know the title looks pretty bad but hear me out! I’m a native French speaker from Canada, but I have a very pronounced “Acadian/Chiac” accent. For those who don’t know, it’s pretty much a mix of French and English with some local dialect thrown in there. Pretty common in the maritimes, where I still live. I’m perfectly bilingual in both languages.I started dating my boyfriend, who only speaks English, about 4 years ago and spend a lot of time with his family, they’ve all been really great, except for one of his aunts. She says she was a French teacher in anglophone schools for over 40 years up until a year ago and even studied in France, and she INSISTS on only talking to me in French. I agreed at first since I didn’t want to be rude to his family but it’s getting super weird. I don’t understand how she was able to teach kids English or how she comes up with most of her sentence, like I have to guess 90% of whatever she says and hope I’m right because it makes absolutely no sense. (Example: she said “a la citrouille la tarte va bien dans ma bouche” which roughly translates to “to the pumpkin a pie goes well in my mouth” when she meant “this pumpkin pie tastes delicious”) She constantly criticizes my “accent”.  and tries to correct my pronunciation of certain words, and tells me I need to “pick a language” when I accidentally say something in chiac (speaking proper “français standard” is actually getting harder for me since I’ve been only studying/working in English). So last night during dinner she started going on about how Acadians were uneducated and made no effort to properly learn a language, which is total BS, and obviously weirdly directed at me. For the rest of the night I stopped guessing what she was trying to say to me in french, acting like I didn’t understand anything, and started correcting her as well - which was pretty much every single sentence she said. I wasn’t trying to be rude or aggressive about it but after a while she gave up on the French and ignored me for the rest of the night.  Turns out she was super pissed and told everyone I was trying to embarrass her in front of everyone. Looking back I think I might’ve taken it too far by not stopping after 2-3 sentences and I feel bad. My boyfriend said I was being bitchy while his mom said she probably deserved it. AITA here?EDIT: Forgot to mention that I told her a few years ago that it’s hard for me to fully speak proper French as I spoke chiac all my life, tried to explain Acadian culture (she wasn’t having it, surprise) and she stopped for a while but is now doing it again."
349,Not the A-hole,AITA: For uninviting my sister to my wedding for what she told my fiancèe?,23353,kspqdi,2296,"My M27 fiancèe F25 has an obvious permanent burnscar from an accident that caused her mother (her only parent) to pass away from injury. My fiancèe had a long recovery it's been 7 years. The scar is on her collarbone. it goes down her chest but isn't showing. Unless she's wearing scoop/square tops. She often wears hoodies/jackets to cover up. She puts this cream I don't know what ladies call it but it's supposed to tone skin color or something? I'm not sure but my fiancèe calls it foundation that is one degree brighter than her skin color. I absolutely adore her she's pretty, smart, ambitious and the list goes on. What happened was unfortunate and I'm glad she's at peace with herself and more confident.My family love her. How can they not. She's a member of the family. My mom makes sure she takes part in every family function and things like shopping and decorating other things. However. My sister made comments about my fiancèe's scar several times. I've called her out on her behavior several times to get her to stop because she was hurting me before my fiancèe with her backhanded and insensitivecomments. I told my fiancèe she had everyright to cut my sister out and not deal with her bullshit but she has been forgiving and respectful of my entire family.Our wedding is in February. My fiancèe went shopping for the wedding dress. This is where the issue started:My fiancèe showed the wedding dress to my sister. I didn't see it but I was told it was a spaghetti strap dress. My fiancèe likes this stuff. Anyways my sister saw it and went nuts she started criticising her choice and said that she should've gotten a high nick or a jewel wedding dress to cover up the scar. She argued with my fiancèe about it. I went to my family's house and I confronted her. I yelled at her after she told me my fiancee needed to return the dress and get a ""proper"" one so that guests won't focus on her burnscar and use it as the topic of conversation and gossip. I told her that she's not invited to our wedding. She isn't welcome to my wedding with this entitled attitude of hers and her insensitivity and disrespect. We argued for half an hour then I left.In exactly an hour. My mom and dad called and berated me saying my sister was crying after I uninvited her and that I had no right to univinte her. She's my sister and was just trying to help out and give an advice and avoid any ""unnecessary"" drama at the wedding. My mom said my fiancèe can keep the dress but suggested to wear a pridel shawl as a neutral solution. I stopped responding to my mom's calls and texts after that. Family members were upset my sister was uninvited and wanted me to invite her again because this will make family look bad in front of outsiders and guests."
350,Not the A-hole,AITA for evicting a tenant because they got pregnant?,23355,ikg117,2749,"Yes, I know the title sounds awful, but please do hear me out before making a judgement. I will accept whatever judgement I’m given.I (30m) purchased a 3 bedroom condo in Toronto, Canada 5 years ago when I was in my second year of medical residency. Soon after the purchase, I rented one of the rooms to my roommate (f29) to offset the costs of the mortgage. I live in one room, she lives in the second, and the third is my study/office. She has been a great roommate from the beginning. We aren’t necessarily friends (as in we don’t do things together for fun), but we get along exceptionally well.The entire roommate/tenant relationship has gone swimmingly up until recently. A couple of weeks ago, my roommate broke the news to me that she is pregnant. The father was a fling of hers, who does not want anything to do with the child. My roommate has decided she wants to keep the child anyways, and raise it on her own. To me that seems like a huge challenge, and I admire her for it.The issue is, while I don’t necessarily dislike children, I have no desire to live with a baby. While the condo is a fair size, I will most definitely be woken up by the babies crying at night. My condo is also where I like to come home to and relax, like a haven after a long work day, and the idea of coming home to a baby honestly seems absolutely chaotic. Especially since this isn’t my own child (ie one that my girlfriend and I decided to have/was mentally prepared for).As difficult as it was for me to do this, I told my her essentially what I’ve written here, and that it would be best if she finds somewhere else to live. I am not rushing her out or anything like that, I have given her 6 month’s notice, since any later than that will come too close to the birth. She was honestly quite taken aback by this, and thought that I was being cruel. Her primary concern is that rent has gone up substantially in this city since she signed on with me (I haven’t increased her rent since she moved in, so she’s essentially paying 2015 rent). She works as a waitress, and will likely need to find a lesser apartment to keep within the same budget. A couple of other considerations are that she was out of work while restaurants were closed, but I did waive her rent for that period. All of the furniture is also mine (aside from her bedroom), so she would need to figure something out on that front as well, aside from all of the child expenses. I understand her position, and I feel horrible about the situation, but I honestly can’t do it. AITA for this?Edit: Thank you to everyone who has commented. There have been two great suggestions on how I can make this situation better, which I have taken to heart. I haven't been able to give life much thought lately, as work has been quite busy. Firstly, I have a friend in real estate, and I'm going to see if they can help her try to find some affordable listings. Secondly - as I don't plan to take on another tenant after her, and can afford to do this anyway - I have decided I'm going to waive her rent for the remainder of the tenancy. This will hopefully give her a bit of a boost to get on her feet.Edit 2: I'm just checking on this for the first time today. My god, I was not expecting anywhere near this many replies. Thank you to everyone who has commented. I am about to head into surgery, but I will do my best to get back to as many people as I can later today.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Edit 3/update:  I am honestly overwhelmed by the amount of attention this has gotten. Thank you everyone that commented, regardless of your opinion. I was planning to reply to as many posts as possible, but honestly seeing as there are over 2000 comments, I think I will have to just address some common questions here. I also have an update on the situation, and I wish everyone that's commented so far could receive notification to read it.So firstly: To anyone asking about the legality of the matter, I consulted an attorney to be 1000% sure, and this is perfectly legal. Since I live in the unit, the eviction laws are much more lenient.Secondly: To anyone that said I should allow her to live with me anyway, I challenge you to consider what the alternative would be. If this doesn't happen now, then when? Her baby will become a toddler, and a toddler eventually becomes a school age child. Will it really be any better to do this later on? Or do you suggest that I let her raise the child here until they are 18?**Finally, the update:** When I came home from work today, I told her that I wanted to discuss the overall situation. Before I even began, she actually apologized to me for how she spoke to me, and for expecting that I would be okay for her to raise her child here. I told her that her apology is totally unnecessary, as her reaction was completely understandable considering the uncertainty of her future. I then told her that what I told all of you that I would waive her rent for the remainder of her stay to help her get on her feet. She pushed back on this at first, but after I urged her to think of her child, she graciously accepted. Aside from this, I also told her about my friend who could help her out with finding some affordable listings in the area. I thought I might be overstepping there, but she was actually extremely thankful and said she would take me up on there.Finally, I want to thank u/tuttipeachyfrutti for probably the best piece of advice that I've read (I'm sure there are many more people that I should be thanking, but I honestly don't think I'll be able to read everything here). This was that I could help her obtain a more reliable work position at my hospital, nothing fancy as she doesn't have any schooling, but it will be much more secure than waitressing (and once you're in, there's always ways to work your way up). There would also be benefits/maternity leave that I don't think restaurants usually offer. This was probably my biggest risk of overstepping, but when I mentioned the idea to her she was actually over the moon (tears were shed...). I do agree that I acted in self interest here, so I think it's the least I can do to make sure this soon to be mother and her child have some sense of security in their lives. Thank you again to everyone.**\*\*\*This isn't an edit, but more of a request. Does anyone here know if it's possible to change your title to include something like ""updated"". I really want everyone that commented to know that they all made a huge impact on a new mothers life. I can't thank you enough, very glad that I made this post.** "
351,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I report the nurse practitioner at urgent care to HR for basically slut shaming me?,23297,cemg2f,1226,"I've \[F21\] recently encountered a new sexual partner. We used a condom, but after words I felt a little uneasy as to this was the first time I have ever hooked up with someone I just met. My previous sexual partners have all been someone I have developed deep connections with in some kind of way. While condoms greatly reduce the chance of contracting a STI, it cannot provide ABSOLUTE protection. A few days ago, I noticed my discharge changed to a white substance that's different from my normal discharge and the first thing that came to my head was an STD. I have never had one before and I have no idea the symptoms, but an STD was all I could think about. I went to an urgent care because I wanted to see if there was maybe a simpler answer to this problem  (yeast infection or UTI) and if not, I wanted to send my urine off for an STD screening.  My doctor asked me a series of questions (when did you become sexually active, when was your last sexual partner, how many sexual partners, etc.) , all of which I was up front and honest about so she could better treat me. It came time for her to make a diagnosis and tell me the best course of action. She says based on my symptoms, I am showing hallmark signs of a yeast infection, but she will send my urine off for a culture and STD screen along with a swob from my vagina so she can tell what type of yeast is growing down there. As I'm about to get my keys and stand up to walk out, she says ""Dear, will you sit down for just another moment."" I sat back down and looked up at her, curious as to what she wanted to talk about. ""With all of that being said, you're 21 years old, you really need to guard and protect your character,"". I looked at her like ""what the fuck"" and she continued ""well you know, guys get to have sex all they want and nothing bad comes out of it for them but you know us as women we can't be doing that as much because we have to protect our character,"". At this point, I was pretty fucking angry. You could tell by my silence and the way my lips were pressed together. I thought that maybe it couldn't get any worse, then she proceeded to say ""you're going to want to have kids one day, and the way you're living your life now could really hurt you and your chances of having a kid with a good man,"".I was open and honest with this woman in hopes that it would help her better treat me and in turn I get slut shamed for it? I posted this in a forum about sexual education and I was getting advice to report her to HR. I don’t want to go after anybody’s job, but I don’t want other women to have to go through this same thing just for having sex. Will I be the asshole if I report her to HR or should I leave it alone?Edit: For everybody asking, I was literally in too much shock to say anything to her at the moment. I just kind of stared at her because I immediately felt embarrassed and regretted the information I shared with her so openly. So after a couple of seconds she said “I appreciate your openness and honesty tho” (like that mattered after anything she just said 😩) and opened the door for me to leave so I just said “thanks” and left. I was too embarrassed and in too much shock to say anything in the moment. Trust me, I wish I would have but I wasn’t even thinking about going off on her. I was just embarrassed. Also, she was a nurse practitioner. I know a couple of times I referred to her as a doctor, but her official title was NP. And for everyone slut shaming me even further: sorry ur insecure that I’m having more fun than u 😘UPDATEBefore I start off with the update, I want to address some of the negative comments in the original post. 1) I am not heartless, and in the original post I even directly said I did not want to go for her job. That was never my intention and I even explicitly said that. 2) for ever man calling me a slut: you’re obviously insecure in the idea that women can have sex for pleasure, just as you can. I also explained how this was my first time ever hooking up with somebody I just met, so “closing my legs” or “quit being easy” doesn’t fucking apply. In Game if Thrones, every single “whore” had one thing in common and that’s that they enjoyed sex. So if enjoying sex and using it for pleasure makes me a whore, then sign me the fuck up! 3) For teenage girls/young girls sexually active: if you come across this post, just know that it is very unprofessional for health care providers to pass judgment on your sexual life. What you decide to do with your body is really nobody’s business despite what other people are saying on this thread. Now to the update: I called the urgent care and asked to speak with either a patient advocate or NP supervisor. They didn’t have a patient advocate and the doctor overseeing the NPs was out, so they let me talk to the manager of the clinic. First and foremost, I explained to the manager that I in no means wanted any disciplinary action taken. I did not want her to lose her job, but maybe be given a talk or PIP to improve her service and not use personal beliefs or judgment when taking care of patients. I explained to her everything that happened and before I could even say who the NP was, she knew EXACTLY who I was talking about...which confirmed that she’s most likely been this way towards other patients previously. I then explained how I confided in her and that I came into the office for medical advice and not personal judgment and her using my openness to pass judgment has made me weary about being open with doctors in the future. I explained that her words didn’t hurt me, just my future interactions with health care providers AND future interactions with her other women patients. The lady was very nice, and once my complaint was heard she said she’d “call the doctor (her supervisor)” right away and to expect a call from him on my cell. She also said she was placing a note and that the NP wouldn’t be back in the office until next Monday. With all of that being said, thank you to everyone for your advice! You’ve truly been so helpful. And for the people calling me a slut for this, I hope to God this same thing doesn’t happen to your daughter, your mother, your sister, your aunt etc."
352,Not the A-hole,"AITA for refusing to be in my father's wedding even tho I ""cheated too""?",23293,ihjphi,1287,"A story as old as time. My (f27) father (50) cheated on my mother for 5 years with a younger woman(currently 32) and he left my mother when mistress got pregnant. It tore our family apart.I resent my father because my mother actually loved him and she is still dealing with this. Even 1 year after he left her.I stayed on okay terms with him because I was the one to pick up and drop off my younger brother at his place.Last week when I picked up my brother my father had big news. He proposed to his girlfriend and wanted me as his best (wo)man. It made me kinda mad ngl. But I kept calm... And told him no. He said that what happened between him and mom was none of our business and that I should respect his new relationship. I said I respect it but that doesn't mean I condone it. Obviously I would never hound him randomly about it but I don't approve of it and I don't like her. She knew the whole time my mom and we existed .Well my dad was having none of it and told me to get off my high horse because I had cheated too and I had no right.And I.... Guess?When I was 17 I was with this boy for 3 months. I went to a party got shit faced and made out with a classmate for a total of 10 minutes. I felt so bad that I called my boyfriend crying and we talked it out. We broke up. I told my dad and In 10 years I never did something like that again. I have been with my partner for 5 years.I told him he could not equate it at all. He called me a hypocrite. And that he was glad to know who I am.Driving home I felt like I was a bit harsh. He is still my father and he is not a bad father. I just don't want to be in his wedding. I would still go. But AITA,?"
353,Not the A-hole,AITA for 'going off' on a mother in the toy store,23237,l8ej2y,1339,"I'm (28M) my brothers care taker (21M mental age 7-8), our parents decided at 18 to tell us to screw off, so when my brother (let's call him Bill) turned 18 I grabbed him and enrolled him to get his GED since he didn't finish highschool, and take care of him. His chores are too clean his room,  help with laundry and set the table for supper. I get paid by the state and you better believe I make sure his needs are met. He's my little bud. At the end of the month for each day he does his chores he gets a sticker, at the end of the month that sticker gets counted as 5$ and he uses the money for whatever he wants.  Like toys, special snacks etc. He loves this. He's been so good lately with chores I took him out for burgers and fries and took him to the toy store. My brother is big.  Not fat, just tall and actually big boned (he's healthy weight and overall health), he gets excited and stims by flapping his hands, you do you little dude. At the toystore he announced he wants Barbie's,  cool,  no judgement,  and we go look at barbies. He's stimming and rambling about what he wanted and meanwhile a lady and little girl come in the aisle. Not even two minutes pass and the lady tells us to go to another aisle, she wants to look at the dolls and his weird hand movements are freaking her out.  I tell her to wait her turn. Not even another minute passes and she tells my brother to knock it off and go look at something else. Now I'm pissed. I tell my brother to get what he wants and looked at her and told her, her daughter could use a better role model, I'd hate for her to turn into such a grouchy hag. Took my brother out to pay for his barbies all while ignoring her telling me how much of an asshole I am for saying that in front of her daughter. AITA?"
354,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my mom she’s a whore?,23223,c6xdyj,1098,"Throwaway. Long time lurker, first time posting. I am the oldest daughter of 4 children. I’m currently 25, 2nd oldest is 23, 3rd is 20, and youngest is 18. When I was 8 years old, my mom had an affair with a family friend. I, being the oldest has remembered most of it and my younger siblings only remember growing up with our parents co parenting. This has put a strain on my mothers and I’s relationship- she cheated on my father who was battling cancer. She didn’t even try to keep it a secret from the kids, I remember during family/friend gatherings when everyone would be inside and I’d see my mom and the family friend kissing or doing things in the pool. As a kid I didn’t understand, but as I got older I realized what she was doing in front of us and I feel sick. People ended up catching on to their affair years later, and my mom left my dad and started a new relationship with this “family friend”. They split up shortly after that because he cheated on my mother. I’ve confronted her about this after my dad passed and we all went to see a family therapist. This was roughly 3 years ago. My mom has since remarried to an incredible man, but recently she was out and bumped in to this man from her past. They exchanged emails and she confided in me that they have been sending emails back and forth and are planning to meet up to chat and catch up. I read the messages and it’s very apparent that the guy still has feelings, while my mom is trying to make it seem like she’s just catching up with an old Co worker. But I know my mother, and I know she is still slightly infatuated with this man, and flattered that he still wants her. I mean it’s been years, why else would you want to catch up?My new step dad knows about her past, and while he doesn’t agree with it, it’s been years, he wasn’t in her life yet.She asked me what I thought about her meeting up with him, and said something along the lines of needing closure. She asked for my honest opinion about the matter and I told her “To be honest mom, you dealing with this guy in the past ruined yours and daddy’s marriage and you guys had 4 kids. Idk why you think it wouldn’t ruin this one, but why don’t you stop being a whore and stop thinking with your pussy, and delete this guys damn email?”She cried, said she couldn’t believe I just called her a whore and left my house. We haven’t spoken for a few days.Today, I got a call from my siblings saying I hurt my moms feelings and whatever happened betweens her and daddy’s marriage was between them. I disagree, I had to witness my mom cheating on my father, I watched him die in bed while she was off to god knows where with this man. She asked for my opinion and my opinion is that she’s selfish and a whore who left my dad to die on his own and she wants to rekindle with this man and possibly cheat on my new step dad? Sorry I’m not sorry for feeling some type of way about it."
355,Not the A-hole,AITA for moving out and taking EVERYTHING,23186,ihaau8,1234,"THROW AWAY for obvious reasons. UPDATE - in comments :)  and cat tax is  I (30f) lived with a longtime friend (30m). We lived together for 6 years and known each other for 20 years (close families)  He was very accepting that I came with a cat, I paid for everything and legally owned her. He adored her though and would spend hours cuddling her.  I owned everything, all the furniture and the white goods because I had lived out of home before but he had not.He got a GF at the 3.5 year mark and she practically moved in immediately. I still paid half the rent though. She was always very rude to me and clearly didn't want me alone with my friend.  There was only one lounge, attached to the kitchen, so he and I would previously watch TV together or just be in the same room while another cooked, worked etc. When she moved in that 'had to stop' because I was interfering with their couple time. Her attitude towards me got worse over time and my friend started treating me badly. They would leave sex toys all over the place, watch movies late and loud when my  bedroom was right there, glare at me if I cooked during their couple time even though they hogged the TV between 4-9pm.I got a bf and started spending a lot of time with him.  After this things got worse.  My friend began locking my cat in small cages and putting her the shower. He also began talking differently to me and leave the kitchen in a absolute mess (mould) to make it difficult for me to cook. I found used condoms in the lounge.  It then got to the stage where we wouldn't talk but all the tormenting was still going on.I decided to leave and started looking for somewhere else.  The lease was up in 4 months but we had not discussed what we wanted to do. I found out through his sister (and a close friend of mine) that they had been saving up this whole time to move out and would be moving in a few weeks'. This was news to me. I couldn't afford the rent by myself.I found a place before they did, spoke to the estate agent and advised them of the situation - turns out he had not been paying his full share of the rent and she was not listed as living there. The agent did not hold me accountable for any of it.  I paid 4 weeks' leave before I left. I didn't tell them when I was leaving and on a day when they were not home my friends helped me pack up and leave.  The house was cleaned spotless.  I also took all of my furniture, whitegoods and kitchenware - so basically everything but his room! I took my cat.After I left I received hundreds of missed calls and messages from them abusing me for not notifying them and taking everything and MY cat. Most of his family also messaged me telling me what an AH I am. My parents knew what I was doing, supported me but have also called me an AH because our families are still not exactly on speaking terms."
356,Not the A-hole,AITA For kicking my friend out of my house after what she did?,23165,lag3tq,1909,"My M36 wife passed away 2 years ago. I have a 11 year old son named Sean. I'm doing okay with money. I have a stable income and support system. I have a friend named Kate we've been together since we were kids. She's like a sister to me although she tends to boss me around. She's introduced me to her female friends hoping that I'll settle down again. I told her I have other priorities and I'm required to focus on Sean and his health (he's diabetes). Kate thinks there's something wrong with me but Not everyone's circumstances the same. I started noticing a pattern in her behavior after she introduced me to a friend of hers. She'd tell me to leave Sean at home when we hang out and meet her friends. She'd tell me to take down any pictures that have my son and wife in it because ladies will ""assume"" that I'm a single dad or still married and that'd limit my chances in dating. I told her to knock it off. And she said that she was looking out for my ""social"" life saying I'm ruining it and exhausting myself. I stopped talking to her for days. Then I decided to let it go.She's been insisting on bringing her friend to visit me with other friends. I agreed to have them as guests. Kate suggested I take Sean to stay with a relative since it'll be adult dinner but I refused. He was comfortable in his home and didn't wanna go. Kate was at my place before her friends arrived. I checked on Sean and told him to tell me if he needed anything before he went to sleep.At 12:30 while I was sitting and just starting to chat with Kate's friend while Kate kept blinking at me with a smirk on her face. I got a text message from Sean telling me he wanted to use the bathroom but the door handle was stuck and he couldn't open the door. I went upstairs to check. Kate followed me. I found that the door was actually locked. I was confused I asked Sean and he said he didn't lock it. I started looking for the key that's when Kate quietly handed it to me saying she took it. I was stunned. I opened the door for Sean then I asked her why she locked the door she said that lied to her friend about me not having kids and didn't want her to see Sean. She said it was no big deal since he was sleeping but I was furious. I started yelling at her as she kept shushing me. Everyone started leaving after I yelled at Kate and cussed her out for doing this.She blew up after her friend left and said I was an idiot cause most people don't mention kids until after months into dating. And that I didn't deserve her help to move on when she thought I was a decent ""sane"" person. I called her stupid and told her to get out of my house. She told me to wallow in my misery and left. Then her friends kept blaming me for making a scene and treating Kate like that especially since she cooked dinner and helped a lot."
357,Not the A-hole,AITA for lying to my boyfriend about when an event starts?,23134,cxf4fa,4567,"So this didn't happen recently, but it was brought up last night and my boyfriend seemed to get really mad about it, so I figured I would bring it to the group to see if I'm the asshole or not.My boyfriend has terrible time management skills and is late for everything.  I absolutely hate it because I am the kind of person that believes if you're not 10 minutes early, you're late.For an example, we were invited to a family lunch a few years ago.  Everyone was meeting at a restaurant at 11:00am.  We live 10 minutes from said restaurant and my boyfriend waited until 10:55 before getting in the shower or attempting getting ready.  We were an hour late meeting the family, who was already well into the meal when we arrived.A few months went by and another family gathering invite was sent out, with a 'start time' of 1:00pm.  Knowing that he is terrible at getting ready and leaving on time, I told my boyfriend that the event started at Noon, not 1:00.  And just as I figured at just before noon, my boyfriend started to get ready.  We show up at 1:00, him thinking we're now an hour late, only to find out that everyone else is just getting there too.So last night we got to discussing things and it got brought up how  I had lied about what time the event started.  I know it's a shitty thing to lie and he pointed out, if I can lie about something like that, whose to say what else I'd be lying about.  I told him he was right to feel like that, but reminded him that I don't have locks on my phone and he knows the passwords/pin numbers to all my accounts so he's more than welcome to check and see if I'm 'hiding something'.  I explained that I only did it because he has terrible time management skills and can't seem to be anywhere on time.  In my opinion, being repeatedly late to things is rude and it's a terrible skill to be teaching his children.He doesn't have any kind of problems with his family, so there is no reason that he would want to limit his time with them and it's not like these gatherings are boring/unfun events (the one I lied about the start time was actually a family paintball game, which we love to play).I've learned my lesson and don't plan on doing it again in the future, but I just have to know if I'm the asshole for lying to try and get him to be on time for something that is important to me.Edit:  So I posted this before I left for work when there was only a handful of comments and wasnt able to check it all day.  I certainly didn't expect it to get this much attention, let alone 20,000 upvotes.Though I haven't yet gotten a chance to read through or reply to any messages or comments yet, I'd like to thank everyone for their judgements.  Whether you think I'm an asshole or not, you took time out of your life to try to explain your point of view of the situation and I appreciate that."
358,Not the A-hole,AITA For my reaction when my 30yo fiancè exchanged his gift with my 16yo brother?.,23110,kkkb53,2640,"I F26 been with my fiancè for 3 years. We both work and we both share rent and other expenses. But My fiancè is currently looking for a new job. He lost his old job 3 months ago. My family lives 30min away and although it's been difficult this year I decided to get my brother (who has a chronic condition and struggled a lot lately and was in the hospital for a few days for anemia) the one thing he's been wanting for some time. I got him an Xbox that cost me 300$. He was so happy and I'm glad I was able to cheer him up during those times.My fiancè received a few gifts from his family. But he wasn't happy with any of them. I got him a perfume and he liked it.We were visiting my family and we had dinner with them. My fiancè looked at the Xbox I got for my brother and didn't stop talking about it. My parents noticed, I told him to stop complaining about what he got/didn't get this year. That made them uncomfortable especially since they've been dealing with my brother's health issues and needed to relax.We got home and my fiancè took something from the closet and left for about an hour.I was asleep when he came back. In the morning I was surprised to find my brother's Xbox in the closet. I woke him and asked him about it. Turned out He dropped me off drove back to my family's house and exchanged the gift his aunt gave him (a 14$ fancy pen) with my brother's xbox. He said that my brother was happy to exchange gifts. I was so mad I told him this wasn't for him and he basically took something that is not his. Not to mention a pen for an Xbox, that's ridiculous.He told me that maybe I shouldn't have spent 300 while trying to pay for rent. I told him as long as I can pay rent that's not a problem. And that he needs to find a job if he thinks my money isn't enough. I called my mom and I found out that they didn't actually exchange gifts. My fiancè pressured my brother into giving him his Xbox. I was livid and so mad I told him to take the Xbox back to my brother but he said it was between him and my brother but I insisted. He refused so I ended up taking it myself. My fiancè argued when I took it and said that I was pressuring him and treating him poorly and have no respect for his feelings. I told him he was wrong to make my brother give him his gift and causing him stress and ruining his joy. I apologized to my brother and my parents and I felt awful because of how my fiancè behaved. My fiancè isn't talking to me saying that I have no consideration for his feelings and not understanding how he feels not having money to buy himself the things he likes.I'm surprised because he has never done anything like this before. I get that he's struggling with finding a job but this is not an excuse."
359,Not the A-hole,AITA For pressing charges when my stepson took something my daughter inherited from her mother?,23112,kyt7wd,2334,"I [M47] been with my wife for 2 years. She has a 21 year old son. I have a 14 year old daughter from my previous marriage. My late wife passed away in 2014. She left a few things for our daughter. Including a gold jewelry set. Her mom was devastated she didn't get to gift the set to our daughter on her wedding day. I keep it in my closet since it's expensive and my daughter is too young to have it. I'll hopefully gift it to her on her wedding.Last week. We were sitting in the kitchen when my stepson was hesitant to ask me something. We're in good terms but have our fair share of arguments. He said his fiancèe was taking something from his mother's and my closet. saw the jewellery set and liked it very much. He asked if he could borrow it so his fiancèe can wear it at her cousin's wedding. I found this unacceptable I told him his fiancèe had no business being in the bedroom and that the jewellery isn't mine. It's for my daughter. He asked me if my daughter will agree to let him borrow it if he talked to her. I told him not to even talk about it again. He got all pissed and said things I do not remember.Saturday night. When he and his fiancèe were at the wedding. I discovered that the jewellery set was gone. I told my wife and we looked all over the house. I called my stepson to tell him about calling the police because I really thought someone stole the set. He said there was no need. That he borrowed it and will return it after they get back from the wedding. I yelled at him and told him to come back with it right then. I kept calling him til 12am when he told me to stop calling and that he'd bring it in the morning.I couldn't sleep that night I felt terrible. In the morning he showed up at 10am. He didn't bring it and started stalling saying: ""he forgot""- ""he'd bring it the next day"". At this point it was clear he gifted it to his fiancèe and was stalling. I got so mad I told him I will be pressing charges if he doesn't return the set today. We got into an argumentMy wife said his fiancee was the one who wanted the jewelry set. But he was the one who took it and it's not even mine it's my daughter's which made it worse. Because I'm responsible for whatever happens to it.His grandparents berated me after I told them this and got mad and defended him when I said that I will be pressing charges. he stole and needed to be responsible for his actions He didn't respond to my final calls so now I've given him one last chance and it's overI pressed charges today. They're saying calling the police was extreme and cruel. They're all convincing me to back down.Aita for pressing charges?He was replying to me sarcastically when I said I'd get the authorities involved and he didn't take me seriously. His mom said she'd try to talk to him but I had enough of him stalling hoping I'll just let it go. So he can make his fiancèe happy.I feel like an irresponsible idiot. I can't even look at my daughter without feeling frustrated and infuriated. I'm hurt but what's worse is that this is my daughter's property that I couldn't take care of.My wife allows them into the room although I told her not to several times they're not kids and there should be some boundaries.I just needed to mention that We're in Europe."
360,Not the A-hole,AITA for charging my sister £2500 for one of my paintings after her kid ruined it?,23108,eqxekx,3490,"Backstory, I’m 26 and a fairly successful artist. My sister, “Lucy” (24) and her child “Ethan” (9) were at my house during a late New Years celebration. I had a sign posted on my art studio saying “DO NOT ENTER” and specifically made it clear to all guests that nobody was to enter that room. I’d also like to note that all my guests were asked to leave their kids at home as this was for ADULTS but ‘Lucy’ couldn’t do that because she couldn’t find a sitter. Anyway. Note : I also set up my boyfriends PS4 for him to play on so he wouldn’t be bored. It’s 10pm, and I hear a loud crash from my studio, I run up and see paint all over my recently work that so far had taken 15 hours to do. Ethan was sat there laughing, rubbing paint into my work, it’s now unsalvageable and I have to restart the work, as it was a specific request from a client. Which also puts me behind for the rest of my work now!! I immediately asked Ethan and Lucy to leave, and the next day I sent her a bill for the work. £2500 (which is LOWER than I would’ve gotten for the work anyway). She’s absolutely screaming about it, the whole family is divided. My mom hates me, my dad completely agrees with me. Surprise, my dad is an artist, my mum is more ‘smart smart’.  My sisters husband agrees with me.  I will admittedly say, I don’t enjoy kids. Or their company. But I’ve always been a great auntie, presents at Christmas, gifts from vacation, everything he’s wanted. Am I the asshole for charging my sister £2500?"
361,Not the A-hole,AITA for intentionally posting the wrong test answers on a cheating website?,23060,dyi6m8,3089,"BACKSTORY:I failed my first 400-level  physical chemistry test 2 months ago. I barely passed my second one last month.I noticed I scored significantly below class average on both and the curve wasn’t quite what I expected it to be. (That’s ok, labs + hw keep my grade at a high B)Side Note: The class is about 60 people. Unbeknownst to me, It fills up quickly every semester because people think the professor is ‘easy’. I didn’t know this. The class just fit my schedule and I certainly didn’t think it was ‘easy’ after those 2 exams.Here’s the catch: Our professor is old and I noticed during exams that many people were suspiciously using their phones. I heard rumors that someone had posted the test questions to a relatively well-known site (it will remain unnamed)  and some students had used that to score A’s and B’s. (We can’t really use the site for homework help because of our homework structure, but a lot of us use it for test review & test prep, which is extremely helpful). Our tests are LONG -we get 2 and a half hours for each test- which gives these students plenty of time to post the questions and receive the answers online. EXAM DAY:I was EXTREMELY irritated when I heard this. This rage really fueled me and I over-prepared for Test 3. I studied like crazy  for it because I felt like these cheating students were robbing me of points from a regular curve. I was able to finish the test in about 45 mins of the given time. I didn’t know everything, but I felt pretty great about what I turned in.  I was the second student done with the exam and felt pretty good as I wrapped it up. Once I finished and began walking out, I looked around and saw a ton of people cheating. I was so angry and so distraught, that I used my free time after the test to go on the site and see if my peers had posted the test questions. Of course they had. I had memorized all of the questions (there was only 6) and found 4 of the questions had been posted online.  I answered ALL of them incorrectly, though I made the process look somewhat legitimate. I realized that if I answered those questions first, the real site tutors wouldn’t answer them in the given time (I was right). PRESENT DAY:I scored a high B, and the curve put my grade at an A. I had the fourth-highest score on the exam.Most students failed, even though I found this test to be much easier and much more manageable than the previous two. I looked at the tests of my peers as we compared results. We always compare the partial-credit points to make sure our grades are fair. I saw that a LOT of them (I’d estimate about 13-15 students based on what I saw ) used the ”fake” methods I had used on those incorrect answers.  More students failed this test than the second test, and it was pretty evident that I’d screwed some of the cheating students. I honestly can’t say I feel bad about what I did. I worked hard, and their lazy efforts directly impacted my GPA and my future. EDIT: A common argument I see here is “See you studied and did better! Just keep doing that!” I studied like a maniac. I didn’t go out, didn’t attend meetings, just had total focus on this one test. It’s a completely unsustainable level of study and was only possible because I didn’t have much going on in my other classes."
362,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to pay bills for a house i house-sitted a month ago,23053,kpj367,1960,"I don’t really think i’m the asshole in this situation but the family member, her boyfriend and her mum sure do. Although the fact that the family member recently lost her job due to the pandemic does make me feel like i’m being an AH. A little less than a month ago, i decided to house sit for a family member and her boyfriend for a week while they were going to see their parents. I knew i wasn’t getting paid for taking care of the home/feeding their pets but was okay with it because i live with my parents and a week away sounded like a dream come true.House-sitting went fine and i’d pretty much forgotten about it until today. The family member sent me a paypal request with no explanation. She requested $184 and i immediately called and her and asked why she was doing this. She stated that it was my share of the bills for when i stayed. I was in shock, i told her i took a week off of work to care for her house free of charge, she said that i still had to pay utilities. Keep in mind, i was never once made aware of this otherwise i would of told them to get lost when they asked me in the first place. I told her to go fuck herself and hung up, ever since she’s been messaging me saying she’s gonna call the police and tell everyone on facebook about what a horrible piece of shit i am. I haven’t responded to any of these messages and don’t plan too. Am i the asshole?UPDATE: She ended up posting about me on facebook and the overwhelming majority of people on there defended me, some of them calling her stupid and laugh reacting. Safe to say she deleted the post and blocked me after that and i haven’t heard anything since. According to my cousin, she’s posting quotes about being betrayed and how family ain’t shit."
363,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my sister to stop using the word family on me like it's supposed to mean something?,23049,jxe1wx,1073,"As stated in a prior post I was kicked out at 15 for being gay. From 15 to 35 I had no contact with my family.  Over the years they have somehow managed to work their way back into my life.  Only in a small capacity.My sister who is younger than me called earlier and asked what me and my husband were doing for Thanksgiving.  I told her that it was just us and that we were just going to have a nice dinner and probably watch TV for the night. And go to bed early. She told me that she was having dinner and that we need to show up.  I told her thank you but this was the first set of holidays in ten years that I didn't have to host and I was planning on staying home and just putting on a fresh pair of pajamas after a shower and not going anywhere. She then asked about Christmas and I told her the same thing.  She then asked when it would be a good time to get together.  I told her point blank that I wasn't all that interested given our history and that I was perfectly happy with how things were at this point.This was when she got pissed off and started to yell at me saying that I need to start acting more a part of the family and that I need to let go of the past.  She told me that we as ""Family"" need to try and bridge the gap and move forward in a positive way.I told her no we don't.  We hardly know each other.  We are very much strangers.  I also told her she needs to stop throwing the word family around like it is supposed to mean something to me.  When we started to talk again when I was 35 when our dad died her and my brother constantly berated me and told me that I need to just let them deal with everything that needed to be done.  I never disagreed with them. I told them them that they could handle it.  I was berated when our mother was sick for not visiting her in the hospital or when she was home.  I really don't have much of a relationship with my mom and she is a pretty good stranger as well so it didn't really matter. I threw everything back in her face.Before we hung up she reminded me that it wasn't my husbands blood that runs through my body.  And blood is thicker than water.  I told her no.  My husbands blood did not in fact run through my body. But his semen did and that was close enough. I thought my husband was going to wet his pants.So AITA for telling my sister to stop using the word family like it means something?Edit. Good Morning everyone.  I hope that you are all having a great day.  First I wanted to say Thank you for all the responses, awards and everything else in between.  This has been completely insane.  I never thought this would go so far. I have tried to read every single response but there are so many that it will take hours to get through them all.  I wanted to do this edit to fill in some blanks so to speak. When I was kicked out I was 15 and my sister was 8.  So she did not have anything to do with what happen.  But she had every opportunity to find me after a certain point.  When she was 16 and had her own car she could have come find me.  When she was 18 and on her own she could have come to find me.  She never did.  When our dad died it was a friend of mine who talked me into going so that I could maybe find some kind of peace with what happen all those years ago.  She and another friend went with.  My husband (boyfriend at the the time) had to work and couldn't get the time off.  Initially I was greeted with surprise and thank you for coming.  But then with hostility from my sister and brother.  If they for a minute thought I was out to get something from them or our dads estate they were wrong.  I wanted nothing. And to this day I still don't.  My siblings have always told me what my place in the family is.  Which is basically I'm window dressing. I have been told that I have no business in knowing anything about the family finances, family affairs or anything. I think that they are afraid that I could potentially take something that they want or are supposed to get.   A couple of weeks ago my mom asked me to read over some financial paperwork that she didn't understand. Reluctantly I agreed but once my sister found out she screamed at me for putting my nose into areas that I don't belong. I told my mom not to ask me for anything again because I will not be involved.  I have been asked a few times why I do keep in contact with them.  The answer is because it's my way of keeping ahead of them.  I do not voluntarily make contact with them.  I have no reason to.  I keep my Facebook locked down to the point that I don't show my city, my job, my phone number nothing.  But I can see all of their stuff.  This works because they post a lot and if I see that they are having problems with whatever the case maybe then I can work to make sure that if they ask for something I can not answer or just ignore them all together.  Plus it does give an open avenue for communication  in the even of  a major emergency.  Plus maybe I still hold onto a hope that they will maybe at some time they will actually apologize.  But I don't see that ever being the case. I have been asked if my mom has ever apologized.  No she has not.  And she never will. She is from a generation where parents don't apologize to their kids.  Because that would mean they did something wrong. She is from a generation where kids were to be seen and not heard.I guess it comes down to this.  My family has formed this dynamic that I will never be apart of or want to be apart of.  And I'm okay with that.  I was not asked to come to Thanksgiving or Christmas.  I was told that I will be there. Why??? I don't know.  Then when I declined twice things got ugly. Thank you all for all your replies and support!!! "
364,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I record the audio of my neighbours having sex and play it back to them?,23032,cowczz,1856,"My neighbours are often super loud, blasting music at 2am, yelling, blaring the TV. I’ve gone round various times politely asking if they could be quieter. We have concrete walls and carpet, so for sound to get through they really have to be loud, which they are. They also periodically have loud sex, with the woman screeching. It’s actually turning me off sex. I find them insufferable.  As petty revenge, I’m considering recording them having sex and playing it back to them through the walls whenever they’re loud, instead of going round to politely request they stfu at 3am. I feel they know I’m mild-mannered, and they’re taking advantage - that since I’m not a tough guy or something (I’m a young woman), they don’t care. I’m in Australia, and I’m pretty sure that kind of recording is legal here.  WIBTA?"
365,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not letting my sister have ""custody"" of her bio kids, who I adopted?",23027,j6c8ey,1788,"When my sister, Annie, was 18, and I was 21, she got pregnant and had a daughter, Sophie. She developed what we believe was post partum depression, but was never diagnosed as she refused therapy. When Annie's school started up again our mother took on all childcare of Sophie. As mum took on more childcare, Annie seemed more like her old self (happy, outgoing, generally mentally healthy). Then within 6 months of Sophie's birth, Annie got pregnant again with another girl, Laura, and the cycle of PPD symptoms, mum taking over, and Annie's mood improving repeated.When Laura was 2 and Sophie was 3, Annie decided to move out of our parent's home, *alone*, and said she wanted our parents to adopt/raise her daughters. They said no. Annie said she couldn't take care of the girls as she had her own life and being a parent made her miserable. My husband and I already had 4 kids of our own, we'd bonded with the girls, and we had the resources for 2 more, so we offered to take them in, and Annie let us legally adopt them before moving about 8 hours away.It's been about 5 years, and the kids are doing well. It was a rough start, but we're now a stable, loving, healthy family unit. Sophie and Laura are 7 and 8, and Annie has recently lost her job and had to move back in with our parents.Annie has now asked for ""custody"" of Sophie and Laura. I'm writing ""custody"" like that because it wouldn't be custody in the legal sense, as she willingly surrendered all legal rights to the girls and can't get them back (we checked with a lawyer). However, Annie wants the girls to live with her. Initially she said she wanted them full time and to legally adopt them back from us, which we obviously refused, then she offered a ""compromise"" of alternate weeks, so 50/50 ""custody"". Again, we refused. Given her insistence, we don't even want her around Sophie and Laura, so we've not been going by my parent's house as we typically do.It's been a month of constant badgering, insisting we let Annie bond with ""her"" daughters, and allow her to at the very least take them for overnight visits, saying that Annie had PPD 5 years ago, and now she's ready to be a parent. I've responded that we are not babysitters, we are Sophie and Laura's parents, they're in a good place and this will be detrimental to all 6 kids, and Annie doesn't get to step in now when she never stepped up in the first place. The response from my parents and Annie is that I'm being unsympathetic to her PPD and I should let her at least have a chance, rather than deem her unfit without giving her a chance to prove herself, plus given that we already have 4 kids other than them, Sophie and Laura could probably do with a smaller household, and saying we're being unreasonable for not allowing Annie to bond with ""her"" kids."
366,Not the A-hole,AITA for not inviting family members to my wedding?,23024,g2zj2r,1464,"This goes back 3 years when my mom and her girlfriend got engaged. My mom put in so much time and energy into organizing this wedding and was so excited. She sent out invites to all our family members 4 months in advance, & almost everyone confirmed they would be going. Barely a week before the wedding, she received several messages from aunts and uncles who said they wont be going because they had “other commitments” despite confirming they’d be there months prior. One of my aunts (my grandma’s sister) confronted my mom and said many weren’t going because they still didn’t agree with the fact that she was marrying a woman, including herself because it went against her “Christian views”, meanwhile my hardcore Christian grandma was more than happy to walk my mom down the isle. This upset my mom but she tried not to let it ruin her wedding. I however, was furious. Only my grandma, my mom’s sister, a few cousins, and another aunt attended the wedding while my stepmom’s entire family came. What really pissed me off was that 2 wks later, my cousin who lives in a totally different state celebrated her sweet 16 and everyone who made excuses about not going to my moms wedding made the journey all the way over there and posted pictures all over Facebook. It really broke my mom’s heart and just felt like salt in the wound. I swore then that when I got married, everyone who did not show up to my mom’s wedding would not be invited to mine. Fast forward to now , me and my girlfriend of two years got married first week of March and I kept my word. The only ones we invited to our wedding was the family that did go to my mom’s, and one other aunt who did have a good reason for not being there at the time because she was recovering from surgery. We even invited my stepmom’s family too. Obviously my other family members found out and expressed their hurt over not being invited. I called them all out and said if they had a problem with my mom for being who she is, then they had a problem with me and I wouldn’t let toxic people be apart of a special day for me and my wife. My wife stood behind my decision, as did my mom.  That still doesn’t seem to stop them from thinking it was a dick move and are turning it into a whole family drama because they think it was unfair to “punish” them for simply believing in something different. AITA?EDIT: Wow thank you so much for all the love and support everyone! My wife is getting a kick out of these replies and I’ll respond to some when I have the chance. Also I know some of you were confused so I wanted to clarify that I am in fact a guy"
367,Not the A-hole,AITA For demanding my fiancé and his mom to pay for a new wedding address?,22994,j1kuds,3270,"Me 26F and my fiancé 28M been engaged for 4 months, we're planning on having our wedding on October 18th, My future mother in law kept annoying me and sending me suggestions for choosing the right wedding dress, and said that she knew better and tried to get me to approve of wedding dresses that she chose and when she couldn't enforce her decision she demanded that I take her with me to buy my wedding dress so she could have an opinion.Before I went shopping I called her to ask if she wanted to come but started making excuses about how busy she was with my sister in law, I went shopping with my mom and I was able to find a really nice dress although it cost me a little over what I saved up for, but it was worth it.I made some changes to it and it was perfect, it arrived to my apartment at the end of the week, I made sure it was stored in a safe place so it doesn't get ruined.Yesterday, I got back from my mom's house, and found that my fiancé wasn't home neither was the dress, I called him immediately knowing that he must've taken it to show it to his mom since she continuously asked to see it and refused to have me send her pictures of it on Facebook.I was so mad when it was confirmed that my fiancé took it to show it to his mom, he said he was gonna be home in 30 minutes after he went to the supermarket I waited for longer than I had to and then when he arrived I ran to get my dress that was buried underneath grocery bags, I took it to check on it and it's zipper was broken and the dress itself (fabric) was stretched out, I was like what the fuck happened to it, my mother in law must've tried it on, because it looked ruined, the straps were almost loose, I had to call my mother in law when my fiancé told me his mom and sister took turns to try it on, I was absolutely livid, she told me she did nothing wrong and that I was making a big deal out of it.She said she'd get a replacement for the broken zipper, but I told her to pay for a new dress since it was stretched out and no longer fitting, she refused and said that I probably wasn't happy with my dress choice and wanted to her to pay so I could get a new one, I yelled at her for trying it on and ruining it, that she and my fiancé were responsible for ruining my dress so they should pay for a new one, It's done, no longer fitting, the straps are in a horrible condition, my mom said she'd pay for fixing it but I just hate it now that someone else wore it before me.I'm mad at both of them and seriously considering postponing the wedding."
368,Not the A-hole,AITA? I found out my sister is pretending to be my daughter's mother,22978,k1i7ch,1514,"When my (27F) fiancé and I first announced my pregnancy to my family, my sister (34F) was a little jealous, I'm assuming it's because she was trying for a baby with her ex partner but they broke up because he was a cheat. I gave birth to my daughter seven months ago. Her name is Kaia. When I returned to work after 12 weeks of maternity leave, my sister offered to babysit Kaia once a week which has been incredibly helpful. Not too long ago, one of my close friends who also recently had a child approached me to tell me that my sister is in a mothers group on Facebook and she's posting photos of Kaia and she's calling my daughter HERS and she's also calling her by a different name. My friend sent me screenshots of my sister's posts and I was completely disturbed so I spoke to my fiancé and we both decided we had to take action immediately. I went over to my sister's and asked her directly about what she was posting on Facebook, she did not deny it and also had no explanation. Therefore I told her that she's banned from seeing my daughter. My sister flipped out and said that I can't take Kaia away from her and then called me a ""selfish b!tch"" and she started crying. I have NEVER seen my sister act this was before, it was alarming. I ask her if there's anything else I need to know because she may as well just spill everything, so she shows me a framed photo she has in her bedroom of her and my daughter and on the frame is written ""mother and daughter."" I'm not going to lie, I did call her crazy and then I left and haven't spoken to her since, although she continues to try and come over and calls me multiple times a day.My mind is an absolute mess. I don't know where we go from here. AITA for how I handled the situation?"
369,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for making my kid give a gift she really wants for her bday to the person she stole from?,22953,binqjd,2846,"My daughter turns 11 in ~6 weeks. She has been BEGGING for a Nintendo Switch. Due to poor grades & overall bad attitude, we decided not to get a Switch. Money isn’t the issue... it’s her behavior she acts very entitled & she’s lying left & right. I just don’t feel now is the right time for a Switch.The theft: On Easter, we (my husband, our kids, & myself) are at my husband’s aunt & uncle’s house. Aunt & Uncle have 2 adult children, one of whom is mentally delayed (we’ll call her Cousin) she functions @ about a 10 yr old level but is in her 40s. She lives in an assisted living apartment & has a job where she gets paid ~$5 a week, so she doesn’t get many upscale things unless they are a gift. Well, Cousin had an old game boy that she saved up to buy & was playing while we were there. She eventually set it down & moved on to playing a board game with us while the kids ran around playing.Well..... this is where it goes to hell in a handbag.My kid decided to be an epic turd & took the gameboy. She snuck it out of Aunt & Uncle’s by asking if she could go to our car to look for a book she had brought, & stashed it in the glove box. She proceeded to hide the fact that she had the gameboy for several days, even after being asked where she last saw it (her opening to come clean) when Aunt & Uncle called & asked if we had seen where Cousin might have left it.Due to Cousin’s challenges, she was utterly DISTRAUGHT over her missing gameboy. It’s one of the few forms of entertainment she has, & she worked hard to have it.I’m disappointed about the thievery, but I’m even more upset over my kid’s attitude about being caught. I only found out about it because her sisters ratted her out. Even then she absolutely refused to tell me the truth & tried to pin it on her sisters. It wasn’t until I sat there & thought about it that I knew she was lying to me. Once I told her I knew it had to be her because of XYZ did she finally confess. Her behavior only got worse from there. She refused to apologize when Uncle & Cousin came by to get the gameboy, & had the balls to act like SHE was the one being wronged. I feel like I need to drop the hammer on her and send the message home that stealing IS NOT OK. I think that purchasing the Switch (with my daughter’s help from money she would “earn” by doing extra chores) & having her give it to Cousin might be a good way to deliver that message while simultaneously giving Cousin a nice upgrade to make amends.I mentioned this to a friend & they said this would be a dick move because... BIRTHDAY... I don’t really think that matters, but the comment was enough to make me question myself. What do you think Reddit?Edit: Thank you all for the replies. I just wanted to let everyone know who is suggesting therapy that we have been taking advantage of that option. Also - I do intend on giving my kiddo the opportunity to earn a Switch down the line, just not in such close proximity to this incident. Not sure how or when, since I have a SO to consult, but the opportunity will be provided in some way.***Edit: I’ll add more context here because some people are making assumptions and saying I’m TA for being a lazy parent. Our therapist is of the opinion that my daughter largely has these issues because of the inconsistent co-parenting relationship her bio dad has with my husband and I. My husband and I are big on structure, boundaries, natural consequences, and following through. Her bio dad is the exact opposite of us. He and his family hardly ever tell her “no” to the things she wants, and give her a ridiculous amount of treats (toys, candy, etc.), and this is causing her to be confused, to struggle with our expectations, and express herself negatively. I assure you, we have been addressing these behaviors for quite some time."
370,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to support my niece's lifestyle?,22925,iao1c0,1549,"My sister and her husband were sent to prison at the start of this year, and sadly won't be released for a few years. That left me to look after their 15 year old daughter Amy. I was perfectly happy to do this, but as most of their wealth was seized for being ""ill gotten"", it's meant that I've been having to care for her out of my own pocket. Once again this doesn't bother me, but it's meant massive life changes for the kid. Firstly, they sent her to a private school. I can't afford anywhere near those fees, so I had to transfer her to a local school. She was upset at this at first, but she quickly made friends and is excelling academically so this isn't a huge problem. She's been off school for the last few months anyway due to the situation.A bigger problem is clothing. Like my sister Amy loves fashion and designer stuff. She's still got a lot of stuff that her parents got her, but she's always on the lookout for new clothes. Unfortunately, I can't afford anywhere near the sort of stuff she likes, and I also have two children of my own whose clothing I have to pay for. I have told my sister this, but she insists I should ""make allowances"" because her daughter is going through a tough time. Amy also really doesn't get along with my daughter Hannah, who is 11. She bullies her, calls her stupid and ugly, tells her none of her friends really like her etc. She has made her cry on many occasions and and often continues to taunt Hannah while she cries. Yesterday I caught Amy trying to buy a dress costing over a thousand with my card. I was fuming and had a long conversation with her. She cried, and sobbed that she just wanted one nice thing. My sister called from the prison, and Amy cried over the phone that she hates here and I treat her unfairly. I spoke to my sister afterwards and she begged me to go easy on her daughter because she's ""still adjusting"". I put food on this kid's plate. I buy her whatever clothes I can afford, even if they aren't to her taste. I take her to visit her parents as much as possible (they're held in different facilities) and I do all of that on top of working and looking after my own children. I told my sister that I was willing to look after her daughter for as long as she needs, but if anything like the card incident happens again, or if she continues to pick on my daughter, there will be serious consequences for her. My sister wanted to argue but they get limited time on the prison phone. I think what I'm doing is right. I get that the kid is going through a tough time, and I'm doing everything I can to be there for her. But I can't just tolerate bad behaviour or bullying, and I can't afford to pay for her expensive clothing. The fact that she's struggling to deal with what happened to her parents doesn't change that."
371,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to let a woman take for from my green house and pressing charges,22915,kra9ca,1925,"I (30M) live in a nice little neighborhood, everyone knows everybody, we all have our own space and many have flower gardens.  I have a green house in my backyard that is visible from the street and behind a four foot picket fence. We got a new neighbor, haven't had the chance to meet them until today.  I have a camera in my yard that notified me of movement near the green house so I went and checked and that's when I found a lady and young teen picking tomatoes and peppers in my green house.  I raised my voice and asked what on earth they were doing and the woman says it's fine she's friends with the owner. I asked if she wants to run that by me again cause in the owner and I don't know who the hell they are.  When she realized she was caught she tried to leave with a bag  full of vegetables,  I told her she isn't leaving with that food and she has two minutes to drop it and leave or I'm pressing charges. She starts crying that she's trying to feed her child and needs it and that she can't afford this on her record but I didn't feel like rewarding a theft  and took the food from her and called the cops. She's telling everyone im an asshole and a toxic  man and though most are telling her she's in the wrong, her friends on facebook are telling me I'm an asshole and should be ashamed. AITA?Edited for information: when she was offered the chance to leave without police involvement she screamed at me and broke a pot that had some chives growing. I don't have her on facebook. However my name is on my mail box and have since put my account to private. If she had asked first,  by all means I would have given her a couple peppers,  tomatoes even some squash,  but she didn't."
372,Not the A-hole,AITA For Telling My Sister She Was Dating My Bio-Father?,22900,l8v24r,1995,"So, my life's turned into a bloody soap opera recently and I could use some outside opinions here.I (24F) am the product of my mom having an affair. Fortunately my dad decided to forgive my mom and keep me, and I had a pretty good upbringing. But I don't really look a lot like the rest of my family (I'm the only redhead, among other things) and I did ask questions of a 'why am I the only one with -insert trait here-?' nature growing up. When I was 17 my mom took me out for ice cream and introduced me to my bio-father. She said that she felt I was old enough to know the truth, and explained about her affair, while also A) making me promise I wouldn't tell my older sister (27F in the present)  and B) hammering home along with my bio-father that he'd never be part of my life and didn't want me.It was a lot, I won't lie, but I learned to suck it up and move on with my life. Fast forward to the present. My big sis has always gravitated towards older men (we like to joke that it's the result of too many George Clooney movies growing up) and two months ago shared a picture of herself and her new boyfriend. Who, to my shock, turned out to be my bio-father. I debated what to do for a couple of days, then ultimately decided she needed the truth and told her. My sister did not take it well and dumped him, but she wasn't angry with me. Honestly by now she's kinda amused, says that since she banged my dad she's my mom and has extra power to boss me around now.My mom on the other hand, is *furious*. She says I divulged something that wasn't my secret to share, and that I had no business telling anyone. That since bio-father isn't related to my sister it didn't matter if he dated my sister and it wasn't like they were talking marriage anyway. It's been two month and she's still angry, still snide, calls me a traitor and finds excuses to make loud comments about how I can't be trusted with anything private or important so beware.At the time I thought I was doing the right thing, but I've never seen my mom this angry before, and she's sustained that anger for 2 solid months, so I'm starting to worry. Did I actually do something really shitty, am I the asshole?EDIT: Wow, this got a lot more comments than I expected. I can't answer everyone, but I do appreciate every comment and the support that I'm getting. Two months of having your mom furious with you takes quite a toll, so it's been really relieving seeing so many NTAs in the comments. Thank you all, I'm trying to read everyone even if I don't reply!"
373,Not the A-hole,AITA for cutting my hair after a friend's death despite a contract that dictates what I'm allowed to do - or not to do - with my hair?,22878,kscxoj,2630,"I've ""lost"" my job and have been ostracized by my family, so I figured I'd come to the court of public opinion.One of my best friends of over ten years lost her battle with the big C word on Christmas. Fuck cancer, y'all. I'm not handling it well, tbh. I feel like a really crazy person. I literally haven't stopped crying. Through all the tumultuous emotions, I decided that I wanted to cut my hair. I don't know why, but I felt like I wanted to get rid of a psychological weight and my hair was suffocating me. I 'model' and I've been doing it pretty much my whole life. My family is upper middle class due to my income. My parents 'work' as my mangers, even though I had actual, hired, experienced managers throughout the years. My dad works part time elsewhere, but I am the main breadwinner in the family. Part of my current contract was that I can't cut my hair without prior consent from managing parties or else my contract could be rendered void. It wasn't really an issue until now.For a week, I tried to get consent, but nobody wanted to give it. So, over the weekend, I locked myself in my bathroom and chopped off almost all of my hair. I didn't go as extreme as 2007 Brittany, but I was definitely channeling her energy. Now I look like Steve from Stranger Things. I don't feel a lot better, but it was kind of cathartic. I'm glad I did it. My life changed, and I physically reflect that now.Now I'm unemployed, though, cause I was released from my contract and as soon as I'm done with high school, my family wants me gone.I know that I jeopardized my family's financial security, and my parents are scrambling to figure out how to pay the bills because I may have been an immature asshole, but, I dunno, maybe it's grief, but I feel pretty apathetic about it. I wanted to grieve in my own way.Am I the asshole for that?UPDATE: 6.35PMSo I talked to a few folks today, and I was sent a copy of the email exchanges that ultimately ended my contract. My contract was set to expire in June, but I wasn't booking until May to give myself time to finish up my last semester in high school. Instead of terminating my contract or 'firing me', i was released from my contract in a really nice way. I won't copy/paste, but the gist isHere at Company we value the health and safety of all our employees and it seems that Brittany is going through a hard time. Let's release her from her responsibility so she can enjoy school, and should she decide to come back after high school or freshman year of college, she'll be welcomed back into the agency.They even sent a .pdf of therapists or counselors that I might wanna talk to. I talked to my old manager and she set me up in contact with a lawyer and already has access to copies of my documents, which she sent me in .pdf, too. I also contacted Jasmine's mom, who said that I can move in to finish hs if I'm kicked out in March. I'm not gunna say much, but what my parents were doing was definitely illegal unless I have trusts, which I doubt bc my parents both have nice new cars and stuff.I also emailed my school guidance counselor. I have a new email contact, and I'll be sent my financial records ASAP. So... yeah. Posting this morning, I honestly felt like an ungrateful, whiny teen who fucked over her family, but you guys made me realize that my life is *definitely* not normal or fair, and I thank you all for that, and for the immeasurably kind words you've all given me.I'll keep fighting!Edit: I'm an idiot and somehow blocked someone while scrolling  in my inbox."
374,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling someone she’s the common denominator in her failed friendships?,22866,gzkypd,1757,"I’ve been with my parter for a year now and have met most of his friends. He’s very close to his friend group from high school which I think is very sweet. His best friend is getting married next year, and my bf is one of his groomsmen so we’ve been spending more time with his friend group lately. I’m admittedly not super keen on one of his friends (S) but I’ve always just chalked it up to personality differences. She’s quite loud and dominates conversation a lot, but it’s not like I don’t like her, I just find her a bit much. We were in a zoom with bfs friends, shooting shit and the wedding came up. At one point we were talking about outfits etc and S said how much she hates shopping and was dreading going shopping. She made a weird comment about how she’s so not girly and ‘one of the guys’ which I found immature, she’s a grown woman after all, but I didn’t say anything. S asked if I knew what I was wearing and I said no, but I had planned to go shopping with a friend of mine who also had an event coming up. I was going to ask S if she’d like to come with us, but she interrupted saying ‘Oh, that’s so cute! I just don’t like stuff like that, I don’t hang out with other girls, I just prefer being with the guys.’ Which I found really patronising to be honest. It was clear I was annoyed, and the conversation kind of took a turn.Me: So you have never had a friendship with another woman before?S: No I have, I just find a lot of girls petty and catty, don’t you?Me: No I don’t. I’m friends with lots of women, we compliment each other, go shopping together and occasionally share pastries sometimes.S: Oh I could never, girls always talk behind my back!Me: You know, if every single relationship you’ve ever had with another woman has gone sour, there’s a common denominator there, and it’s not the fact that they’re other women, it’s probably you. A couple others laughed, and tried to move onto a different topic of conversation, but it was clear S was angry. She logged off early and later texted my boyfriend and said I was way out of line. He replied and told her he didn’t think so, and if she was one of the guys she should be used to a bit of gentle ribbing every now and then. I feel a bit bad because all though I felt hurt by her comments, she seems quite insecure to me, plus it’s not really my friendship group so I may have been a bit over bearing. AITA?"

I cut contact with her for a few months after she tried to get involved in my marriage. My husband and I been together for 3 years and he has always been telling me to be more gentle with my mom.I had a miscarriage a few days ago. It's devastating and I really thought it'll get easier but I'm still feeling excruciating pain and frustration. We were happy and excited but all that disappeared suddenly and it was hard for me to take because I thought everything was fine. I didn't tell anyone especially since I'm currently dealing with some health issues.I didn't tell anyone in the family. My husband promised not to tell until I'm ready. My mom kept asking me questions and brought up my pregnancy constantly and my answers were short. Because I didn't want her to know since she'd call everybody and let them know. She's always like this that's why I tend to keep things privateI decided to not visit for a couple of days hoping she'd stop asking questions. Then I found out on FB that my mom announced my miscarriage on her page and I didn't know about that I was shocked I freaked out when I started getting calls from family members and I have no idea how many people knew about it. I was so mad to the point of shaking. Everyone kept berating me for not telling them.I called my mom and I yelled at her. she defended herself saying that she was just looking for support and that I should've told her about it first time she asked what was wrong. I asked her who told her and she said she had a talk with my doctor but I shouldn't be mad because she's my mom and she had the right to know what's going on. I argued with her about getting involved in my personal life and disregarding my feelings and cutting me off guard like that.I went to the doctor and I lashed out at her for releasing my private medical information to my mom and causing me to deal with everyone asking why I was hiding my miscarriage from them even though I was just waiting for the right time. I told my doctor that I was going to file a complaint against her the same day since she didn't respect my privacy and decided to give my mom information about my medical records.My mom heard and started berating me saying it wasn't the doctor's fault and that she was a friend of hers she knew year's ago but I didn't know about it. She said that I went too far and acted like my family were strangers. She said that she's my mom and I didn't need to overreact like that. All I needed was time and space now I have to deal with all this stress and I'm a mess right now.* My brother texted me a few minutes ago and said he wants to come over and talk to me. He was the first to call me and berated me and said that I was being hostile towards everyone for no reason. I haven't replied to his text yet but I don't want to see anyone right now. I can't take one more word from them.
376,Not the A-hole,AITA for letting my toddler destroy 200$?,22840,ia7s4c,1043,"At my 1yo child's birthday some relative gave him 200$. (I) said I'll take it and (R)elative denied. I: don't worry, I spend it on him or put it in his saving account R: no, i want to give him money myself I: *surprised pikachu face* that's not the best idea, he will eat it or something R: but that's his money and i want him to have it. At this point I'm just tired of this fruitless conversation and said sure, go ahead. And then i watched my son grabbing this money, rotate it in his little hands and tear it to pieces in like 3 sec. Relative called me names because ""I knew it's gonna happen"" and i obviously knew so i couldn't denied. But really is it that shocking, he's 1 for fuck sake and I told her to not give him this money(On mobile and not native speaker, of course it wasn't 200$ but equivalent in my currency)"
377,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving the call when my brother announced that his gf is pregnant?,22766,jyk2ac,1808,"My brother and I do not get on.When we were younger he'd go out of his way to make my life a living hell. To my parent's credit they did tell him off for it when they caught him but they both worked long hours and didn't have the energy to deal with our arguments. This continued into adulthood. He was salty that he failed his college course the first time around.There was a bad argument in our family a while ago and, I shit you not, it all started because I refused the decorate my brothers living room. I wont go into too much detail but he wanted a pretty hefty discount, I said no and he threw a tantrum.You really need to meet my brother to understand just how bad he is. But hopefully this post will do it some justice. Instead of being a grown up and talking to me, he decided to hook up with my toxic ex girlfriend and the mother of my child. Due to the rules here I can't go into a lot of detail about what she was like but she was not a nice person. She never really bonded with our son when he was born and I was left to do everything by myself. She eventually walked out on us and refused to have any contact with our son. She'll post on Facebook now and then about her beautiful baby boy to get sympathy votes but that's about it.I have been a single dad for almost three years now and I absolutely adore my son but it hurts to think that one day he might question why his mum didn't want anything to do with him. How am I supposed to explain that to him?Anyway, it bothered me when my brother told me they'd hooked up together. It hurt even more when he started dating her. It had taken me so long to get over what she did to me and my child and now my own brother was bringing her back into my life.Yesterday we had a family video call (parents are high risk and we're not taking any chances) when my brother decided to announce that he and my ex were expecting.I just froze, I didn't know what to do or think. I could feel myself starting to cry a little bit and it got a bit harder to breathe. Eventually I decided to just congratulate them and then made up some lie about needing to put my son down for a nap and left.I received a bunch of messages from my brother and his gf telling me that I stole their thunder. After I left, my parents and some other family members started worrying if I was okay and not really focusing on their news. My uncle told me that I should've just ""been a man"" and stuck it out instead of making excuses to get out of it, after all it was expected that our kids would be raised around each other.I feel like maybe I shouldn't have left the call but at the same time it would've been worse if I'd stayed and had a full blown panic attack in front of everyone. Some of the family members are split and have argued that I won't be able to avoid my brother and his family forever but others believe I was in the right to leave that situation. I don't know what to thinkEDITI just wanted to say thank you first of all for all the support. I fell asleep last night and woke up to so many kind and supportive comments.  A lot of people have been asking how my parents feel about this. They aren't happy but they don't have the energy to deal with all the hassle my brother would cause. They actually cut him off for a little wile when he started dating my ex but he phoned them constantly and, again can't go into much detail, but he said he'd do something not so good. They keep him at arms length but I have told them not to cut contact because of me. If they want to cut contact on their own accord then that's fine but I do not want to be the reason that they have to deal with his tantrums.The rest of the family, for the most part, weren't happy about it but accepted it (or pretended to) when they started getting a bit more serious. My uncle )who told me to be a man) thought it was funny, that's just the kind of person he is.I think as hard as it might be, I am going to cut off contact with my brother and ex. As a lot of people pointed out, not for my sake but for the sake of my son. I don't want to put him through all that.Sorry I can't reply to all your comments but I've been trying to read them all. Thanks again Reddit."
378,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to split my inheritance with my siblings?,22750,halg61,1875,"I’ll try to summarize as much as possible. I (f19) have an estranged grandpa more or less. He’s my dad’s father, but my dad hardly had a relationship with him. I have two other siblings (one younger, (13) and one older (26). My grandma divorced my grandpa when my dad was only 10, so he lived with my grandma his whole life in a different state and didn’t see him. When he got older he saw him a little more and my grandpa started coming around a little bit more as well. He’d stay for a week at a time and then go home. He was an old, bitter man to be honest. He never got remarried and lived his whole life in his coastal town with the same friends he’d had his whole life. He wasn’t pleasant to be around and could hold grudges longer than anyone I’ve ever met. But regardless of this, he was filthy rich. He owned a successful business that he sold for $1m dollars. He retired after selling, but his house sits on an island as well as the biggest piece of land on the island. So it sold for well over $3m. I was never close with my grandpa, but I took after his sister who is an RN and he adores her. He always told me that he was proud to see me follow in her footsteps. He died a few months ago. Since then, my family has been torn apart. He left everything to me. He essentially liquidated all of his assets and it ended up being close to 8 million dollars. I was shocked. I didn’t and still don’t know what to do with the money, but I’m going to save it. My dad and stepmom as well as my siblings are hounding me to split the money with them. I just can’t do it. My dad is an alcoholic who never said anything nice about his dad. Despite him being bitter, my grandpa actually bought my dad a $300,000 house. My dad would 100% drink away any money given to him. As far as my siblings, my brother has full financial support from my grandma as he is the favorite and he’s very wasteful and ungrateful. He never talks to me and always is very mean to me when he does. My little sister is the only person I’ve actually considered. She’s very young and that’s really the only thing stopping me. Her mom is money oriented and would take the money from her. So I’m waiting until she turns 18 and i offered to pay for her college. But now my family is telling me I’m unfair and the money doesn’t belong to me and I’m not deserving of it. That I’m too young and I’ll waste it on cars and clothes. I don’t agree and now they’re all threatening to cut me off and never speak to me, or even sue me if I don’t give them all a chunk of the money. I don’t know what to do and I’m buckling under pressure here. I’ve already had 2 police officers out to my house because my dad is claiming I stole the money from him. Everything was through an attorney, I know I did nothing wrong legally.. but morally? Idk. So AITA?"
379,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not allowing my niece to use ""promised"" money from my grandma's estate to go to college? My family is derisively calling me ""Scott's Tots"" in order to get me to bend and give in, and it's sort of working.",22745,cqty1q,2515,"Edit: for all the people asking, Scott's Tots is an episode of the The Office, the plot is Michael made a promise to a group of grade schoolers that he'd pay for thier college. He assumed he'd be a multi millionaire in 10 years when it came time to pay off. The episode centers around him telling the now graduating kids he can't pay for college. I've seen it called the ""best unwatchable episode of TV ever"" because it's so cringe worthy. I've watched the office 8 times and I skip this episode, it's so painful to watch. Parks n' Rec is a better show though...fight me. So how do I begin with this. I am 26 and shortly before my grandma died last year she changed me to the executor of her estate. My grandma became enraged (rightly or wrongly) at my mom, aunts and uncle and basically at the 11th hour rewrote her considerable estate go to my generation (myself, sister and cousins) and one great grandkid (who I call niece because I truly don't understand all the ""removed"" stuff) so split evenly 6 ways. The condition was if the person was not through college, their share had to be spent on education first, otherwise I would keep it in a trust until they turned 27. The stipulation was as well that the person had to have a 3.5 gpa to get it for school, if not they had to get their grades up or wait until 27 (I really hope this is making sense). Basically under no circumstances do any of the cousins or great grand kid not get their money or do I get to keep it long term. My cousin and her daughter (niece to me) came asking me for the money so she can make payments to University of Arizona so she can start next week. Either they didn't know or didn't care about the GPA requirement because when I asked to see her report card from her last semester it showed me she all but failed her last semester. I don't even know how she graduated because she had something like a 1.2 GPA. I asked her how she got into UofA and she said she didn't really know or care, she just was ready to get to school to party. I basically said no, that this was not even remotely the stipulations of my Grandma's will and that I will be happy to give her the money for the spring semester if she gets her grades up to a 3.5 this fall.  That's when all hell broke loose. My mom, aunts and uncle already see me as a target because they are resentful of being written out of the will. My sister and one cousin are fine because they've already gotten their share but my other 2 cousins and niece have started circulating emails that I'm running my own version of ""Scott's Tots"" because I taking away money that was promised for education. There's also an undertone that I'm keeping the other 3 peoples money so I can save it for myself if they don't go to college. No amount of explanation is helping. I've tried to tell them that under no circumstances can I keep their shares. IF they don't go to school, they get the money when they turn 27, no questions asked. No one wants to hear this from me and everyone wants me to give my niece the money independent of her grades (and I imagine my other two cousins will see this as precedent so they get their money well before they turn 27). There is really nothing stopping me from doing it. I write all the checks from the trust and while it may not be in line with the will, no one is really going to question what I'm doing. I have to admit all the pressure is getting to me, especially the Scott's Tots thing because I don't want to be seen like that. Would I be the asshole if I withhold my niece's money for school until she gets her grades up?Edit: just for my own notes since I’m saving this thread and I guess if might help other people be clear.Cousin A (nieces mom), 38: paid.Cousin/sister  J, 32: paid.Me: paid Cousin B, 25: not paid.Cousin J2, 20: in school.Niece K, 18: not paid (subject of post).A, B and K are the ones causing all the issues and calling me 30 times a day."

Lia's mom seems to have a problem with me, or my sexuality or something, Lia is bi and her mom seems to wish she'd stayed with one of her male exes.So anyway at Christmas, we were taking photos and her mom was like ""OP, we want the photos to be family only.."" Lia started to protest, like ""we're married, mom"" but I didn't want an argument so I said ""it's ok, I'll take the pictures."" It was kind of cringy because lia's sister's husband, and cousin and his wife and son were there so there were definitely spouses and children included I was kind of annoyed and decided to not take the best ones... Just on purpose, focused the camera on the furniture rather than people, snapped pictures zoomed in awkwardly close, used unflattering flash, didn't hold my hands steady so they were blurry, took pictures on purpose when someone was looking away or coughing or something.Anyway I took like 30 pictures and they ranged from bad to horrible. And I gave the camera back and said that I hope they find a nice one to frame in there.After everything, Lia was angry on my behalf, said her mom had no right to treat me like that and I didn't have to say ""it's ok"" when it was totally rude. And I just started laughing and told her what I'd done. We snuck down to the dining room later that night and she lost it laughing at the pictures I'd taken. She even deleted some of the more decent ones.We're still waiting for her mom to plug her camera into the computer and see the pictures. We're planning on saying I tried my best but didn't know how to use a dslr camera if anyone says somethingAITA for taking bad photos on purpose?"
381,Not the A-hole,"AITA lost my temper and told my wife to ""just shut up already, you don't get a say in this"" after her constant inconsiderate nagging",22724,bovbi6,3116,"Asking for blunt honesty here because I can't deal with this drama right now so just tell me if I've been an asshole and if so I'll go and apologise. I'm currently planning my mother's funeral on behalf of my siblings (they live overseas and are not here yet). My mother and father were divorced but were on good terms. In particular, my mother was close friends with my father's new wife.This women - my father's current wife - has an ongoing dispute with my wife. They have a long long history of bad blood between each other. Both of them have said extremely hurtful things to one another. Obviously I think my wife is less of an asshole between the two, but both are definitely wrong for saying the things they have.Anyway even though I really dislike this women, I have to invite her to my mother's funeral service because: 1. She's my father's wife and 2. She was close friends with my mom. My wife was livid at finding out about this and insists I put my foot down and not let her attend the service.So for two long days she constantly nags me about this bringing it up every hour. I keep telling her the same thing about why she needs to come. I try to compromise by saying if my wife is so uncomfortable she doesn't need to attend, and I wont hold it against her. She refuses this as she wants to be there to support me.So a few hours ago she brings the topic up yet again and I lose my tempter. I tell her (paraphrasing)""Just shut up already. You don't get a day in this. You don't get to dictate my mother's funeral for Christs sake. Just leave me alone already.""I did not say it calmly. I yelled it and was definitely angry because I'm busy organising my mother's funeral. She has gone off crying and I'm left wondering if I went too far.I can't deal with this nonsense and I'm just going to accept whatever judgement is given and go with that."
382,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not agreeing to a name change for my daughter, despite her father wanting one?",22715,kgtluk,3113,"My ex and I were engaged, living together, and planning on trying for kids after the wedding. The wedding got delayed and I found out I was pregnant shortly after. My ex freaked out. Insisted it couldn't be his baby because he wasn't ready to be a dad, that this was all happening too fast and wasn't how we planned it, and said he needed some time to think everything over. He then moved out, blocked me, and didn't answer any kind of attempted contact for 10 months.Our child was born without him there and I named our daughter, ""Elizabeth Laura Smith"" without his input. Elizabeth because I like it and it reminds me of my favourite book character (I work in literature), Laura after my grandmother, and Smith is my surname. My ex has reached out. He said he waited this long because he wasn't sure how far along I was when we were together but he figured the baby had to have been born by now. I said that his timing was a little off, because she's 5 months old.Ex has said he's planning to sort out custody. We've not discussed logistics yet, but he's unlikely to get anything before she turns 1. He asked if I'd named her yet, and I told him what I'd named her.Ex then said he hates that name. He thinks it sounds old and stuffy. He says that as his mother, ""Mary"", has recently (November 2019) passed away, he wants to name our daughter Mary. He says Mary *must* be the first name and that I can have either Elizabeth or Laura as the middle name.I made clear, in no uncertain terms, that I will not change her name. I hate the name Mary. I hate how it sounds, both alone and with ""Elizabeth/Laura Smith"" on the end of it. Plus I didn't like his mother, either (though I didn't remind him of that).Ex said that if we're going to co-parent then I have to learn to compromise and this is the place to start, and that it's unfair that I got to choose both her first and middle name.I said that if he hadn't blocked me for the better part of a year, he'd have been able to say all of this when she was born.Ex said that the above is proof that I'm being petty and that he can't undo the past, but I can prevent any feelings of dislike/resentment from him over this name in future, and that as the father he should have a say in his daughter's name. He also says that he's willing to let her be a ""Smith"" and not force me to use his surname, which he feels is proof he has already negotiated.Am I the A-hole?"
383,Not the A-hole,AITA - for not allowing someone to propose during my wedding reception and for planning on not going to their wedding?,22714,ej5jdk,3215,"Longtime lurker, first time account/posting - I’ve debated posting this for a while now, but since I’ve been so vocal the last few days on this subreddit I figured it was time to find out if I was TA instead of just commenting on others.My wedding was September 21st, 2019. We had a fairly decent sized wedding. My cousin (on my stepdads side - we are not close whatsoever) and her boyfriend have only been dating not even 6 months at this point. I’ve met the guy once before my wedding and he never shows up to any family functions. We’re all having a great time at my wedding. My husband and I are mingling with guest while everyone dances. The next thing I know is my cousins boyfriend asks the DJ for his mike and goes to the center of the dance floor saying he has an “announcement” to make and calls my cousin over. So, I rush over and say, “Nope, no one is getting engaged during my special day especially during my reception. You can get engaged later tonight but not right now. It’s my day. Thank you for understanding.” and I go to walk away. My cousin starts puffing and my aunt (her mom) starts yelling at me and calling me an entitled brat. It causes a huge fight and they all end up leaving. My mom, stepdad, dad, and stepmom all are on my side and were even pissed that they think its okay to do that during a wedding they all paid for. My nana (step dads mom) says I was wrong and told me to apologize and call them over and allow him to propose. Needless to say, it didn’t happen. Flash forward to Christmas. Ugh, it was terrible! My stepdads entire side were rude and ignoring my husband and I. And of course, guess what happens! My cousin and her now fiancé announced their wedding date - September 21st, 2020! I’m beyond pissed and so not planning to go. It’s my damn one year wedding anniversary! My family is upset that they would do that to piss me off for not allowing them to get engaged during my reception. My cousin says they chose to get married on their one year engagement anniversary. Either way, regardless of the real reason, I’m still upset. Of course, my nana is super excited. So reddit, aita for not allowing them to get engaged during my wedding reception and aita for not attending the wedding on my one year anniversary?EDIT: You guys have been so sweet!

384,Not the A-hole,AITA for sabotaging my little brother's food on purpose?,22721,khmocx,1747,"My little brother is 18. I'm 20. I am staying with my family for the holidays and thought it'd be a nice time but I forgot that they treat me like a housekeeper. I do almost all the chores and I don't mind if its MY chore. Obviously, if I notice the dishwashers full, I empty it. If I cook, I clean up. If I make a mess, I clean up. However, if my little brother makes a mess. He makes me clean up. If I refuse and tell him to do it himself, he tells my parents and they side with him and just bug me until I do it. My brother also asks me to cook for him. He pulls out brownie mix and is like ""make this."" I always am like: ""Sure, I can make it but you have to help."" He gets mad and says ""I helped by taking out the box!"" And when I refused to make stuff for him or tell him to make it himself, he'll throw a fit and tell our parents. Lately, he keeps asking me to make stuff and I get frustrated going back and forth about why can't he make shit himself or just ask our parents. So I make the food he asks, but I always add stuff he doesn't like. (coincidentally, he hates a ton of stuff I love to eat ) So if he asks for brownies and refuses to help, I put nuts in it. He hates them and I like them. He came over to see the brownies and got mad at me and told me he hated nuts and can't eat the brownies anymore. I just said, ""too bad, make it yourself next time or help me and tell me not to put nuts in."" I thought he'd learn his lesson to at least help but he keeps asking for stuff and I just keep putting stuff in that he doesn't like.He finally got fed up and said he's not eating because I keep making stuff with stuff he doesn't like. I just shrugged and told him to make his own food then. He told my parents of course and they just told me to stop being an asshole and make food for him. It was my last day at home so I just told them to make food for him if they're so concerned before I left. Now my parents are upset with me and my brother is angry with me and I am wondering if I was too petty"
385,Not the A-hole,AITA for being “too honest” about why I don’t drink?,22710,k1z30n,2130,"I’m 33 and I had a serious drinking problem since a young age. My dad was an alcoholic so booze never lacked in our house. It nearly killed me when I was only 27 and was in the ER for alcohol poisoning. It was too close a call and after that things had to change. With my wife’s support, I went to rehab and proud to say I’ve been sober 5 1/2yrs. My flatmate invited our friends over yesterday. It was 7 of us in total, including his friend, “Mark.” I’ve met Mark maybe 3-4 times over the last 2 years and while we’re “friendly” i honestly don’t know him that well. But you can tell he’s a party-guy. Likes to get loud, take shots, makes gross comments sometimes, etc.Mark brought several cases of beer and a bottle of tequila with him so everyone was drinking and having a good time. Mark kept offering me drinks the entire night, which I’d politely decline. It’s like he made it his personal mission to get me to drink by egging me on, saying everytime he sees me I’m either drinking a soda/water and it’s okay to let loose sometimes. He resorted to teasing me into drinking, calling me “princess” I don’t know what that had to do with not wanting to drink.All my friends there knew what I was like before, how bad my drinking was so they kept trying to steer the conversation so he’d forget about me. But every now and then he’d hand me a shot glass or a beer and would not let it go even after telling him yet again that I didn’t want to drink. My wife became uncomfortable with his behavior (I think she was worried I’d actually drink). She grabbed the shot glass from me, dumped it in the sink and told him to stop it already. He looked between us and grinned like he “understood now”. Mark joked that maybe we should get my wife drunk first, then that’ll get her to loosen up the leash she has on me. I’ll admit, that made me see red. I got in his face and told him, “actually I don’t drink because last time I did I almost f*cking died so unless you want me puking everywhere and having seizures you should shut up and leave my wife out of this.”Wiped the smile off him real quick and he apologized. The rest of night went on and he finally left me alone. Our flatmate did confront me in the morning because he thinks I was too honest with Mark and it wasn’t his fault he didn’t know he was just joking around and I made him feel bad. Our other friends agree he was being too pushy and deserved being told off, my wife agrees so he’s the only one right now that’s taking Mark’s side.He said I could’ve ignored him until he gave up instead of bringing up an uncomfortable truth from my past. Now yes I could’ve just told Mark the truth without full details but felt that’s none of his business and a “no” should’ve been enough. I only got carried away when he decided to include my wife in his jokes. So yes I am wondering if I was a bit of an a-hole for what I told him instead of keeping the peace."

They've sent out all the invites and stuff. One of my sister's bridesmaids is her current fiancé's ex. They're all friends and quite close so it's not weird for them at all. My sister often makes jokes about how all lesbians know each other and how lesbian relationships tend to work. For example my girlfriend and I were together a year before we moved in together, and my sister joked that ""that's like a decade in Lesbian Years"". My girlfriend asked me about the ex being in the wedding party and why they chose to do so cause it seemed like it would be awkward. I said it isn't for them and she asked why. I just shrugged and said ""I don't know man, lesbians."" My girlfriend got pretty mad at me and said that was homophobic and playing into stereotypes and I shouldn't have said it. My sister laughed when I told her but idk, the things my gf said are sticking with me and making me feel pretty bad. What do you lot think?"

She makes comments about African Americans being ""ugly"" but the race she has the most prejudice towards is anyone who is Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc. She generalizes the way they speak and mocks them, she says they're all ugly, makes comments about how they ""shouldn't drive"" because they ""can't see"" properly, etc.I've heard this all throughout my life from her and every time I've wanted to call her out but was afraid of what she'd say because all my life she's been a ticking time bomb and most of the time I'm too exhausted to deal with her constantly going on a rampage of saying cruel things and then playing the victim after it all.This time in particular however, I was watching ""A Silent Voice"" beautiful anime movie by the way, it brought me to tears.  One of the scenes showing how Shouko speaks aloud was on while my mom was in the room, and of course as per routine she made a stupid comment basically stating that she's surprised anyone batted an eye at how she talks given that it's supposedly ""as unintelligible as any other Asian.""I spoke up and said ""Oh shit, I forgot I can't watch what I enjoy without you trying too hard to make us laugh with an unfunny racist comment."" She said ""Excuse me?"" to which I replied that I was pretty sure she heard me, and then she asked me what it was like to have a ""fetish"" for Asian people (???) so I said ""What's it like to have such a bland personality that being a racist bitch is your main trait?""She BLEW UP and told me I had no right to speak to her that way because she was my mother.  Basically I shrugged and I said that I'm treating her as I would any prejudiced person.  I was grounded for being ""disrespectful"" because apparently being racist is nothing but an opinion /s.Pretty much the same hour I walked out of the house and announced that I was sleeping over at a friend's house because there's no way I was gonna serve a punishment for calling out a racist.  I'm getting mixed reactions.  Some say I was fully in the right and didn't need to change a thing, others say while I was in the right I should've just taken the punishment because I knew what the outcome would be.  AITA here reddit?"
388,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my wife that she needed to be a my graduation an hour before she needed to because she is always late for things?,22702,lhhbjc,3761,"I (27m) have been with my wife (27f) for 8 years. For 5 of those years I was in the military and I developed the habit of being early for everything  I do. It is a huge pet peeve of mine if people are late for things when they could have been on time. If something happens out of your control and you are late then I totally understand. My wife is the type of person who is always late. Throughout our relationship she has made us late for events and it has been embarrassing. One of the worst incidents was when I was home on leave. We were planning on meeting my mom for breakfast ( I haven’t seen in two years) at 9:00am. I told my wife the day before that I want to leave our place at 8:30 so we can get there by 8:50. We both wake up at 7:00 and I’m ready by 8:00. At that point she hasn’t even started to get ready. I remind her multiple times that we need to leave by 8:30 but she kept saying “we have time and I’ll be fast”. She didn’t start getting ready until 8:30. Long story short we were a hour late and we lost our reservation because of it. I was pissed but kept it to myself until we got home. I told her that I hated that she always made us late and it can be embarrassing sometimes. She apologized and said she would work on it. It never got any better. If anything she would get short with me if I mention the time. Fast forward 3 years and I was graduating the police academy. The graduation was set to begin at 10:00am and people could start showing up at 9:15. Well... knowing my wife and not wanting her to be walking in as the ceremony was beginning, I told her that the graduation started at 9:15 and she needed to be there at 8:30 to find parking.Well sure enough I see her driving in AT 9:15!!! Of course I was a little pissed but glad that my plan worked. The rest of the graduation went as planned and I was happy. Afterwards a group of us and our spouses went out to celebrate. At one point my wife mentions that she was lucky that the ceremony got pushed back or she was going to be late. My friends were confused and told her that they saw her car and that she showed up right on time. My wife then asked what time was the ceremony supposed to start? They all said 10:00am. At that point my wife just stared at me and I knew she was pissed. When we got home my wife blew up on me! She said she was pissed that I lied to her and didn’t understand why I did. I told her that I knew that she would be late and so I told her a slightly earlier time be safe. She said she was hurt and felt that I had manipulated her. This is where I might be the asshole. I said “ how do you think I feel? I told you that the graduation started at 9:15 and you were still late! You knew how hard I worked throughout the academy and you couldn’t even be on time for this one occasion. She got quiet and just said she’s going to bed. She has barely spoken to me over the last couple days and I don’t know if I was too harsh. So AITA?"
389,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling my family which of my children is biologically mine?,22704,kthohc,1808,"I have 2 kids, 'Clark' and 'Kent'. While they have the same father, only one of them is biologically my child. They were born within 6 months of each other. The boys are currently 6, and for various reasons I have full custody of both of them.I didn't speak to anyone in my family for several years, and we got back in touch in 2019. Due to the boys' ages, my family know I couldn't have carried both, unless I have the gestation period of a hamster or the longest labour ever. I have explained to them how this all came to be, but in my explanation I neglected to tell them which was my biological child.Due to my ex having a type, the other woman looked enough like me that the boys could pass for twins. Same dark hair, blue eyes, pale skin, and both cleft chins and dimples. My brother jokes that they look like tiny Supermen. People who know them refer to them as twins because aside from a few minor differences, they're practically identical. Frankly, if they were closer in age and I'd had full custody of both from the time they were born, I suspect I would have mixed them up a lot as babies.Shortly before Clark's birthday last year, my mum asked if she could see Clark's birth certificate. I asked why and she said she wanted to know the exact time he was born, so I told her. She asked if she could see the certificate anyway. I asked why. She said she just wanted to check. I said I'm his mother, I know when he was born. Then she asked the same thing about Kent and we went through the same conversation all over again. Mum eventually admitted that she just wanted to see the birth mother's name on each certificate, which isn't even how that works and I told her as much.This led to an argument where my stance was that I'm their mother, biology is irrelevant. Mum says if biology is irrelevant then it's not a big deal to tell her which of them is biologically mine. I said if she's so hung up on biology, then clearly it's a big deal to her and I don't want it to be a big deal, especially as the boys themselves don't know.Mum feels this is incredibly selfish, narcissistic, and overall wrong. She feels that if biology isn't such a big issue, then I should have no problem telling her whether Clark or Kent is my biological son, and that accusing her of potential favouritism or something similar with her bio grandchild is an unfair judgement with no actual reasoning to it.My boyfriend agrees that I shouldn't tell anyone at least until my sons have decided for themselves if they want to know and want other people to know, but my entire family agree with mum that I'm being unreasonably selfish and that my actions now are more likely to cause issues than mum's potential actions later.Am I in the wrong?"
390,Not the A-hole,"AITA friend is always late so we give her a earlier time, she actually showed up on time and is pissed",22689,j08k0n,1813,"Our friend isabel is usually 1-2 hours late to anything we do because she unorganized and spends an excessive amount if time getting ready which she tries to do last minute. We got sick of waiting 1-2 hours every time we go out so wed started telling her to show up at 4 when we are actually meeting at 5:30. We did this like 3 times and she was usually like 10 minutes late still. Well here's the problem, we were meeting up last night, we told her 6:30 last night and we were actually meeting at around 7:45. She showed up 25 minutes early and is fucjing pissed that we did this, she found out we gave her wrong times intentionally. She says were assholes and she felt betrayed. I told her it's her own fault for being hours late consistently and it was the only way to get her on time"
391,Not the A-hole,AITA for laughing at my mom after she and my dad insisted i tell my friend’s boyfriend to leave my house?,22676,l3d4ja,1295,"I (F20) moved out on my 18th birthday and never looked back. I mostly moved out due to how strict my parents were. When i say strict, i don’t mean something like home by 10pm. I mean, I wasn’t allowed to have friends older than me (even by a few months) i wasn’t allowed any guy friends. If i had a project to work on at school and got partnered with a guy, my mom would tell my teachers to make me do it alone. I was only allowed on my phone if someone (mom or dad) was there to monitor what i was doing. Weekdays my bedtime was 9pm and weekends 9:30pm. I could only have sleepovers if it was at my house and all of my friends have to be questioned to make sure they were “clean” meaning, they didn’t have boyfriends, no tattoos, went to church, you get it. So you can imagine, i had literally 1 or 2 friends. By 18, i didn’t have any plans, i just packed my stuff and left. My parents weren’t happy and tried for months to get me to come home but i didn’t plan on it. Anyways, i landed a damn good job and was able to get my first apartment shortly after. My friend is over at my house almost everyday with her boyfriend and we just hang out. I didnt cut out all contact with my parents but i limit it to only only special occasions. My mom wanted to have a zoom family call whatever it’s called and asked me to join. I figured what the hell i’ll join and say hi. As i’m talking to my little cousin, in the background you could see my friend’s boyfriend come into the living room area. Everyone’s face kinda froze and i didn’t think much of it. My mom asked who it was and i told her and she immediately gets annoyed? She started asking why he was leaving my bedroom, which he didn’t. The bathroom is the same way towards the bedroom so i could see why it would look like he left from my room. She and my dad proceeds to ask me why i have guys at my home, why is he 21 hanging around me (i just turned 20 but yea) it was like i was 15 againMy mom then insists i have him leave. At this point my friend and her boyfriend hears this and goes like wtf? I didn’t know what else to do but laugh. I said “are you out of your mind” and laughed some more. I realized they were serious and said my goodbyes and hung up. Later i started getting messages that my parents are upset i laughed at them and my family says it’s in my best interest to apologize because i was being an asshole for laughing. AITA for laughing?~~~Edit- I did not expect to have this much feedback! Thank you everyone who took time to comment and a big thank you for the awards! For those of you asking why i would think i was the asshole, it’s mostly cause i laughed at them then hung up so i thought it was rude and asshole-ish especially after being told i was by my aunt as well.I seen a lot of people telling me to go no contact. I’d feel terrible if i did such a thing but someone did point out they’ll never change their ways so i think i might have to. you know, i’ve got no idea how to set boundaries but i’m sure there’s a few articles that can help me with that. I did block them from all of my social media accounts except facebook so i think that counts? I’m not familiar with setting boundaries sorryI found out from my little cousin that my mom has been asking where i live so now i’m kind of scared for that. Though not many know my address, if she ask the right people she might find out i hope not."
392,Not the A-hole,AITA for not taking my pregnant homophobic sister in?,22664,jdjl87,1550,"My sister (20f) and I (27f) don’t get along. I’m gay, and when she was 14 she started being horrible to me, calling me slurs and saying I was going to burn in hell and other typical religious homophobic things. She is the golden child so obviously my parents sided with her, she would make me cry and they would tell me to deal with it and expected me to still be nice to her. After a while, I cut them all out of my life. Best decision ever.3 years ago I married the love of my life, my parents were invited but they didn’t show, no doubt because of my sister. Still hurt. My wife L and I are both very lucky and have amazing jobs and a big house. About a week ago, my parents and sister showed up to my house (no idea how they know I live there) and wanted to talk to me. Turns out sister’s pregnant and they essentially want me to let her move in for free AND pay for everything for her and the baby. There was no apology for anything. I was in shock and my sister was going off about how we have so much space and we could afford to help her out.I said no. I told them we couldn’t take her in because we currently have L’s two little half sisters staying with us because their mom is very high risk, so we don’t have anymore space. They were pissed and were going off about how I was supposed to help my family and that I was choosing L’s family over my own, I told them they were not my family. I told them everything they had done and say to me and they said I needed to let it go and move on. I asked them to leave. Even if we had space I wouldn’t want her here.Since then I have gotten so many messages from them and other family members saying I need to help them and take her in. I reminded them of what she has been like to me, and they say I need to be the bigger person and that this will bring us together. Thing is, my parents are going to have to take money out of their retirement fund if I don’t help. They were good parents growing up, when my sister started her bs I was already out of the house. So people have said that i would really be helping them, not my sister. L said we could give her some money, but I don’t want to do that either. AITA?Edited because I forgot to add that I don’t feel for her at all, I just feel bad about my parents.Update - thank you all for the kind words! We are not taking her in but might give my parents some money in the future if we see they are struggling. Also, my sister is 7 months pregnant and just recently told my parents because she couldn’t hide it anymore, so they are desperate because there’s no time to save up now. My mom just sent me my sister’s baby registry and I can’t believe her!!! She is living off my parents and doesn’t have a job but is asking people to get her a $300 car seat and a $700 stroller.Edit - Please don’t post this anywhere.Edit- Wow! I came back to like a thousand more replies, seriously thank you all for your advice. Yes, I know my parents are also to blame. They have never been ‘homophobic’ but they never told her off because they wanted to ‘keep the peace’ and I know that’s a shitty excuse but I would only see them like once a month while my sister was there full time and they never want to upset her. And the wedding - my dad called me because my sister was upset she wasn’t invited and asked me to invite her but I said no so they didn’t show up. The main reason I feel like I need to help them is because they put me through college. I got a scholarship and my parents paid for the rest which was still a lot of money. My sister went to a community college so they didn’t pay nearly as much for her.Thank you all again!"
393,Not the A-hole,AITA for not marrying the girl I'm supposed to be and causing major problems for my family?,22666,hefhgy,1684,"This will sound unbelievable to those not from my country. All I can say is that it is real.When I was 5, my parents brought my dad’s friend’s daughter X (about 3) to live with me and sister Y (7). X’s family was poor and couldn’t support their children (they had 6) so they sent X here because they really trusted my parents. X, Y, and I grew up together, and my parents were awesome to all three of us. I had a lot of fun growing up and I am extremely close to my family.  I’m now 29. Three years back, I went abroad for my masters and then went back to my country. There, I met a girl P and we fell in love. I’d like to propose soon and felt like this would be a good time to introduce P to my family (Y already knew of her and P just graduated). This weekend I told my family that I would like for them to meet someone special and set-up a video call. No idea who they were expecting, but when they realized P was my girlfriend, everything just blew up.  Apparently, they had already “discussed and arranged” my marriage with X years back, and she was the one I would have to marry. X was aware, her father had told her. Cue lots of screaming and yelling, including some choice words from X to P about how she’s a “modern girl” (euphemism in my culture for slut) and how she must be after me for my money (she comes from a richer family). I was just too shocked to react initially. The next day I told my parents that I look at X as family. They started saying ridiculous things like they’ve never let her into my room (while apparently Y was allowed) and drawing all sorts of other parallels between X and Y trying to demonstrate why X wasn’t like my sister. They also said stuff like no one can understand me better than X and that she will “keep the family together” while P will “alienate” me from them. They also told me I’m ruining the family.X also cried nonstop and then shut herself in the room, accusing me of not wanting her only because she was poor amongst other things. She also said no one from her village would marry her now because her family has told everyone back home that she’s going to be marrying me. My sister was not aware of any of this either. Now – I told X I don’t care that no one will marry her from her village (it is a likely possibility) or that her life is “ruined”. I also told my parents I won’t ruin my life for them to be able to “keep their word”. X’s father is coming to our house once he’s able to (transport restrictions still in place), but he had a long phone call with parents. I’m sure a LOT of emotional blackmail is to follow, and I already feel rather guilty about X because she’s a nice girl. My sister is on my side. But even if my parents cut me off and at the risk of X ruining her life, I am not going to go ahead with this at all. AITA?Edit: A lot of people asking me where I'm from - It's a SE Asian country, just don't want to say if it's the exact place you guys are asking about. X was apparently aware I didn't know. But she was told by my parents and hers that I'm a ""Family man"" and will do the ""right thing"" so there's no need to worry. She's basically accused me of wrecking the family too. My sister is really upset on my behalf, and also that she wasn't told any of this. My sister's family (her husband and his parents) have said if there's any sort of confrontation, they'll be there to back me up.Not sure if this detail counts, but P is also from my country but also came abroad to study. So that's not a reason as to why my parents are unaccepting of P. They just want me to marry X."
394,Not the A-hole,Aita: For yelling at my fiance for giving my dog away?,22634,ilhb1n,2691,"My best friend Kelly passed away 2 years ago, We were both childhooh friends, she adopted her dog Leo 7 years ago and we became attached to him and he was the bond that made our friendship stronger, When She passed away, I took him in a few months after she passed and it felt like she was there everytime he runs in or cuddles with me.I recently moved in with my fiance (he lives out of town) and brought Leo in with me, I could sense that my fiance didn't feel comfertable with having Leo live with us, he sat with me and asked if we could offer him up for adoption since I been busy with college and he was busy working, I told him the story behind taking Leo in and he sort of dropped it.During the last couple of weeks, I was visiting my parents and asked my fiance to take care of him while I was away.He said okay, I called everynight to check in on Leo and I could hear him bark in background, but a few days later, he stopped. My fiance told me he was outside.I came back, And I noticed Leo was gone, I waited til my fiance got back and he sat me down and explained that while he was out with Leo, a family approached him and asked him if he was putting him up for adoption and said they were willing to provide a home for him, since their son who didn't let go of Leo lost his dog who looked the same/age as him.He said he felt sorry for the kid and decided to give them Leo, I was in shock, I lost it and yelled at him that it wasn't his place because Leo was mine, he lashed out saying I was hurting his feeling and overreacting, I told him he needed to get him back, he just gave me their number and told me to handle it.I've had a hard time trying to get him back and I did eventually, I packed up and moved back with my parents, My fiance is calling and apologizing then saying that He can no longer pay for rent on his own, I didn't reply, my family say I should forgive him and get over it, But I just couldn't, I feel heavy and unable to even talk to him anymore."
395,Not the A-hole,AITA for treating my two daughters' pregnancies differently?,22630,gaw4yl,3399,"When my oldest told me she was pregnant, she was still in college, unemployed and the baby's father was refusing to be involved. I was not thrilled but I provided all the help I could and took care of her. I was having a health crisis at the time so I was very stressed out. I love my grandchild but the birth didn't exactly happen in the happiest of circumstances.My oldest daughter ended up back in a relationship with the baby's father and they are happy and stable now. My younger daughter announced her pregnancy a few months ago and the situation cannot be more different. She's married to her husband who she's been with for several years, they're both financially stable and the baby is clearly planned.I have had zero stress dealing with my daughter's pregnancy this time and I've been generally happier about it. I was unknowingly proving I was more excited this time around which I have since corrected. I also planned a baby shower for my youngest which I didn't do for my oldest.My oldest is furious. I can imagine why but I feel she should understand how different the circumstances were.She's said some really hurtful things to me and has prevented me from seeing my grandchild, even on the phone. I have already apologized a few times but it hasn't made a difference.My youngest is now having some pregnancy related health issues and we're feeling very scared. I got a text from my oldest yesterday that if it were her having a health scare during her pregnancy, I would've probably celebrated. I broke down crying because I was so hurt.Am I wrong here?"
396,Not the A-hole,"AITA for recreating a ""secret"" cookie recipe the person does not give out?",22618,i3087o,3116,"My boyfriend's mom makes theses amazing cookie bars. She makes them for the holidays and family gatherings and people always request that she brings them. I asked for the recipe once and she laughed and said no - that it was ""hers"" and she doesn't give it out to anyone. I dropped it and never asked again.I started baking a LOT during the pandemic. It's been fun for me in my downtime. I decided with my free time to try to recreate the cookie bars my boyfriend's mom makes. I pulled up recipes that sounded similar from online blogs and started baking and tweaking. It took about 5 recipes and batches but I finally nailed it down (her secret recipe ended up essentially being a cookie bar known as a Carmelita).I then decided to make it ""my own"" and improve it to my tastes. I used higher quality chocolate, made sauce with local homemade caramels, used flakey sea salt on top, vanilla bean paste instead of extract, added a pinch of this fantastic organic cinnamon I had on hand. The results were over the top delicious. My boyfriend declared they are better than his mom's and he finished off half a pan in 2 days.He was Facetiming with his mom Saturday and eating one. She asked what it was and he said ""One of your caramel bars. Jo found a recipe online but made it even better."" SHE LOST IT. She started yelling about how awful I was for making ""her"" cookies and how I had no right. He told her that she was overreacting and quickly ended the call.She started blowing up my phone with nasty texts about what an asshole I am. I explained to her that I found the recipe I used online where it was very public, I had actually tweaked that to make it more my own, and that I wasn't ever planning on bringing them to an event she's at so I did not see what the big deal was. She didn't care. She called me names and told me I was wrong for baking a recipe that I knew was similar to hers. She isn't speaking to me or her son.While I don't think my boyfriend should have made the comment about how I ""made it even better"" to his mom...taking that out of the equation she thinks I'm an asshole for even making them to begin with. I disagree, but from the texts from her and a couple other family members of hers, they think I crossed a line. AITA for recreating this recipe?\*\*Edit to add this, since people are asking - and edit to correct that I make my caramel sauce WITH homemade caramels from a local shop:I used the recipe below for the ""base"" for my bars, but then made the tweaks I mentioned above. I used high quality chocolate, homemade caramels from a local candy place, I add 1Tbs of vanilla bean paste into my caramel when I melt it, and a pinch (probably 1/4 tsp. or less) of a very mild organic cinnamon into the oatmeal mixture. I top it with flakey sea salt. They are GREAT the regular way though, because the tweaks I made to my last batch (the batch that got me in trouble because they were declared better than the inspiration) add up in price quickly.[]("
397,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my cousin I won’t make an exception for her son at my wedding?,22601,i6sf1o,2349,"I (26F) am getting married in about two months. I sent out my wedding invitations recently and at the bottom it says “ADULTS ONLY. NO EXCEPTIONS.” First let me say that I love kids. But my fiancé and I made the decision to not allow kids/babies to our ceremony because they get bored, cry, won’t sit still, have tantrums... and I just don’t want that to happen during our wedding. We’re also going to have an open bar, and I don’t particularly want a bunch of drunk adults around my little cousins or my friend’s children. I have a cousin, we’ll call her Sam, that text me last night saying “so you’re dead honest seriously telling me I cannot bring (her son) to your wedding”- to which I said yes. Sam responds “then I can’t come and that f****** kills me. I just want you to know how badly I want to be there and I have dreamt my entire life of standing next to you at your wedding. But I just can’t want to be somewhere with someone who doesn’t want the other half of my heart there.” She’s trying guilt trip me into letting her bring her son. Saying “and I’ve confided in my best friends and they say it’s your wedding it’s your right to have it the way you want, but yeah. I just want you to know it’s not vengeance when I don’t come. I’ll probably cry like a b**** the entire day.” I suggested that she take her son (he’s seven) to his friends house for a few hours, so that she can attend. She says “I can’t just tell him no and leave him somewhere. I’m not strong enough to do that to his sensitive little heart. I could, if he wasn’t so aware and sensitive. It would hurt him too much. He’s too smart to manipulate.”I’m not asking her to manipulate her son. I’m asking that she be an adult, and tell him he can’t come and that children aren’t allowed to attend, so she’ll take him to his friends while she’s gone.Not to mention, that she’s angry that I didn’t choose her to be my Maid of Honor. I chose my step-sister. While on the phone, Sam said “I don’t mean any offense by this, but FUCK HER.” She’s literally only mad because my dad cheated on my mom 10 years ago and married the woman he cheated with. She hates my sister, because she hates my step mom. I ended up being on the phone with her for half an hour talking to her about this. With her constantly telling me “I’m trying to get sober, so I just wanted to talk to you and tell you how I feel.” Which to me, sounds like she’s going to blame me if I still tell her no, and she decides to drink/so drugs again. We ended the phone call with her saying “will you just promise me one thing, even if it’s a lie? Will you just promise me that you’ll consider it, and that you’ll talk to your fiancé about it?” So I told her yes, that I promised I’d consider it/talk to him about it. And I did, I considered it, I talked (angry cried) to him, and I’m not changing my mind. Am I the Asshole?***************************************UPDATE: I texted her two days ago, and used the wording suggested by u/sunny_sally. “There’s nothing I want more than for you to be at my wedding. I love (her son), but after speaking to (fiancé), we came to the conclusion that we still do not feel comfortable having kids at our wedding. This is a decision we made before we started the planning, knowing that some people might disagree with it. If you aren’t able to get a baby sitter, I would completely understand why you wouldn’t come. And I also spoke with (her step dad), he said he will be attending.”She responded in less than a minute and said “ok.”So I guess we’ll see how this goes."

No one really cared until she started giving unsolicited advice and lectures. My lecture had to with my sweet tooth. Yes, I love Kit Kats. But I don't get cavities, have no health issues, go to the gym four days a week and I don't smoke or drink. I'm about 15lbs overweight and that's not bad for a 40yo man. After one too many lectures about how bad Kit Kats are and how I should replace them with bananas, I casually asked her what her excuse was for being at least 50lbs overweight? I reminded her that like every other post on her social media was her at some restaurant or deli or whatever eating something that I wouldn't even eat. She really didn't have an answer except it's not about calories but what's in the food that counts before running off crying and starting WWIII with my brother. She still hasn't forgiven me and I told her that I don't care. Move on or be gone."
399,Not the A-hole,AITA for not shaving my legs for work?,22589,ct8w0a,1616,"So I’m a 21 year old female. I feel like I should say these thing about myself because these are usually what people ask or say when they find out I rarely shave my legs. I’m straight, I’m very feminine, and I just don’t like to waste my time or money on shaving my legs. Also I’m not a hairy person at all! You can barley see my leg hair, arm hair or even my god damn eyebrows. The only time I shave is when I’m dating a new guy in my life and I’ve been with my current BF for 3 years now. Also he doesn’t give a rats ass if I shave my legs. So I work for a promotion company where I travel and work at event and festivals. But today I had to go into the office to grab some materials and my boss was there in his office so I stoped to say hi before I left out. When I ducked in he awkwardly asked me if we could talk about something. I said sure and came in and he shut the door. He was so red and stuttering but finally he told me we needed to speak about hygiene. I was in literal shock. I was so embarrassed and asked him what he meant. My boss then proceeded to tell me that a few people complained I didn’t shave my legs and they said it went against company policy that I wasn’t being hygienic. I was even more shocked. I told him I didn’t understand what that had to do with me shaving my legs and he was just absolutely quiet. I asked him if he shaved his legs and he still said nothing. I then stood up and said if we were gonna keep talking about this I’d prefer HR to be there and he just told me that we didn’t need to discuss it any further. Later today I just got an email from HR saying that they would like to set up a meeting for next week to talk further about the discussion that happened today. I’m freaking out and it’s making me so anxious.AITA for not shaving my legs for my job?EDIT: So people giving my boss hate i understand but I’m not mad at him and don’t blame him. Im not sure but I feel like someone was in fact pressuring him to talk to me about this because he is a usually very chill and a nice guy who usually doesn’t even force dress code and stuff. But also I really have no clue what really brought this on all of a sudden since I’ve worked there 8 months with no incident."
400,Not the A-hole,AITA for demanding my colleagues use my “offensive” name?,22555,js79dt,3280,"Throwaway because I am a lurker and don’t have an actual Reddit account.So, I work for an international company with many different nationalities, recently I have been assigned to a mainly American team (which means I have to work weird hours due to time zones but I’m a single guy with no kids so I can work around that). I live/work in Germany and prior to this team I only used English in writing and spoke German with everyone.We had a couple of virtual meetings and I noticed some of the Americans mispronouncing my name - they called me Mr. Birch. So I corrected them, my surname is Bič (Czech noun meaning “a whip”, happens to be pronounced just like “bitch”). My name is not English and doesn’t have English meaning. Well, turns out the Americans felt extremely awkward about calling me Mr Bitch and using first names is not a norm here. HR got in touch with me and I just stated that I don’t see a problem with my name (and I don’t feel insulted by being called “Mr Bitch”), I mean, the German word for customer sounds like “cunt” in Czech, it’s just how it is.Well apparently the American group I’m working with is demanding a different representative (they also work from home and feel uncomfortable saying “curse words”(my name) in front of their families), but due to the time zone issues the German office is having problems finding a replacement for me, nobody wants to work a 2am-7am office shift from home. So management approached me asking to just accept being called Mr Birch but honestly I am a bit offended. A coworker even suggested that I have grounds for discrimination complaint.Am I the asshole for refusing to answer to a different name?Edit due to common question: using first names is not our company policy due to different cultural customs, for many (me included) using first names with very distant coworkers is not comfortable and the management ruled that using surnames and titles is much more suitable for professional environment. I am aware that using first names is common in the USA, please mind that while the company is international, the US office is just one of the branches.Edit 2: many people are telling me to suck it up and change my name or the pronunciation, because many American immigrants did that. So I just want to remind you: I am not an immigrant. I do not live in the US nor do I intend to. I deal with 10ish Americans in video calls and a few dozen in email communication. Then I also deal with hundreds of others at my job - French, Indian, Japanese, Russian... I live in Germany and am from Czech Republic. I know this is a shock for some but really, Americans are a minority in this story.Edit 3: I deal with other teams as well, everyone calls me Mr Bič, having one single team call me by my first name (which is impolite) or by changing my name is troublesome because things like Birch really do sound different. Someone mentioned Beach, which still sounds odd but it’s better than Birch. Right now I have three options as last resort, if they absolutely cannot speak my name and if German office doesn’t re-assign me: 1. use beach, 2. use Mr Representative, 3. switch to German, which is our office’s official language. Nobody has issues with Bič when speaking German. (Yeah the last option is kind of silly, I know for a fact not everyone in the team speaks German and we would still use English in writing)Edit4: last edit. Dear Americans, I know you use first names in business/work environment. Please please please understand that the rest of the world is not America. Simply using English for convenience sake does not mean we have to follow specific American customs."
401,Not the A-hole,AITA for deciding I won't give any Christmas gifts this year after my mom cancelled a transaction on my card?,22556,k3uz4l,1371,"I'm still angry over this and I may not write very well, and also I probably don't judge the situation very well being this angry so I came to you.I'm a student. I have a student bank account, where my college gives me money for transport (when we had physical classes) or scholarship. These kind of bank accounts have no fees, but are age restricted (can't have one if you're over 25) and need an overseer. When I asked the bank about it, they told me it's just a security thing so I chosen mom because she's more tech savvy than dad.Well through some incredible luck I managed to get only top grades last year so I was awarded a study scholarship. Great! I've been saving it up, looking forward to word wide Black Friday, eyeing an amazing drawing tablet. I do digital art on very old intros, the tablet I was eyeing is as big as my monitor, is a display one and all around amazing.Black Friday rolls in, and Amazon Germany (closest to me) has it in stock at an amazing price! A price I could afford! I was so damn happy, I ordered it. Then I got a notice that the bank refused the card. I emailed Amazon (their customer service is so fast) and we went over the card details and such making sure it was alright. It was and they advised me to call my bank. It was odd, I had bought things online in the past with this card and it went through. I had enough money for it (even extra) so I thought maybe they had technical difficulties. But it was too late in the day to call and they don't work weekends, so I left an email.Only to find out today that for ""big transactions"" they ask for agreement from the overseer and that mine cancelled the transfer. I was like wtf and confronted mom about it (who throughout the weekend acted oblivious) and she told me that of course she couldn't let me ""throw money on something I don't need"" and that ""I wouldn't have money for Christmas presents if I bought that"". Then she had the audacity to ask me what I was planning to get my family this year.I told her that they won't get anything more than a bread shadow* from me and I went to my room and cried on the carpet. I missed out on the offer, I can't afford the tablet anymore and it's all because mom wanted Christmas gifts. And no, I won't get her anything. Last year she got me a blouse too small for me that she later took for herself. She can gift herself this year too.*Bread shadow= expression for nothing in my languageEdit: there are so many comments and I thank you all, I'm trying to reply to all of you but it'll take a whileEdit 2: thank you so so much for people offering me money in comments and dm but I can't accept that. I'm really grateful for you trying to help but I really can't take that. I'm really thankful for the offers and advice#Edit 3: all hail u/Epic-Hamster!So many people offered me advice, money, their tablets or other means of helping and I'm really thankful to you all! Also, lots of you told me to check the sale that's going on right now but the tablet I ordered wasn't on sale, yet u/Epic-Hamster found it (same specs different seller) at sale at an even better price than the Black Friday sale! I ordered it, it went through this time, and I'm so happy and excited!Thank you, from all of my heart to everyone. I'm still going to reply to all of you, even if it's going to take me all night. Happy holidays for all of you!Edit: it seems like I can't reply to you guys anymore sadly but if you want to you can send me a pm, I don't think I'll sleep this night anyway#FAQ(Now I really get why these are called frequently asked questions)• This account I have to have because of my Uni, but I'm going to make dad the overseer and also open an account at another bank (a normal one) and transfer the money in small amounts to that one so I don't bother dad with it• Also considering asking him just to be for form and the app to be on my phone so I'll be my own overseer• I am an adult in my country, I'm 20, going to be 21 in April. The law asks my parents to support me until I finish my studies or at least until I'm 26, but I plan on moving out sooner• I'll do gift my sister and dad, they have nothing to do with the incident and I love them lots• I love mom too but can't put up with her attitude any longer• Regarding what I'll give her, not sure yet but there are some amazing ideas in the comments• She didn't react like that because she got me the tablet already, it's not her character to get me something she can't use. • Regarding the gift dad's planning on and which she'll claim is from both of them, dad is going to build a bigger enclosure for my lizard. • I may wrap my lizard's old branches nice and gift those to mom, as per Christmas traditions regarding naughty kids. And she doesn't like my scaly boy at all so double points I guess• People saying that a drawing tablet is useless, thanks for your input but the question was if I was an A for the way I reacted and my decision to not give her a gift anymore. As it's my money I literary can do whatever I wish with it and a display drawing tablet is incredible useful for an aspiring digital artist as myself.Thank you all who commented, I'll really try to reply to you all but you're so many! Thank you lots!Edit number I lost count: Glad so many people like the bread shadow! It's a regional Romanian idiom! Would you eat some beans for us on 1st Dec? It's our national day, traditionally celebrated by eating beans with meat but if you're not okay with the meat that's okay too. I love you all!"
402,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my step-daughter to “go ask her real dad” when she asked me to pay for her plane tickets?,22531,irxyza,1957,"I married my wife Elise 12 years ago. She has a 16 year old daughter (Ana) from her previous relationship and we have a 7 year old son as well. From pretty much the beginning of our relationship, Ana and I have never gotten along. I don’t know how to emphasize that it is NOT because of a lack of trying. She just does not like me. When she was young she was just scared of me and “afraid I’d tear their family apart”. Nowadays it’s more of a neutral dislike rather than strong antipathy so I suppose that’s progressElise is a stay at home mother, so she relies on me for income. As a result, I pay for everything for Ana. Food. Clothes. Volleyball fees. Field trips. I take an interest in her hobbies. I go to her games. I’m not saying I’m perfect but I try my damn hardest to be the step-father I can. But it’s so... hard. Always giving me curt 1-word responses. Always having to have an attitude. She does things to get a rise out of me. Staying out late reeking of booze. Always trying to sneak boys in. Typical rebellious stuff. But I always let her know I love her and I’m there for her in hopes of her “shithead teenager” phase pasts. The opposite is true for her biological father. She adores him. Can’t tell you why. He never goes to her games, always makes excuses for why he doesn’t want to see her. He forgot her birthday last month and she cried herself to sleep. Well anyways, Friday, I came to her room to check her phone and read her messages (not a permanent thing, but she’s been caught sneaking out twice in the last month so this is her punishment). I ask for the phone, she says “no, I’m tired of you checking my shit, leave me alone”. I tell her I’m not asking again and she goes “just fuck off already. You’re not my real dad. You never have been. Stop acting like you can tell me what to do” before getting up and slamming the door. Like I said guys. I’m tired. Tired of the blantant disrespect. Of being the verbal punching bag while still providing more for her than anyone else in her family. We haven’t really talked since until this morning during breakfast. She asked if I could pay for her plane tickets so she could see her boyfriend cross-state. Like I said, her mom doesn’t work and her dad is a POS so I normally would be the one to cough up the money. Not this time. I responded “go ask your real dad”. I could tell she was hurt. Tears swelled up from her face and she excused herself from the table. My wife took me aside later and said my comment was extremely disrespectful. I said if anything’s disrespectful, it’s her treating me like a doormat and a credit card, and I will no longer tolerate this treatment in my house. I told her we don’t have to be friends, but if she can’t at least be cordial to me or respect my position as an authority figure, she can find someone else to pay for her non-essentials. AITA?EDIT: Just adding a TLDR at the request of a comment. My step-daughter continuously disrepects me and my authority. She told me that “I’m not her real dad”. Later on, she asked me to buy her tickets and I told her to “go ask her real dad”. AITA?And to add more context, my wife is a saint. She DOES stick up for me when Ana says something rude or snarky. She just said “stooping to her level” was inappropriate. But she’s a wonderful mom and tries her best."
403,Not the A-hole,AITA for not changing my rules and terminating care?,22526,l7jgck,2344,"I have a home daycare. I like to think I’m pretty lenient but I do have one big rule: Don’t make me the bad guy. I understand we might have different rules but don’t make your child resent me by not backing me up.Anyway, another rule is I don’t allow outside toys or electronics. Kids can bring a stuffed animals for nap if they’re sleeping on rest mats but I don’t want to be responsible if something gets broken. Years ago, I used to let kids bring whatever. Then a cheap McDonalds toy broke by accident, kid was upset and mom got mad at me. So now it’s a hard rule.Most are okay with it. But I have a new kid (3) who’s mom wanted him to bring his tablet because “he needs it”. I said sorry but no. I’m not going to be responsible for it. We went back and forth but finally she just says fine. But every morning, he’s crying because she took his tablet from him in the car. She always gives me this look and says “Miss Lucy says no tablet.” I always try to say we have plenty of toys, but the kids spends the whole morning sulking. I’ve talked to mom, asked her to leave it at home and not even put it in the car but she says he “needs it”.It’s been a month and yesterday was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Kid came in crying as usual. I tried my usual redirection which didn’t work. Mom was giving me a look of “see what you did”. Then she had the nerve to say to him “I know you need your tablet, we’ve talked about this before, Miss Lucy is strict”. That pissed me off. I ended up telling her to take him home right then and there. She was shocked and tried to stammer. He was my first kid of the day so there was no scene. I just handed back his backpack, said he was no longer a student of mine and began to pack his extra clothes and the sippy cup he kept. Mom was in tears as she left.My husband thinks she was right. I’m too strict and should’ve broken policy instead of causing drama. AITA?Edit: There was no medical need for the tablet. It was all just that he wanted it.Edit 2: I’m not making a waiver for electronics. That won’t stop other issues with the tablets, such as jealousy and drama.Edit 3: Who reported to Reddit Care that you think I’m suicidal?? Where did you get that?Edit 4: So my “don’t make me the bad guy rule” has been misunderstood, partly as I worded it poorly. I don’t expect blind obedience. No one has to agree with my rules. They can challenge them, to me. But to their kid, I’d rather them explain everyone has different rules and that while they’re with me, things will be different.I do the same with parents who have different rules than mine. I never say they’re wrong or strict, I say that we have different rules at school and to listen to mom and dad.This is also a policy for pacifiers, bottles and potty training. I’ll approach any of these milestones when you ask, but you have to be working on it at home too. The kid won’t progress if they only go pee on the potty at home.And the child was not autistic or non verbal. If he was, an exception would be made.I accept I’m TA for terminating with no notice. That wasn’t right.Final update/edit: I returned her money for the last few days of January and texted an apology for terminating without notice and said I hope she was able to find care. She said she left him at her mom’s. She also asked if there was anyway I’d reconsider and I said no. We had a long phone call and no minds were changed, but it was the ending we SHOULD have had."
404,Not the A-hole,AITA for withholding from my children that my husband had a wife and child before he met me? They’ve just found out and are acting like I’ve betrayed them.,22505,c879l2,3211,"My children are 17 and 14 respectively, and I’m hoping the fact that they’re teenagers is the reason for their incredibly shitty behavior. My husband, before he met me, had a wife and a newborn baby that passed away in Canada due to hazardous road conditions that resulted  in a 4 car smash up. No one was at fault, it was a horrific disaster, and my husband was devastated as a result and fell into alcoholism to cope. I had my own trauma from the past, and similarly turned to alcoholism to cope. It was at an AA meeting where we met, 20 years ago almost to the day now, and we slowly started to heal together here in the US. I have always been incredibly respectful of my husbands last wife and child. I like to joke that I’m keeping her seat warm until my husband enters heaven. I’ve had too much loss and hurt in my life to feel jealousy like this, and tbh- I am so damaged that I just feel lucky that I got to actually feel love in this world and that my husband could open his beautiful heart to me. We had two children- two sons. We’d never told them about my husbands wife or baby, because it’s a part of my husbands life that he keeps under lock and key. He has never healed from his grief, and therapy etc has helped him only to a degree. My mother in law told the kids this Sunday gone, as she decided it was ‘time for them to know’. She didn’t consult us before telling them, and certainly didn’t do it in our presence. Since then my sons have been making the most disgusting dead baby jokes, they’ve been prodding their dad asking why we’d never told them, and instead of approaching the topic with respect they’re acting like we’ve kept a secret affair family from them or something. My 14 y/o went on to say to me in private, thank goodness not in front of his father, that he was glad my husbands previous family was dead. I broke and yelled at him, and told him it was the most disgusting thing I’d ever heard him say. I asked where his anger was coming from, and he burst forth that we were shitty parents for keeping secrets. He told me that it made ‘so much sense’ why we were abnormal, why we don’t drink, why we are so boring and quiet, why my husband is panicky around roads, etc. the two are pretty heartbroken, and I feel like we have just destroyed a part of our children’s lives as a result of us staying quiet. I am hurting, my husband is grieving all over again, and I don’t know how to proceed. I have and will always reiterate to our kids that they are loved, but this behavior seems so overreactive for the news."
405,Not the A-hole,AITA for rejecting a disabled girl's prom asking?,22504,f7l1s5,2047,"Alright so today was quite traumatic for me. I'm a high school senior (18M) and promposal season is currently in full swing. I was in my AP chem class when suddenly an entourage of people entered my classroom with a disabled girl (she has cerebral palsy) that I know. I first saw the posters and the bouquet of flowers she was holding and thought, ""aww that's sweet of her."" Then they revealed the posters and I read my name and was completely taken aback. I literally almost had a fucking anxiety attack. I didn't know what to say at all and the entire class was cheering and people even started filming. I was straight up frozen for a minute and I could feel myself burning up with embarrassment. Of course I wanted to say no, but since it was so public and everyone was waiting for me to say yes, I did and hugged her. Everyone clapped including the teacher and I was mortified. One of my buddies asked me if I was okay afterwards since apparently I looked like I was gonna burst into tears and I told him I literally did not expect that at all and I didn't want to say yes. He suggested that I go find her after school or something and explain that to her and I agreed. Now, this girl is really  nice. We had a class together last year and sat next to each other for a majority of it and talked quite a lot. I would say we were friends then, but we haven't spoken more than two times this school year so we've definitely drifted apart. That's why I was completely shocked when she sprung the prom asking on me usually, people have their friends make sure that the other is at least aware before doing the asking to prevent situations like this. I was contemplating if I should just bite the bullet and go with her, but decided I just couldn't because it is my senior year prom and I was already starting to plan my asking. There's this girl that I've liked for a couple of months now and I recently heard from my friends that she likes me back so I was gonna ask her. So I ended up going to the special ed classroom after school where I found her and asked if I could speak to her outside. I told her everything and how I really, really appreciated the gesture, but I was already planning on asking my crush to prom and she was CRUSHED. She started crying really loudly and asked me why I couldn't of just said no and I said that I didn't want to embarrass the two of us in front of all those people. At this point, one of her aids came out to check on us since she could hear the crying and the girl told her aid what happened and she straight up glared at me and said, ""That's not okay."" Now I feel like absolute shit. AITA?"
406,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my parents to stop hooking me up with single girls from their church? AITA for not wanting to get married?,22473,gnugc5,1329,"The last year and a half has been hard for me, to say the least.Last March, my brilliant and hilarious and beautiful girlfriend Natalie suddenly passed away.  Everyone always gave shit about us because of politics.  We met in college when were were poly sci majors: she is very liberal (think AOC) and I'm pretty conservative.  We actually met because we were serving as treasurers for our school's College Democrats and Young Republicans clubs, respectively, and our groups would get together for drinks or bowling or laser tag once a month.  Well, Natalie and I bonded over a lot of shared interests and we hit it off.  Even if we didn't see eye to eye on many issues, debating her was stimulating and formed the cornerstone of our relationship.  We've had debates that went on until dawn.  We just bounced off each other.  She liked to joke that we were ""drift compatible"".  I wanted to marry this woman, but she passed away before we got a chance to talk about marriage.  I'm in therapy and I'm working through working through not having her in my life anymore, but it's been rough.  Then 'Rona happened and I got laid off, so I had to move back in with my parents and figure out what I am supposed to do now.My parents mean well, but they got married really young and are more conservative and religious than me.  They've been trying to set me up on dates with single girls from their church since I moved back home.  But I don't want to date these girls.No offense to them, but it's a small town in the American Breadbasket.  They don't share the same interests as me and it feels like their only goal in life is to be a good Christian wife and produce a lot of babies.  Trying to talk to them about current events is excruciating for me.  The girls my parents tried to set me up with take everything they read on Facebook or hear from Fox News for face value.  It makes me miss Natalie and our debates more. My parents mean well.  I know they want me to find a nice girl and settle down with her, but not like this.  They are nothing like Natalie and never will be.  I miss her, even if my folks didn't like her ideas.  But when I told them the other night that I wanted them to stop setting me up on dates with these girls, they freaked out and told me that I needed to consider settling down since I just turned thirty.  They're good girls from great families, I know that, and my parents like them more than they liked Natalie, but she was my one and only.  I don't think it's fair for anyone when I still love her.  They are even more angry at me because I told them that I just don't see myself getting married anytime soon.  But like I said, Natalie was my soulmate and I just can't see myself being with anyone else but her.  Yet, they are insisting that I need to find a woman and settle down and give them grandchildren.Edit:  We were seriously close to talking about marriage.  But around the time she died, it was more like how funny it would be if the bridal party wore blue and the groomsmen wore red because the bride is a Democrat and the groom is a Republican/Romeo and Juliet deal.Fuck, I wish we got to do that.  Natalie thought it was hilarious.Edit of the edit:  Sweet Disney's ghost!  I am ashamed to admit this, but I broke down when I saw all of your responses.  Thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart.  You are all great and wonderful people and God will reward you for your kindness.  Your support is overwhelming.  I haven't felt this supported in a very, very long time.  I am reading all of your comments.  Thank you, thank you so much.  I've been feeling so lost for a long time, and with the virus it has been sending me into a tailspin.  I am saving this post so when I feel dark, I can come here and read your comments and I know that even though we are strangers, we have each others backs.  And in this day and age, we need it even more than ever.  God bless you all!"
407,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my morbidly obese 10 year old sister to eat healthier?,22456,bduq2d,2621,"So I'm 17 and I used to be morbidly obese. I was actually morbidly obese until last year when I decided to stop eating my parents food and make my own. I'm now at a normal healthy weight, going to the gym everyday and trying to build musey and I feel really great. I went from 130kg to 70kg and I'm 5ft 9Anyways my sister eats horribly. She is morbidly obese. My parents always buy her huge bags of sweets (in which she eats all of it), she eats an entire pizza for dinner, eats a huge Doritos share bag all by herself, is practically allergic to water, burgers and oily drenched chips is a tradition in our house too Anyways I saw her eating 5 white bread grilled cheese sandwhiches fried in a pan filled with butter. The sandwhiches were practically soaked with oily butter and with 2 packets of crisps on the side. My mother made it for her. 5 sandwhiches. It's absolutely insane I think And there was nice coke can to go with it. I told my sister that she could at least substitute the coke for water and that the volume of food was too much. I offered her a Piece of tofu in which I was having for lunch. Tofu is actually delicious. More people should try it. She told my mother and my mother screamed at me and told me that I'm ruining her childhood and that nobody told me to eat healthy when I was a child(I wish someone did). Apparently eating junk and being huge is a good childhood. My mother said I wad being extremely offensive and that she might now not let me go off with my friends next week anymore for camping.Was I in the wrong?"
408,Not the A-hole,"AITA for ""dramatically"" running away from an intervention my MIL threw for me?",22437,k7evv4,2999,"Husband (28m) and I (28f) live in Colorado. We love beer, and we live an active lifestyle (hiking, snowshoeing, skiing). No beer hits like a beer after climbing a 14er, and I love a glass of wine in the bath on a lazy Sunday afternoon.My MIL loves to clean her kids' houses as a gift quarterly. This works because we're notoriously lazy ""deep"" cleaners. This is important.A week ago, she asked to meet her at the park. I showed up to find a (bizarrely socially distant) group of my in-laws waiting for me with a box. She started, saying ""Kaylie, this is an intervention. We're here because we love you,"" etc. It was awkward and I got nervous. She opened the box and showed three empty bottles of wine and two full bottles of wine, plus an empty 16oz beer can.She looked at me pityingly and said ""Sweetie, I found your stash. I know you have a drinking problem.""I was caught off guard and looked at the pile and it *clicked*. A few months ago the bathroom sink backed up and we were rushing around trying to clear things for the plumbers to take care of it. I must have shoved my empty wine bottles and a shower beer can in my closet. The full bottles *were* purposely hidden, because they were going to be Christmas gifts for my husband.I tried explaining everything and she put her hand on my shoulder and said ""I know it's hard to accept you have a problem, but everyone here is here because we love you.""Look. I drink a beer with dinner or after work a few times a week, a beer or two at a brewery (not lately, obv) with friends, and occasionally have some wine while taking a bath. I haven't even had a hangover since college.THEN she smashed the wine bottles that were for my husband, saying it's for my own good! I started yelling at her that they were presents, she just looked me in the eye and did it again.So I ran back to our house sobbing. She called/left messages saying I can't hide from my Problem, and that she would be talking to my Husband about sending me away for detox. She was tired of me hurting everyone by forcing my choices on everyone (ie, not giving her grandkids, the one sore spot between us I thought she'd gotten over).She didn't explain to my husband what the ""stash"" was, just that she found one, and he turned on me for running away from the ""intervention"" saying that made me look guilty as hell.I felt so alone. The issue became that I ""made myself seem guilty"" by running. My husband understands what happened now but he's told me that I need to find a way to put it all behind and maybe just not drink around his family for a while. I don't agree. I'm not going along with this. Fine, I won't drink around his family, but I'm not apologizing for running away when I felt scared and cornered, and I'm absolutely *NOT* copping to a drinking problem when I *DON'T HAVE ONE!!!* AITA for not just going along with this to make everyone happy?!? I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING CRAZY.ETA: Holy moly I posted this when I was stressed to the max and then went for an 8-mile run to try to shake it off. I'm crying reading all of this because with everyone telling me how bad I was, I was so scared that I did something horrible. I'm reading every comment so everyone knows. I'll try to respond to some. Thank you so much for the votes. Even the ones telling me what I did wrong. Thank you, just... thank you.ETA 2: Sorry but I felt I needed to update saying that some guy ""AskGoblins"" from a channel called ""Ask Goblin"" sent me a chat to ask me for permission to use it for his YouTube channel. I mean the guy can do whatever he wants but I think this is a low level way of scraping money from people who post here to exploit them and it felt wrong that he chatted me and didn't comment. Also his account has no comments or posts.ETA 3: Omg I never thought I'd have to address the concept of a shower beer. Maybe this is a Colorado thing but when you have a long, active day climbing or hiking or snowshoeing or whatever the best reward is cracking a cold one in a hot shower or bath. It's not weird lol most of the people I know do it."
409,Not the A-hole,AITA for being angry at my family for lying about my birth parents race,22420,hmyyq4,1174,"I’m 23M. I’ve known I was adopted all along. For whatever reason I became obsessed with learning more about my birth parents at age 13. I was told all my life that my parents met both of my birth parents before I was officially adopted. My mom was white from South America and my dad was white from Italy. They specified these two locations to explain why I had tan skin.As I was growing up certain things about my physical makeup made me more curious about my birth parents. My hair was kept short as a kid but as a teen I wanted to experiment. I grew it out and it grew out curly. Big curls but still curly. This upset my parents so they asked that I not grow it out. When I moved away for college I began to let it grow again. I met my girlfriend in school. She is Black American so she also helped me care for it. She once braided my hair before I FaceTimed my parents who lost it on me for wearing it that way. Throughout my time in school I still searched for my birth mom but would always come up empty. My girlfriend hinted that there must’ve been a mistake with the information, even down to the name my parents claimed I had before they adopted me. She gifted me a DNA kit on my birthday that I didn’t get around to until the lockdown hit. I didn’t think anything would come of it because my parents weren’t American so I didn’t know if it would work that way. So I sent it out of boredom and got my results weeks later which have changed everything.I’m Black and Middle Eastern. I have light skin and my curl pattern is so loose that I hadn’t considered it a sign before. I have ancestral ties to Iran which can explain a more “European” facial structure. I’m sorry for my wording, I’m still learning. I sent my gf a screenshot and she called me right away. We were both stunned though she long suspected. I tried to believe that my parents were innocently misinformed but my girlfriend kept pointing out the inconsistencies. My parents claimed to have met my birth parents therefore they couldn’t have mistaken them for white. I confronted my parents who became enraged at me for doing a DNA kit. I was very angry, yelling, swearing. They robbed me of my identity and hindered my search with their lies. My mom told me through tears that my racial background comes with a stigma. That I passed so she wanted me to have an easier life fitting in. My dad yelled at me that I had to abandon what I just learned. I rage broke my phone and left. My siblings have been hitting me up on social media reprimanding me for being upset because our parents reasoning is sound. I do pass, I did have an easy life. I’m not asking to be part of a struggle all of a sudden. I just don’t think I should’ve been lied to and I think they’re reasoning is bullshit and racist. I’m just supposed to act like 10 years of me searching with the wrong info isn’t that big of a deal?Edit: There’s no way I can respond to all of you. Some answers:DNA kits can be wrong/Parents can be White South Africans:My parents admit that my mom was black. My oldest sister also recalls seeing my mom at some point. Both verify that she was black. Yes they could be lying again. I have plans to continue to look into my background.YTA for having a temper/breaking your phone:Okay, that’s fair. Someone was shocked that I could break my phone. I threw it. I didn’t break it with my bare hands. I walked out and threw it out of anger and it shattered. How do your parents treat your girlfriend:They tried to treat her poorly. They were okay at first but eventually some comments were made that caused me to put some distance between us. My girlfriend was very hurt by their statements so I chose to keep us both away from them. Claims that I’m race baiting: I don’t understand how. I’m angry about being lied to and how that lie has made my effort into finding my birth parents completely void while also rewriting my heritage. You likely didn’t pass to other POC: That’s my girlfriends stance as well. I’m tan enough that going to an all white school still got me called slurs. Whatever issues my parents were trying to shield me from it didn’t work. Maybe this is a lie that I bought into alone.The current state of my relationship with my family:It’s chaos. Two of my siblings are trying to be supportive. I deactivated my Facebook and unfollowed some people on Instagram. I can’t entertain the argument that I should forgive my parents and move on. I’m not there yet. I get that it makes me ungrateful for feeling this way.For those who asked about my hair lol. They are big curls? My girlfriend says they are 2c/3a. My hair texture is not unique to any race group but drastically different from my family’s. For those of you who are pming me slurs and telling me to go back to my shit hole country, thanks a lot. I appreciate your support. I appreciate those of you who shared your personal experiences with adoption and race with me, for giving me resources, books, and documentary suggestions, for welcoming me into your groups and giving me some kind words. I’m overwhelmed by your support. I’ve written down a lot of those recommendations. I’m still reading everything you guys have written as well. I appreciate the kind comments about my parents as well. I don’t hate them, I’m just really upset and disappointed in their decisions."
410,Not the A-hole,AITA For keeping my promise of training her kids like dogs if/when my cousin dumps them on me?,22410,jvie9q,2386,"I'm sorry if the title isn't accurate, I can't think of another description to describe the ""training"".My cousin Amy (25F) has (6M) twins and has a nasty habit of dumping them onto relatives to babysit for the entire day without any warning or regard for their time. I (27F) have a very strained relationship with her but because my mom's side of the family demands that we all remain close-knit, so I have no choice to tolerate her.When she initially gave birth to them, she teased me that I'll have to take on babysitting duty from now on. I'm no good with kids, so I remarked to her that if I ever have them, I'll train them, not babysit. She brushed me off.The kids now are hella destructive and loud. Pulling out stuffing inside furniture, holes inside walls, smashing anything glass and porcelain, screaming louder than a fire alarm, you name it. When it was my first turn to deal with them, I immediately walked with them to the store and grabbed the biggest bag of M&M's I could find and trained them so that every time they follow my orders and behave, they get one. If they misbehave, I get one.Soon enough, every time the kids were dumped on me, they went with my guidelines and behaved. Whenever I say sit, they sit at the table. When I say stay, they don't leave that spot, etc.Two days ago there was a party planned with the whole extended family (I know, pandemic. Didn't want to, but mom insisted) and I grabbed the M&M's since the twins were there. Arrived, twins were being so destructive (an entire tray of food was spilled) that all the adults had enough and yelled at Amy to control them. She vomited the same excuse of them just being kids and they'll grow out of it eventually.I shouted the twins' names and shook my M&M bag. They came running over to me and I popped 6  pieces into my mouth for their misbehavior. I told them to go clean up the mess or no candy all night. They do so.Halfway through the party, every time something similar came up or they just weren't behaving, I was the one able to calm them down. When Amy saw what I was doing, she got angry and started yelling at me about how her children aren't animals and that I shouldn't be giving them so much candy anyway. I told her that I'm their aunt, not their parent, why am I the one disciplining them? Isn't that her job?She screamed the same argument at me and since she's their mother, to stop giving them candy. One of the twins overheard and went apeshit. Dashed straight into the kitchen and started shattering anything they can get his hands on, shouting over and over that he wants candy. His twin joined him soon after. I repeated that she's their mother, and just sat in the living room watching it all unfold. At the end, Amy blamed me for them turning out this way. The other relatives she dumped them on (a majority) disagreed, but when I told a friend about the situation, he told me that the training I did can really fuck up the kids mentally later in life. So, AITA?"
411,Not the A-hole,AITA for “tattling” on my boyfriend to his mother,22334,azfg6o,626,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years, and things were great until our daughter was born 6 months ago.Since then, our relationship has gone down the tubes because he refuses to care for her. He’ll sit on the couch and play video games and he’ll only tend to her while she’s screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I’m in the middle of doing something right then, he’ll ask me why I can’t just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he’s watching tv and she’s calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won’t get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We’ve talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I’ve told him I can’t handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.I’m honestly considering filing for custody but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was going out. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn’t trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what’s going on.She called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he’s upset with me for involving his mother and for “taking a video out of context.” I’m at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?Edit: the pregnancy was an accident but my boyfriend wanted me to keep it."
412,Not the A-hole,AITA for donating my daughters college fund instead of giving it to my step daughter to help buy a house,22272,epmdeh,2988,"So I have a 16 year old daughter that passed away in a car accident October 19th. I’ve been collecting a college fund for her since she was young, my ex husband and I both put money into it as well as she put some of her paychecks from work into it, and it’s about $25,000 full. I recently got remarried to a man who has a 30 year old daughter. My step daughter doesn’t like me, because I’m only 3 years older than her, my husband is significantly older than I am. My daughter was very passionate about the environment, and my ex husband and I discussed what we would do with the college fund. My husband says it was my daughter and I can do what I feel is right to honor her. We decided to divide it and we would each donate to charities we felt would make our daughter proud. My step daughter however thinks we should split it evenly and she should get some cushion for buying a house, since I’m married to her father and that makes my contribution his money too. She thinks donating *essentially* $13000 wouldn’t mean anything to a big charity and I could help someone I know in real life.My husband has since joined her side and thinks $13000 would help her buy a house and we can honor my daughter in another way.AITA for not wanting to change my plans?Edit: there seems to be some confusion and I’m so sorry for  wording it poorlyMy ex husband and I, and a little bit my daughter are the sole people putting money into the fund. My current husband has not put any money into the fund from his personal finances. My step daughter and my biological daughter did not have a relationship, as my step daughter is almost twice her age. I am 33, my husband is 58. We have a joint house account, as well as separate personal funds. My step daughter has brought this up multiple times, it wasn’t just a suggestion, she constantly brings it up. My step daughter is also not poor off financially. She can afford a house, she is single, my husband helped her pay off her debt before we got married. She just wants some cushion.Edit #2: I am dividing the funds with my ex husband, not my husband now. My ex husband gets half to do with as he pleases to honor our daughter. My current husband gets nothing."
413,Not the A-hole,AITA for not apologizing to a high functioning autistic bully after calling him out?,22259,jd3l7v,1312,"I (15M) go to school with a guy I’ll call Jake. Jake has high functioning autism and is also a bully. He wont ever try on someone bigger than him (like me), but he will go after smaller guys, and seems to really like to go after the girls. He will always say he didn’t understand what he said was inappropriate and he is never held accountable by the teachers. So on Monday he was really harping on a girl I’ll call Lori. I’ve known Lori since I was six and I can say she is quiet, and keeps to herself because she’s so self conscious, because when she was little she was involved in a fire and got badly burned. He wouldn’t stop telling her how ugly she was and how she’d never get a boyfriend because no one wanted to be around something like that.  She said he was being cruel, but he still wouldn’t stop. Lori started crying, and our teacher tried to say he probably just didn’t understand what he did, and I blew up.I said it was ridiculous that everyone kept giving him a pass to bully people because they’re afraid of upsetting the autistic kid. Well I wasn’t, and there was no way he didn’t know it was inappropriate to call her ugly and continue insulting her even after she told him he was being cruel. He’s a bully, him having autism doesn’t make him any less of one and it was ridiculous to expect others to just get bullied to spare his feelings. The teacher gave us both detention and Jake is trying to play the victim, but I made it clear he was just a bully and I have no tolerance for bullies. The rest of the week, no one would talk to him or associate with him and now he’s blaming me for “ruining his life“. His mom called my mom yesterday and asked me to apologize. I won’t and now she’s upset and says I’m bullying her kid. My mom says to do what I feel is best, but my grandmother thinks it was an asshole move to call him out in front of everyone and I should be the bigger person and apologize. AITA for not apologizing?TLDR High functioning autistic kid bullies other and made a girl I know cry, I called him out and refuse to apologize for it."
414,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to change my necklace?,22222,jdoiv2,2239,"I have worn a necklace for the last ten years. My friend, who is pagan, gave it to me as a gift when we first met. This friend passed away last year. The necklace is a pentagram. I do not believe it has magic. I am agnostic. I do not believe in any religion being better than another, because I don't think any religion is right. But I keep this to myself. I just like the necklace and my friend was/is important to me. It is the only jewelry I wear.I recently met my brother (Måns) for dinner and he introduced his girlfriend Eva (early 30s). She is Christian. She believes in very many things I do not. She was very polite, but my brother told me she was uncomfortable. He said she comes from a culture where those things are evil. She does not want it in her life. I said I am not evil. I am wearing a star. It is rude. I did not ask her to take off her crucifix, which had a dead man nailed on it. Which creeps me out a little. He told me that Eva would be coming to dinner next Sunday. It would be at our parents' home. They do not believe either. Måns asked them to please talk to me. They said no. In their home I will wear what I like. They have said they would not pray either, like Måns has asked. Our sister Greta has asked Måns not to bring around someone ignorant. Måns is mad at me for not removing the necklace. I believe that it is not evil, that saying someone is evil because of a star is wrong. And I do not like his girlfriend for demanding suck things. AITA"
415,Not the A-hole,AITA For kicking my brother in law out and reporting my therapist?,22209,kk90d7,1095,"Let me explain. Even though I don't like to talk about it. I (male) 25 was involved in an auto accident (I was the one driving) and lost my dad who was with me at the time. I had untreated PTSD for nearly a year. I couldn't speak about it to anyone. My sister got me in therapy 2 months ago because she said that I needed it.This is our first holidays without dad and I wasn't intending on doing anything this year but the family decided to come and spend time with me. My aunt, my cousin and her kids, my sister and my brother in law, and my mom. My brother in law started bringing up the accident in detail exactly the way I'd describe it like he heard it from me, the number of sessions I've attended so far. Brought up the name of my therapist and asked if he's the one I been seeing. Then he started asking me how I'm doing/if my therapy sessions are benefiting me or not/and telling the exact time I got into therapy. And then casually said that I shouldn't tell people that I feel responsibility for what happened implying that I told my therapist that.I was taken aback I asked how he knew all that. My sister said she didn't tell him and I didn't tell anyone. My brother in law looked confused when he noticed how upset I was and said that it was a ""coincidence"" the therapist happens to be one of his friend's brother. He'sknown my therapist for 5 years and that's how he knew since his friend said my name sounded familiar. I was shocked. Everyone was looking at me and my aunt started talking about me ""telling everyone"" about the accident. I was so infuriated I found myself lashing out at my brother in law and he started talking about how I need to deal my anger issues disregarding that he told the entire family about my sessions. After arguing with him and listening to him blaming me for how I reacted. I ended up telling him to leave. My sister sided with him then they both left My aunt defended him and said that I shouldn't have yelled at him and hurt my sister's feelings. That he was just worried about me.I was so mad especially when they all started guilt tripping me and berating me for what I did.I sent my therapist an e--mail telling him what happened after I couldn't get a hold of himand mentioned that I will be reporting him and file a complaint against him for disclosing information without my consent. So far I haven't heard from him and What bothers me is that I'm not close with those people and hearing them gossip about me like that is not okay.My brother in law has always been like this but it never occured to me that he'd do this. The family said I ruined dinner for them and that I overreacted and was lashing out at everyone for no reason. I feel terrible. They said they gathered to comfort me and I caused a scene."
416,Not the A-hole,AITA for naming my daughter the name I chose years ago?,22200,i8jqkz,1456,"I had my daughter a week ago. I had chosen her name a long while ago because it had a very personal meaning for me. Before I was pregnant my sister and I had been talking about what we'd like to name our kids and I told her the girl name I really wanted to use. She complimented me on it and then we didn't talk about it again. She gave birth to my niece five months ago and guess what name she used? That's right. THE name I had chosen so long ago. I didn't care. Was a little annoyed by it but I wasn't going to let it stop me from using the name.Now she's annoyed I used the name too. She told me it was weird that I would use it and that the cousins have the same first, middle and last name. I told her I wasn't going to change the name I had wanted for a long time, that had a deep meaning for me, just because she decided to use it after I told her the name. She said as the first one to have a baby she got dibs. I told her to get over it and it was a name anyone could use.AITA?I don't think she's an asshole fyi. I think she's entitled to use the name. But she's kinda being assholeish when she knows how I felt about the name.Editing to add details I provided below so I it doesn't keep getting asked.My husband took my name when we got married and my sister is a single mom, hence the same name.We live 2 hours from each other.The first name was my best friends name. She died when we were 14 and I always planned to name a daughter after her to honor her. So it is very special. The middle name holds important significance due to a trauma I suffered and the healing it brought in a situation (it's a weird story I will admit and I shared more detail in reply to someone but I'm not in the mental state to write it out again).The discussion was 3ish years ago. It was the full name I mentioned.She is spelling the middle name slightly different."
417,Not the A-hole,AITA For kicking my stepbrother and his friends out after what they did at my engagement party?,22196,lennpa,1606,"I M30 have a younger step brother Kevin 22. I let him move in to my old apartment and pay cheaper rent along with his two other friends because they're struggling with college. needed a cheaper place but couldn't find. I'd help him out by getting his car fixed, lend him money, bring him meals.I take care of my mom who's at the hospital. My fiancée and I decided to have a small celebration at a restaurant. 8 people. There were a lot of people I wanted including mom but couldn't. I have high blood pressure that despite medication, gets worse.Kevin wanted to bring his friends to my engagement party. I declined and explained that we're having a small celebration. He was upset but then dropped itWe got to the restaurant. And just as we started eating. I got a call from Kevin saying he is at the hospital where mom's staying. I asked him why and he sounded worry telling me mom was very sick and that I needed to get there because it seemed like she was having a stroke. I dropped my fork. My fiancée and parents noticed how pale I was. I hung up. And I was getting ready to leave. They asked what was going on I told them mom was very sick and I needed to go to the hospital. fiancée wanted to come but I didn't take her.I got there. I went to the nurses who were handling my mom's care and they denied her having any sudden issues let alone a stroke. I couldn't stand on my feet. I called Kevin several times until he picked up. He started laughing along with the others in the background. I was confused. He told me it was a prank and that I fell for it.He said we're even since they couldn't show up to my engagement party. I started yelling at him til he hung up. my fiancée's parents were calling I felt terrible because I didn't know what to tell them. It was a prank. my fiancée's family thought I was lying I kept saying my mom's doing okay, I drove to my apartment where Kevin was staying. Got into argument with him and his buddies. I yelled at them for ruining my engagement dinner and causing me stress knowing I have high BP.I told them to pack their things and move out. Kevin started begging saying I can't do this over a prank and they had nowhere to go. I told him it wasn't my problem. They kept saying it was a prank and they didn't expect me to react like that. Then They left. My aunt called me saying Kevin was an asshole for what he did but kicking him out was extreme and I was too harsh on him. Eventually that's my brother and I need to be supportive of him even though he's acting stupid.I take some of the blame as my fiancée said because they did things before and I should've stopped them but I couldn't imagine them going this far.Kevin's mom is deceased. I help him with whatever I can because I know he's struggling. His aunt isn't my biological aunt but I respect her enough to consider her family. But defending this behavior isn't acceptable."
418,Not the A-hole,"AITA for refusing to reschedule my birthday party, “forcing” my stepbrother out of “family celebrations” because my stepmom thought I wouldn’t have a party since this isn’t a leap year?",22196,lplliu,1427,"I was born on 29th feb 2000, so I’m turning 21 in a few days. My dad got married a month ago. She has a son a few years younger than me. He’s 16. My dad is currently abroad for work, and my stepmom decided to take a little holiday out of town with stepbrother. They’re supposed to leave tomorrow, and come back on March 2nd. I know my family will throw me a small party. Apparently my grandma reached out to stepmom 2 weeks ago and asked if she’ll be attending. Stepmom freaked out. She told grandma that she didn’t know that I was having a party since there’s no feb 29th this year. Which is the weirdest logic I’ve ever heard anyone use. Do you think I only celebrate every four years? She’s angry because she’s already booked the holiday, and cancelling it would be really expensive. This would be the first family gathering (yup, my party would be the first time my close family gathers in around a year. We still need to keep it under 15 people though) and stepbrother won’t be there to enjoy etc. She asked grandma whether it could be shifted to March 3rd. Grandma called me and asked me if that would be okay. I’m not okay with that. March 3rd isn’t a weekend. The party is currently scheduled for 28th of this month, which is a Sunday so most of my aunts and uncles can make it. They can’t make it on March 3rd. I’d prefer my aunts and uncles who I’m close to vs stepmom I met for the first time last month. I told her no. Stepmom is super upset that her son won’t meet his family and they don’t know they next time there’ll be a family gathering like this. My dad is staying out of this. He has the very convenient excuse of not being in the country to ignore this argument."
419,Not the A-hole,AITA for denying water to a group of women who were supposedly dehydrated as they refused to pay?,22193,cir8t6,4217,"A very popular hiking trail actually crosses my (privately owned) land that is nestled inside a national park. I’ve never objected to people crossing our land as I’m an avid hiker and don’t want to deny them enjoying the scenery, though it can get annoying at times when groups of 10+ people litter on my part of the trail.Anyway, a few years ago my daughter decided to set up a small stop to sell cold drinks and snacks on the trail. It’s basically a caravan she lives in, but with an attached section to serve drinks and food. So she’ll spend her time in there and every now and then people will pass by and happily top up (it’s a multi day hike). It made a surprisingly large amount of money, and so we began taking turns spending time in the caravan on the off chance someone (or a hiking group) passes by.Now, we live in a place that gets very humid in summer. It “feels like” 40-45 degrees Celsius during June-July. Today i was watching a movie in said caravan when a group of 5 girls rung the bell. They said they were out of water and asked if I could refill their water bottles. I told them I could for 50cents a bottle. The reason we charge money is that all of our water is rainwater and hence limited (especially in summer). We aren’t connected to an endless supply of water.They were furious that I refused to top them up for free and said they are dehydrating and could faint from heat stroke. I told them where a clean creek was about 1hr down the trail that they could top up (I’ve drunk from there countless times, seriously no risk) but they refused and insisted I top them up. They had a young girl with them (around 13) while the rest were in their early 20s. So I refilled the young girl’s bottle and gave her a sprite for free, but insisted the adult women with her pay. They refused and very angrily went on their way. My wife says I should have filled them up, but IMO so long as the little girl is okay I don’t think they deserved anything given their attitude."
420,Not the A-hole,"AITA for talking frankly about my abortion, when my coworker was making some wild generalizations about what abortions are like?",22147,epa98w,724,"I was in the break room at work and my coworker Arthur who tends to talk a lot about politics... Got to talking about politics. It was me, my coworker John who I'm good friends with, Adam who I don't know too well, and Arthur in the room. I was kinda sitting back from the discussion because I wanted to chill and eat lunch.But it kind of annoyed me that Arthur was making comments about women getting abortions without knowing what they're getting into, making impulse decisions because they're scared of Parenthood. As if this is a big thing that happens often.I spoke up and said I didn't think it was like that our state has mandatory counseling and meetings to make sure the person is giving informed consent. And I didn't think anyone was going about it willy nilly without knowing what they were doing.He got kind of blustery, saying ""how do you know that they don't just rush you through that, tick a few boxes?""I said that when I'd had mine, I had a very practical and informative counseling session that gave me a lot of information on my options, what I'd expect from the procedure, what my specific risks of continuing with a pregnancy would be, due to a medical condition of mine. And I didn't feel at all like I was doing something I didn't understand.It was really awkwardly silent for a bit. Arthur told me that wasn't appropriate for me to have said at work, and it's something I ought to keep quieter. I bit back the childish urge to comment that he started it. Later, John, my friend from work said he thought it was funny, how I threw Arthur's assumptions in his face, but he thinks I ought to be a little more careful because Arthur is probably gonna think differently of me now. I don't feel ashamed to talk about it, but I do see how it was a lot to say at work...AITA for talking frankly about my abortion?"
421,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting 3 co-workers fired for making a hot list?,22133,dymoaw,1781,"A bunch of people from my department at work went for drinks on Friday after work. Everyone was having a good time and there were about 20 of us there (from about 30 people in our department). I go to the bathroom, and as I am about to exit the hall to the bathroom I hear my co-worker say my name from around the corner of the wall. Perhaps I shouldn't have eavesdropped, but curiosity/suspicion got the best of me and I did.I overheard a conversation of three guys in my department making a ""hot list"" (they actually referred to it as that), which involved ranking every woman in the department from first to last. I was upset and disturbed. I was quite friendly with 2/3 of the guys, actually. Yesterday morning I tell HR and they state that they have a zero-tolerance policy for actions like this. All three men were fired first thing this morning, and now I feel terrible.I hated the way they were talking about women, but I didn't think they should be fired. With that said, we work for a large company that I know takes complaints like this seriously, and would not really miss these 3 guys, so deep down I suppose I knew it was a possibility when I complained. Nobody knows that I am the person who reported them, and I've overheard people say that the person is a ""snitch"". I'm wondering if I should have just confronted them at the bar and told them how it made me feel instead, but at the time I didn't feel comfortable doing that. I especially feel bad because I had a fairly good relationship with two of the guys.AITA?INFO 1: It was not a formal work event, but our supervisor organized everyone going out for drinksINFO 2: A lot of people are insisting that I am upset because I was low on the list. I tried to avoid making this the focus, but with all the comments I feel like I have to address it. I was high on the list, and was not offended about my placement I was offended about the fact that they were making a list in the first place. I hate that I even have to write this**ETA: wow this is just about the most toxic thing that has ever happened to me. I came here for judgment on whether I am an asshole in this situation, and I have gotten numerous personal messages calling me ugly, a bitch, fat, a nazi, psycho, etc. I really think something needs to be done about this sub, although admittedly I'm not sure what, because I can't believe this is the response for somebody using this sub for its intended purpose**update: I will be speaking to HR about the messages I received"
422,Not the A-hole,AITA For reporting my therapist after she disclosed information to my stepmom?,22131,l4rmkt,1810,"I (20f) lost my mom in 2018 in a car accident. It was sudden it was devastating and I had no one to turn to for support. My dad married my stepmom a year later. I currently live with them preparing for medical school. I have to say I'm not that excited to start because I have a lot of unresolved grief and needed to talk. My stepmom has been trying to insert herself as a replacement for my mom mad it's very obvious. She's controlling and gets involved in every single aspect of my life it makes me uncomfortable. I told my dad that I'll be seeing a therapist my stepmom said she'd take care of it. I have been in therapy for two months now. However lately I noticed my stepmom wanting to talk to me about things that I regularly bring up in therapy to my therapist. She'd bluntly ask questions about things I said in therapy she at some point offered me money to talk to her. I stopped talking to her. But she started brining up my mom during dinner It's not easy to talk about my mom. It's very stressful and causes me to get emotional. When I asked how she knew she admitted that the therapist told her. I was shocked. She went on about why I shouldn't hate her and respect her more and ""get rid"" of the negativity and just accept and try to adapt to this new normal. I had no response but I was mad I yelled at her and told her she had no right to police my words and get involved in personal manners. My dad said I shouldn't yell because my stepmom was just worried about me and wanted to make sure I was making progress in therapy. I left the kitchen. I decided to stop seeing my therapist the next day I told her about what my stepmom said and told her that I'll be reporting her for breaking confidentiality.My stepmom threw a fit and my dad told me to back down and that I was free to stop going but not cause issues and mess with people's careers and act out like that.I refused to listen to him and he's still telling me to stop it. He ignores how upset I am."
423,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my sister that her husband was bullshitting her?,22123,h8aqon,893,"**Edit**: I got overwhelmed trying to respond to comments, but thanks a ton to everyone who commented!To people asking whether my in-laws are really named Jake and Leah — no, it comes from a bible story, and I thought I’d be clever with the aliases. To people asking why I haven’t intervened before in my sister’s relationship — I’ve tried to gently bring it up, but I was worried about hurting her or being wrong. My partner and I are currently stuck in my home state due to COVID, but I actually have a job in another country that I’ll be returning to once the pandemic ends. I haven’t been around my sister too much in the past year, but I did try to call her a few times a week before I moved back. Finally, to the people calling my sister stupid — she is not. Please have a little empathy, the idea that your husband might be cheating can be hard to face.This is a wild situation. To give some background, I (32F) have a sister “Leah” (26F). She’s been married to “Jake” for five years, and they have two kids. We all grew up very Christian, I ended up leaving the church, but my sis and BIL are still on fire Christians.Anyway, Leah has mentioned things to me that seem very sketchy. I think Jake is cheating, but she won’t accept the thought. He leaves their bed at night and doesn’t come back til after work the next day, he hides money, and he’s trying not to conceive another kid with my sister. I’ve gently tried to give her a reality check, but it hasn’t worked.Well, on Friday after work they came over to swim (totally fine in our state). Jake was swimming with the kids, and my sister and I were sitting in the grass keeping an extra eye on them. Jake had lots of red scratches on his back, to me they looked like fingernails. I made a joke to my sister about their dry spell being over, and she said they still hadn’t had sex in a year. I gently told her that they looked like finger marks, and that it was sketchy as hell. She said casually that Jake had gone on a “prayer walk” with his men’s group and had been spiritually attacked by a demon. Now, we grew up with these kinds of beliefs, but I told her that was crazy and just an excuse. She got really flustered and pulled her kids out of the pool. She told Jake she had a headache, and they left. AITA for telling my sister my concerns? Should I have stayed out of her business?"
424,Not the A-hole,AITA for using home security cameras to expose my girlfriend’s gaslighting?,22116,fv0x9z,2691,"My GF Anne (25F) and I (25M) have been dating the past 5 years, since college. After graduation, we were semi-long distance, living close enough that we alternately visited almost every weekend. In 2018, Anne got a job in my city, and we found a place and moved in together.Now’s a good time to mention the security cameras in our house: break-ins are unfortunately common where we live. We thus got some motion activated cameras, one of which has a view of our kitchen (to monitor the back door). The cameras only record when there’s motion so they can retain footage for a very long time. Anne of course knows this.About a year ago, Anne started complaining I wasn’t contributing equally to chores. I’ve been obsessive about chores my whole life growing up, not doing the dishes meant no videogames for a week. When I lived with roommates, I was always the chore Nazi, making damn sure we all stuck to our chore wheel. Anne is just as fastidious about chores, so we just naturally alternated who did what.I’d just been brushing her remarks off, but over the last few months they’ve become much more aggressive, e.g. I was vacuuming and Anne said “look at you finally cleaning up around here!” I replied that we alternated vacuuming, to which she retorted “no, you’ve vacuumed maybe twice since I moved in.” Exchanges like this have been happening so frequently that I began to doubt my own recollection am I not as clean as I thought?Finally, she exploded at me last week. She said that having to stay home constantly over the past weeks exposed how little I do around the house, and that she didn’t move in just to be my maid. Questioning my own sanity, I spent a few hours going through the entire 1.5 year archive of security camera footage, and tallied the exact number of times the kitchen cam caught each of us doing dishes. Our cleaning supplies (vacuum/mop/etc.) are in the kitchen pantry, so I also tallied up how many times we grabbed cleaning stuff.To my vindication, the tally showed that we indeed split chores equally. She vacuumed/mopped \~5 more times than I did I did dishes \~20 more times than she did. Given that we vacuum/mop at least once a week and do dishes at least every day, these are insignificant differences over the year and a half we’ve lived together.When I confronted Anne, she shrugged off her behavior as “remembering things differently,” but the real sin here was what *I* did, which she called an “unforgivable violation of *her* privacy,” akin to abusive stalking. She has broken up with me and is trying to move out, although obviously this is difficult due to current circumstances.I’m totally heartbroken - Anne was the love of my life and I can’t believe she destroyed our relationship like this. To make matters worse, she told many of our friends, who are mostly siding with her! They’ve been texting me that what I did was creepy, abusive, controlling, invasive, etc. I’m at a loss I’m beginning to think I’m the one who’s off base here.Edit: some people thought I vacuumed ""5x more"" and she did dishes ""20x more,"" I clarified the wording that it was literally 5 _more times_/20 _more times_, total, over 1.5 years."
425,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my sister to leave after she tried to kick me out of my own house?,22119,kiezhv,1241,"My (26F) sister, who I’ll call Emily moved in with her husband (29M), who I’ll call Roger two years back. Emily and I were never very close, but we were family nonetheless. Recently, they decided to get their house renovated and because it’s been quite disastrous at their place, they asked if they could move in with me last week, I was a little shocked because we haven’t spoken in a while but I said it would be fine with me.Emily wanted to have a talk-She asked if her and Roger could have the place to themselves on Christmas Day and Christmas Eve. I asked where she thinks I can go, her response? “I don’t know, get a motel.” She continued to tell me how I can afford a couple days in a motel and it won’t kill me. She told me it’s nothing against me, it’s just that they have their own traditions and like to spend the holiday together. They chose to get their house renovated during this time, KNOWING it would interfere with their Christmas traditions. So, I asked them to leave. I can’t put my life on hold and move out because they want to spend the holiday with each other. They won’t be homeless, my parents took them in but they called me absolutely infuriated because I refused to let them stay, and wouldn’t let them enjoy the holiday after all the trouble they went through with the renovations. AITA?EDIT: thank you for the awards and support! I keep seeing the “how could you be an asshole” comment, I understand it, but my entire family did turn against me, that sort of thing messes with your head. Thank you nonetheless for all of your help."
426,Not the A-hole,AITA for yelling at my sister in law?,22044,cb10pv,1491,"Context here: I'm an ex heroin addict. The why and how isn't important, but I got hooked at 15, tried to get clean at 17 but relapsed hard, finally got my act together and got off it for good at 21. I'm 26 now and completely clean. I don't even drink, except for on special occasions where I'll have two or three drinks at most.Now, my older brother and his wife have been together since shortly before I had my bad relapse, and she's convinced that I'm just a ticking time bomb waiting to relapse again. The first year or so, I understood her concerns and she wasn't the only person who had them. However, it's been almost six years since I was anywhere near the stuff and she *still* won't have that I'm gonna stay clean.She's very vocal about these concerns, too. If I get sick, she tells our entire family that she thinks I've relapsed again and I'm having withdrawals. She made a huge scene on Christmas day two years ago because I had a cold and was a bit sniffly and she decided that I must have been doing a ton of coke. If anything goes missing from any of the family's houses, she accuses me of having stolen it for drug money. I mostly just grin and bear it so as not to make waves, but recently she took it a step too far. I went away recently with some friends. On the first day of my trip, I dropped and broke my phone. Because she and my brother were unable to get ahold of me for a few days, she became convinced I had gone on a massive dope bender, and began telling my family and friends that she knew this to be the case. When I got home, I found myself being given an intervention and told how disappointed people were. It was kinda the straw that broke the camel's back, and I sort of flipped at my sister in law. I yelled at her, asking why the fuck she doesn't trust me and why she's so hellbent on undermining my success and believing that I'm incapable of staying clean. She got upset and told me she was only concerned for my wellbeing, but I said imo that's bullshit at this point it's absolutely about her not having faith in me and if she feels that way she should stay the fuck out of my business. At that point  she started crying and she and my brother left. I'm being told left and right that I'm an asshole and ungrateful because she's only looking out for me and I need to apologise, but I'm still upset that she evidently believes I'm incapable of doing this.

427,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my sister to get over the fact that I wore a bikini around her BF?,21996,gq6mop,1598,"I LOVE to swim and since we have a swimming pool in our back yard I am practically swimming daily.  I don't think I own a 1 piece swim suit so I am always wearing a 2 piece swim suit.  My sister's BF lives like 5 minutes away from our place and he spends a lot of time here.  the living room has a sliding glass door to the back yard and the window to my sister's room is looking outside the backyard.  I was taking a nap in the grass after I was done swimming and listening to music.  I didn't even know my sister had her BF over cause I was in the back yard for basically the whole afternoon (12-4).  My sister woke me up and called me an AH, for wearing something so ""skimpy"" around her BF.  I asked her what she meant and I guess her BF kept looking out the window while I was napping/swimming (I know weird).  I told her that if he was looking at me that is his problem and that I wasn't trying to cause anything.  She was PISSED at me, like I haven't seen her this mad at me since we were kids and had to share a room.  She full on told me ""not to dress like a whore when her BF is over"".  I told her to get the fuck over herself and if she has a problem with her BF looking AT ME then she should talk with him not me.

428,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling my roommate her aspirations of being an influencer are ""fucking pathetic""?",21984,kqr34m,1576,"TLDR: Roommate works a minimum of 50 hours a week and can barely support him and his girlfriend. She wants to be an influencer and isn’t bringing home any income. After witnessing the boyfriend have a mental breakdown from being overworked, I told the girlfriend that her aspirations were “fucking pathetic”. I’ve lived with a couple for a little over a year and a half. I’m in my early 20’s, they’re in their early 30’s. The boyfriend works 2 minimum wage jobs, at least 50 hours a week in order to provide for the two of them as the girlfriend is striving to be an “influencer” and doesn’t have a job. She spends most of her time taking pictures to post on Instagram and dming brands trying to get sponsorships. So far no income has come from this. Last week, the boyfriend had a complete breakdown (while the girlfriend wasn’t home) and tells me he’s exhausted from being extremely overworked. He’s straight-up sobbing saying that even though he’s working back to back shifts, he still isn’t making enough money to support the both of them and (which I didn’t know about till now) her frivolous spending. He even had to ask his parents to help with this month’s rent. I felt really bad for the guy. Skip forward to last night and I’m sitting chatting with the girlfriend and the topic of money came up. She started to complain that they weren’t making enough money for her to do the things she wanted. I politely asked her if getting a job and doing the Instagram thing on the side was an option, and she immediately got defensive. She told me that “of course that isn’t an option” and that she shouldn’t have to put her dreams on hold. Confused, I asked her what those dreams are. She said to inspire people. And then I said, which I probably shouldn’t have, “To do nothing?”. She got really offended and said that there’s so much that goes into it that I could NEVER understand. I mean, the girl takes pictures of lattes and her in yoga poses. She doesn’t even edit them, just uses the default filters on the app. I didn’t want to argue about the logistics of “influencing” so I instead brought up my concern for her boyfriend and told her that I think he may be overworking himself, he’s not happy, and he needs her help to support them financially. She says “Well, I don’t understand why we both have to be unhappy. At least one of us is pursuing our aspirations.” To that, I said, “Well if your aspirations are to do nothing while your partner busts their ass to support you, then your aspirations are fucking pathetic.” Later that evening I get a text from the boyfriend saying what I said crossed a line and now because of me, she thinks that he believes she does nothing and her “dreams” are pathetic. I feel bad but holy crap, I couldn’t just sit by and bite my tongue. AITA?"
429,Not the A-hole,AITA for not punishing my daughter for cursing and telling my husband my decision is final and he doesn't get a say this time?,21996,ienuun,1899,"This is going to be one of the most silliest post but here we go. I have a 9 (almost 10) year old daughter who got her first period recently. It was kinda a shock to see her get one so early. I never had the mensuration talk with her and we sat down for it. I didn't even get to say much. I just said that it's a natural process and that it's gonna happen every month for the next 40 years and she yelled ""Fuck this shit"" and went to her room.I have never heard her curse before and frankly, given the context, I found it hilarious. I mean, I can't even blame her for having that reaction. My husband heard it and thinks she is too young to curse and we must punish her. I told him he doesn't understand and that it's okay to give her a pass this time. He kept pushing and I just snapped and told him that we aren't punishing her for this and he doesn't get a say because he doesn't understand and that's final. If anything, me and my husband are to be blamed for not preparing her. I can't even imagine how scared she must have been when she saw all that blood with no context. And now I am telling her that it's gonna happen monthly for decades. Who wouldn't have that reaction? He mumbled and grumbled but let it go. But he definitely thinks that I am being lenient and irritated because it's his daughter too and I shouldn't have said he doesn't get a say. Am I the asshole?"

We have identical faces, but you can’t mix us up. I have long blonde hair, he has short black hair and piercings. He’s bigger, like he works out. No one mixes us up. We have known her for 2 years. She mixes our names up all the time. At least 3 times a day. We know she’s doing it on purpose to annoy us. So. Yesterday I was in living room and she called me my twin’s name. I just ignored her and pretended she wasn’t there. Then she called me my name and I answered her normally. My brother did the same, we did it few times. Now she’s mad at us, apparently we’re being extremely disrespectful and not being sympathetic because she makes “honest mistake” sometimes."
431,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my dad I hate my step siblings after they knocked over my dead mom’s urn?,21949,f6xtoi,1792,"Backstory:My mom died when I was like 4 and my dad remarried when I was 6. My step mom is alright and I don't have any problems with her. She had 3 kids from a previous marriage, an 18yo girl 17yo boy and 15yo girl, I am 18 so I'm the same age as the oldest, but I'm older by a couple months. At first when we all moved it I was happy to have siblings, but the feeling wasn't mutual at all and they excluded me a lot from things. Saying that I'm ""not one of them"" and other crap like that. Me and the 17yo fought A LOT like almost daily, nothing too bad just dumb kid stuff. Our parents nipped that in the bud but arguments with him were daily till i was like 13 and just gave up. The 18yo HATES me, cause of me and her brother fighting a lot and same with the 15yo. My dad and step mom tried to make us all one blended family but it just didn't work, I was open to it but they were intent on just blocking me out. Around 12 I just stopped trying and did my own thing, I have absolutely 0 relationship or attachment with any of them.  Main problem:  I was away at a friends house and I forgot to lock the door to my room.  My step siblings have had a problem with going into my room cause I keep my stuff organized and I’m the only one with a tv in my room (I paid for it). And they watch tv, I usually just let them to avoid talking to them.   I have a mini memorial of my mom in my room that has a plaque of my mom and her urn.  It’s not much but I like it, I guess all 3 were watching tv and somehow my urn got knocked over.........a lot of the ash is now in my carpet and now it’s basically just an empty thing.  When I got home I flipped my shit, it got bad enough that my dad came into my room and sent them out.  When I told him what happened he said that he’s sorry and that he will talk to him.  (This is where I may be the AH) my dad said something about never being too mad at “family”.  I had enough and told him exactly this “they aren’t my family, they have made home life shit for years and now knocked over the ashes of my mom.  I fucking HATE them.”  He went quiet and didn’t say anything and just left my room. My step siblings haven’t apologized (not that I’d accept anything they say). I feel bad what I said to my dad but I don’t regret a word of what I said.  AITA?Edit: thanks for the awards!!! Edit 2: when I was 7 I did something really stupid and put the plastic bag out and poured the ashes straight into the urn.  I regretted once I did it but I was a dumb 7yo.  And the urn has a chip in the ring so it never screwed on right and was wobbly"
432,Not the A-hole,AITA for dumping my gf after her unannounced backpacking trip,21935,ae5whx,4619,"Ok so this happened maybe three days ago, but first some context.Me and my (now ex) girlfriend of 3 years lived in a 2 bedroom apartment which I pay for by myself, as I make enough money to afford it and I didn’t want to trouble her by pressing her with a bill for a place that is a tiny bit out of her price range, instead we use a meter and pay the bill through my account, with her compensating her  spend. We also have always been big on trust since both of us have been cheated on in previous relationships, and didn’t want to go through that again in this one.The fact that I pay solely this apartment is important as it allows her to spend her money on things like more expensive gifts and the occasional excursion for us (which of course I pay in part for). Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.Anyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.First I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be “discovering herself” on this trip, and when I asked why hadn’t she told me she said because I wouldn’t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)Well an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: Gf: “why can’t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest”Me: “you can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out”I believe it was the right thing to do as she didn’t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn’t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.That night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?TLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house.

433,Not the A-hole,AITA for yelling at my wife for being unhelpful while I took our son to the ER for a broken arm?,21922,eyivk2,890,"My wife (33F) is a SAHM with our son (4M) and we also have a daughter (6F) in school. Last Friday I get a frantic call from my wife around noon that our son fell off the top bunk while she wasn’t looking and now his arm looks really really swollen.So I find him crying and holding an incredibly swollen, red arm sitting on the ground and refuses to let anyone touch it. My wife is sitting on the couch crying and saying how his arm looks so bad. I pick him up to go to the emergency room. I try to dress him since he can’t open his arms and ask her to get the car seat ready. She doesn’t move and keeps crying. I give up and do the best I can and call for my wife to get in...she just sobs and shakes her head saying “I can’t I can’t.” So I drive off without her.I got really annoyed at my wife at this point. We get to the hospital and they want to run him through some X-rays and he’s screaming bloody murder. Around 3pm I get a call from my daughter’s school saying that no one’s picked her up (my wife’s job) so I call my wife. No one picks up. I call 3-4 more times before I rush out to the school. My son was inconsolable at me leaving him. Even the doctors were confused why I had to leave so soon. I get home with my daughter and rush in to find my wife STILL CRYING on the phone to her sister. I absolutely let loose and yelled “where the FUCK were you??? Why didn’t you answer my calls?” She’s shocked and just screams at me back that she’s overwhelmed and can’t handle all this right now. I get our daughter out and tell my wife to look after her. My daughter is crying because mom’s crying and hangs on to my legs wanting to go with me. My wife makes no move to help me so I just ended up bringing our daughter with me to the hospital.The next day while our kids were both sleeping I couldn’t hold back and yelled at my wife for being absolutely zero help. She got equally mad and told me I humiliated her in front of her sister (when I yelled when she was on the phone) and that I should’ve been more considerate of the fact that she is really bad in emergencies. While I know she’s not great in emergencies, this was something else and I felt like I didn’t have a partner at all. Now she wants an emergency couples counseling session to “address my rage” but I am honestly conflicted. I’ve never yelled at her before and I do feel guilty but I also feel like these circumstances were extreme. However I did apologize for yelling and wonder if I made things worse. AITA?"

Combined this is very expensive and I pay for it all. I've offered and I am happy to do so.My son's girlfriend is morally opposed to pageants and afraid of horses. Her daughter has asked to do what her cousin does but isn't allowed to. She does tee ball and music lessons, which I also pay for but they are significantly cheaper than what the seven year old does. The other day my son's girlfriend brought up this ""favoritism"" I said it isn't favoritism, because I pay for two activities for both of them. She said it is going to give her daughter a ""complex"" so I need to even the money off and put the rest in a savings account. My husband and I laughed because that is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, and she stormed out of the house. My son actually said I should post this because he is conflicted (afraid of her).

We actually make more during this crisis even without allowing dine-in customers then my dad made before I worked here full time. Atop that I also often work when someone falls through(Be it kitchen work, serving, hosting whatever), I manage most of the accounting and I also started a social media presence for the restaurant which has blown up locally. Long story short, I work a minimum of 60 hours a week often more.Now I do all of this with love, I like it despite swallowing up all my time but that brings us to what I make. I literally make as much as the serving staff(Who are all under 20) would make if they worked full time, that is to say, I make what they would make in 40 hours while working 60+ hours and having triple the workload and I am tired of it.I tried speaking to my dad about it but I kept getting inconclusive answers or bullshit answers as an example, he talks about it being a difficult time for restaurants so cant increase my waged despite the fact we make more despite the crisis or shit like ""I'll think about it""I can barely pay my goddamn rent at this rate let alone save even a dime. So I ended up saying whats in the title, I could get another job like yesterday(Extreme shortage of chefs) and make at least double what I make right now starting out.Obviously this led to my dad and family blowing up at me and now I am worried if I am TA?"
436,Not the A-hole,AITA for requesting prayer breaks at work because my religious coworkers do even though I’m not religious?,21894,cnsiur,5185,"I’m an atheist who works in an international company in a very busy city. I have a lot of coworkers who come from a certain religious background that requires them to pray multiple times a day. I would say 90% of my coworkers share this faith and maybe 70-80% of them take the time out to go pray everyday. They get to leave the office 2 or 3 times in a day for 10 mins a piece for prayer and they get paid the same, don’t need to take time out of their lunch, etc.  I used to resent this and asked my boss who belongs to that faith why they were essentially having an extra paid 30 min break a day for doing the same work I do. She couldn’t give me a response other than religious considerations have to be made. Even though I’m a known atheist I decided I too wanted some time to meditate everyday. I told my manager I needed the same time as my coworkers and told her it was very important to me. She initially said no, and then I got a hastily written email saying of course I was welcome to take that time to meditate the same day. She’d obviously checked with HR and covered her ass. For the last six months I’ve been having my 30 mins ‘meditating’ out in our company garden everyday. This has caused a slight issue because other non religious people are starting to ask if they too can have ‘meditative time’ and it’s causing friction but imo either everyone should be able to have this or no one should. I recently told a friend this story and she reacted negatively- she said that I was being rude and ‘ruining it’ for everyone else and that at Xmas time my coworkers usually go over and beyond to fill in holiday hours so the rest of us can enjoy our holidays and that the same courtesy should be extended to them. I told her I’m not hurting anybody or taking their prayer times away from them, simply enjoying that privilege myself."
437,Not the A-hole,AITA for discriminating my grandchildren,21878,hnymq1,1555,"My daughter (L) got pregnant in her twenties and gave up a child for adoption. Though my husband and I were upset, we fully supported her and thought she was strong for making a tough decision. She’s doing well now and is married with kids. Her husband knows about the child she gave away for adoption. A while ago, we heard from her daughter (S) that she gave away. Our granddaughter contacted us sobbing that her adoptive family had given her away as a baby and she was in the foster system with an abusive family. She’s 12 years old. My husband and I agreed that even though L didn’t want her, she’s still our grandchild and we have the resources to help her. We adopted S and she now lives with us. We got S a new wardrobe and redid our guest room to be her room. We also made a college fund and put about $60k in it. Basically we treat her like how we treated L, S is now our daughter by law and in our hearts. L was indifferent to us adopting S. However, L went ballistic when we told her about S college fund. We didn’t think L would mind since we paid $80k a year for her college education and S is now our daughter too. L is mad because her other kids don’t get a college fund from us even though L and her husband have already gotten it taken care of. But, L says that we are spending more on S and aren’t treating the grandkids equally. She says that her kids will resent us and L for not being treated like S. However, S is our daughter now and L’s kids are our grandchildren. S has no support system besides us and we treat her just like L. We don’t discriminate among our grandchildren and if L had taken in S, she would’ve been treated like the other kids, aka no college fund. AITA?Edit: Thank you for the kind words! I’m so happy about all the well wishes that my S has gotten. I’ve been getting a lot of messages about this, but we weren’t the first people S contacted. S contacted L first (not sure exactly how she got the contact info but I remember it being an open adoption). S wanted to know more about her family and L thought that we were the best people that S could find answers from. L did tell her why she gave S up, but told her that it was a hard decision she made a long time ago and that she’s not sure if she’d be able to take S again. I’m not sure if S has her birth fathers information or called him. She knows about him and the circumstances though."
438,Not the A-hole,AITA For calling the cops after my halfbrother took my car while I was having dinner with family?,21864,kl50zz,1661,"I 23F have always been civil with my 19M half brother. We were close as kids but he started to have an attitude at 13 and pretty much stopped being nice and started messing with my things/making fun of me and doing pranks to annoy me/privacy was gone with him coming into my room and taking my things. Whenever I complained my stepmom would normalize his behavior and make excuses. My dad never really grounded him and thought that talking to him will get him to behave better. I'm currently in college I live in a rented apartment and have car to help me get to the university or other places. The car isn't expensive or fancy at all I saved up for it 2 years ago.I decided to have Christmas dinner with my family- It's the perfect opportunity to be with family since I haven't seen my dad in a while. I arrived at my dad's house. And left my purse and my keys on the kitchen island after my stepmom told me to help with dinner.My half-brother started talking about my car in the kitchen while my stepmom was listening and asked if he could take it for a couple of hours to hang out with friends. I politely told him no. He threw a fit and brought up how I needed to relax and not worry but my answer was still the same.While we were sitting at the dinner table. My half-brother got up,washed his hands and I thought he went outside. I got busy talking to my dad and after I got up to wash my hands I noticed my car keys weren't there. I went outside to ask him and neither he nor my car were there I lost it I started calling his phone but he hung up on me several times. I was furious I told my dad I'd call the police if he didn't come back with the car.my stepmom jumped to defend him and said I was being unreasonable to call the police. I called him one last time then I called the police. My stepmom freaked out when my halfbrother got picked up by the police. She told me to go explain the situation to the authorities otherwise he'd spend the night in jail. But I refused especially since I still hadn't got my car back.Stepmom yelled that I ruined dinner and that it was no big deal he was going to return it after ""borrowing"" it from me but he didn't really borrow it and she heard me say no. I don't know what she told the police. But I didn't give permission to use the car. My stepmom's side of family are mad at me for doing this to my brother and hinted that I don't consider him family. My dad's side of family sided with me saying he deserved it. My dad said I overreacted and I shouldn't have called the police when he disappeared for 4 hours.Edit: he DID NOT borrow it but my stepmom said I let him borrow it which is not true.Edit just to clarify I talked to the police about what happened and I learned later that my stepmom said that her son was allowed to borrow it and that it was a misunderstanding. I wasn't going to let her continue to lie but my dad told me to back off and let it go. This really upset me my half-brother wasn't even berated the way I was by the family."
439,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I back out of donating my kidney to my ex-fiancee’s brother after my ex-fiancee and I broke up?,21822,d01aq9,904,"For five years I dated a girl I’ll call Mia. We got engaged last March and were supposed to get married next year, but two weeks ago I learned that our entire relationship was a lie. Someone showed me a dashcam recording of her saying that she still loves her ex and she was only with me because I’m the better choice. I confronted her, she admitted it was true, I called off the wedding and broke up with her.I’m determined to move past this as soon as possible and onto better things, the things that I should have achieved had Mia not wasted five years of my life. But there’s an issue that has me on the fence: I was supposed to donate my kidney to Mia’s brother Tom, and now I don’t know if I should do it.Tom has ESRD and needs a second kidney transplant as soon as possible because the kidney from his first transplant is failing. I’m not that close to him and I was only going to do it because I wanted to help Mia’s family in any way I could because I though they were going to be m family. But now that I know that she was just playing me the whole time, I’m having second thoughts. Organ donation is a big deal, I will literally risk my life to give part of myself to someone, and at this point I don’t want to do it for the brother of the girl who lied to me, used me and made me a fool for five years.Would I be the asshole if I back out?"
440,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my best friend that I'm not happy for her,21819,i3ee0t,1912,"I dated my ex-boyfriend for a few years and we broke it off a few months before covid. We were both madly in love and I'm still not over him. My best friend knows this.A few months ago, she started getting distant from me and it's super unusual for me because she needs me for EVERYTHING. Like just a few things that I helped her do: find colleges, apply to colleges, help donate money for her college fund, help her build her resumé, find her therapy, find her a job, and countless other things. I even paid for a lot of stuff for her, like going on trips and such. She didn't really do much for me and was somewhat of an emotional support because we'd always talk about her, but then I really didn't mind and didn't care what I did for her. She was my BFF and you love ur best friends. They're sisters.Last month, she broke and told me that the reason that she's so distant is because she's quarantining with my ex and they're a thing. Whatever hopes I had of getting back to my ex are squashed because I don't think I can get over him hooking up with my best friend.I'm super heartbroken and I know that you don't own people, but that doesn't mean that you can't be upset about their betrayal. Yes, dating your best friend's ex that she still loves is a betrayal.She asked me if I was happy for her (wtf??) because she finally got a good job and a nice boyfriend. That job she has is solely because of me because I asked an old acquaintance to return a favor by hiring my best friend. He wanted to hire someone else, but I begged him to hire her.I know how people are sometimes hurt but then they say ""..but I'm truly happy for you"". I honest to god don't think they mean it and when I say I'm happy for someone, I want to mean it. I'm not happy for my friend. I just am not. I can't make myself be. I told her as such and told her to stop contacting me. She's now blowing up my emails and DMs because she's so ""hurt"" by what I said to her.My dad said that I should've just kept this to myself since I know my best friend is a sensitive person and is hurt. But what about me? Am I given a sensitivity pass because I've looked after my friend for so long. Do my feelings just stop mattering at some point?EDIT: My conversation with my best friend went as followed: She called me with the news and said that she didn't know how to tell me (didn't apologize FYI) and then she followed it up with how she's finally doing well and doesn't have to rely on my for money since she has a nice job and also a nice boyfriend. I told her I was not happy for her. I reminded her that I got her the job (she knew and was fine with it) and that I've done so much for her over the years and she thanks me by backstabbing me and getting with my ex. She knew that it would hurt me and if she'd done it when I was well-over him or with my permission, I'd feel differently. Then, I told her to not contact me again because clearly I'm her friend but she was never my friend and I want to stick with people who are supportive toward me and reciprocate my friendship. Then, I ended the call. "
441,Not the A-hole,AITA for being really crude to my nosy aunt about my sex life?,21816,jaq5yq,950,"For some reason, whenever my aunt calls and catches up with family she really picks on me. She sees me as the slutty one in the family with a steady stream of boyfriends. I've only had like half a dozen and I'm nearly 25, for heaven's sake! Still, compared to her 23 yr old pitch perfect valedictorian daughter, I guess I'm easy pickings. This last week, she had the nerve on a family call with my cousin, my older sis, and my dad to bring up my dating life. Something silly about how I'm getting along without meeting my bf that often. (You know, I'm hungry and thirsty for sex unlike her perfect little girl.)She made a really bad comment about how I should be careful and that you never know when you can get pregnant (that's why her daughter's waiting to get engaged .. little did she know .. but my cousin and I are tight so I wouldn't rat on her). In the heat of the moment, I responded, don't worry, I make sure it's only on my face each time. No chance of pregnancy there.My sis thought it was hilarious, my dad stifled a laugh, but my aunt got mortified. She huffed and puffed about how rude I was and how inappropriate it was to bring this up with family. Wait ... sex lives are inappropriate in family conversations? Wouldn't know it from talking to her.Apparently my aunt and dad had a long call afterwards and she had the nerve to tell me to apologize to her and for setting a bad example for her perfect daughter.Sigh. I just did something lukewarm to ease off the family drama but AITA here?"
442,Not the A-hole,AITA for taking my birth control in public?,21781,eno5q8,3159,"I’ve been taking oral contraceptives for about 6 years now. When I first started, I was worried about what other people would think (I was raised in a pretty “sex-is-taboo” household) and hid that I was taking them very well. Now, however, I’m in my mid twenties and I’m comfortable enough in my skin that I don’t really mind if people know I’m on the pill. Anyway, I was out on a double date with a couple we know last night and the alarm on my watch started going off (vibration). It was time for me to take my pill. While we’re all chatting, I reach down into my purse that’s beside me in the booth and get my pill, put it in my mouth, and take a drink of water. Whole thing probably took 30 seconds. My friend didn’t comment, but her boyfriend made a face and said “did you just take something?”I said “yeah, my birth control.”He made another face and said, “that’s inappropriate don’t you think?”I just kind of exchanged a look with my boyfriend who seemed as lost as I was. I mumbled an “uh, ok” cause I hate confrontation. He went on, “you should probably go to the bathroom to do that. It’s really not polite to take that kind of pill in front of a group of people. We get it, you have sex.”I really had no idea what to say, so my boyfriend changed the subject to the game that was on over our heads at the bar and the night carried on. I was pretty much floored. Wtf? I had been doing this for a while now, any time I’m out and my alarm goes off, I’ll just take my pill and go about my day. Wouldn’t it be like taking any other medication? Or Advil? I don’t really see the problem. AITA?"
443,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not wanting my flat to be ""kink-friendly"" and potentially getting my flatmates evicted.",21775,horvdu,1908,"So i'm 20(M) and have just moved in with three people at uni. Sarah, Joey and Michelle. Fake names obviously.Sarah and Joey are dating and part of a fairly sizeable fetish community locally and they go to a lot of gatherings and are generally fairly openly kinky. Grand, you do you, go nuts.We moved in together for the upcoming year and all was going pretty well until two days ago when I came home and Michelle immediately pulled me into her room to explain that Sarah and Joey had put up a ton of LGBT and Fetish related flags all over the living room (side note TIL about fetish pride flags, there are a lot of them). They are only those little hand sized flags but they're in a big chain thing across one wall of the living room. Then there's some ""art"". It's just close up pictures of genitals that I am 100% certain include the two of them and the other people from their little club.Then there's a shelf that used to have a couple of tiny cactii on it that now has a leather mask, riding crop, and condom bowl. I don't think it's unreasonable to say that we were both obviously beyond uncomfortable with the entire situation. We sat Joey and Sarah down and told them we were uncomfortable and it all had to go. They said it was unfair because it was their lifestyle and they wanted people who came over to the flat to know it was ""a kink friendly place to be yourself"" for any guests or additional partners that might come over and that the living room shouldn't be a place of oppression (unless it's consensual).I said it absolutely fucking wasn't and the only ""kink friendly place to be yourself"" was your private spaces, and that the living room wasn't a place for sex when it's shared. They feel like they'd made their lifestyle clear before we moved in and that the living room is shared and therefore they can do what they like in it. Michelle and I explained the situation to the housing company we're living in and asked if we could break the lease and move into a two bed together. The manager we spoke to went *nuts* and screamed at Joey and Sarah that he wanted them out and was going to contact his lawyer. I think he's under the impression that they're going to have loads of people over for sex parties all the time and we can only have a limited number of guests. Also that it's disgusting.Some of our mutual friends are furious that we've potentially made them homeless over ""a few flags and kink things"" so AITA reddit?"
444,Not the A-hole,"AITA for embarrassing my ""influencer"" friend by intentionally letting her post a meme that made her look stupid?",21749,ky4jdq,960,"I feel kind of bad, but I have a friend who thinks of herself as a highly popular mom influencer (she's in her 40s), and she has a habit of taking other people's posts, memes, etc and reposting them as her own.She even steals personal, heartfelt words from other bloggers and Instagrammers about their struggles with body image, depression, etc and slightly changes them to repost as her own. She's grown a decent following from this and gets sponsored by brands for ""keeping it real.""Honestly, I'll admit part of me is likely jealous, so I'll own that, but mostly I just think it's gross that she is lying and making up a whole personality that has people thinking she's something she's not.Anyway, there's this challenge going around on social media called the Hidden Cat Challenge, and I thought it would be funny to send her a photo of Monica's apartment from Friends and say, ""Bet you can't find the cat in this photo."" I figured she'd recognize it and laugh, but within a few minutes, she had posted it on all of her social media telling people it was her latest Air B&B and making up an elaborate backstory about a random cat that lived there and challenging people to find it.I messaged her asking why she would lie, and she just said that she needed content and ""no one would ever know.""So I just kept my mouth shut and sat back to see what would happen. Obviously people immediately began calling her out, and she tried to defend herself, but it wasn't long before she took it down and had to turn off comments on all her social accounts. She's now telling me I'm an AH for letting her post it, and I may have cost her sponsors and taken food out of her kids mouths. AITA?Edit: Thank you to those who sent awards. Very surprised and encouraged. Also dying that there is an Evil Cackle award. Does that make me an AH? HahaEdit 2: Just to clarify - I had no idea she was going to post it. The whole point was that the photo didn't even have a cat in it... It was a joke. She posted it with a whole fake story AND tried to make people find the non-existent cat in the photo, which added hugely to her embarrassment. After she got mad, I even tried to help by suggesting she simply tell people she accidentally posted the wrong photo or even say it was a joke, but she locked down her profiles, which obviously made her look bad. None of our friends blame me, but she is seriously upset and is refusing to speak to me. I never intended to make her look bad, but since she brushed me off when I first called her out, I figured I'd just let it play out. I guess that is why she thinks I'm the AH."
445,Not the A-hole,AITA for (rudely) refusing to give my kid's hand-me-downs and old toys & furniture to my sister?,21758,cpbrj0,2339,"I found out I was pregnant with my daughter at 19 years old, had her at 20. When I told my parents they said they'ld be happy for me but they didn't want to pay for anything, have us live with them or babysit all the time, basically wanting to treat me they same they would if I had kids older and not as a teenager still going to university. I was already living independently, both my boyfriend and I worked and we live in a country with free/cheap education and healthcare. In our culture families are close and grandparents are very involved in their grandchildren's lives, so I thought they'd still be emotionally supportive.During my pregnancy I asked my parents and/or sister for help a few times: driving me to the hospital when I started contracting 3 months early, picking me up for a family event when I wasn't allowed to drive, helping me prepare meals to put in the freezer, and staying with them for a weekend when I was due any day and my boyfriend couldn't be home. They refused, telling me that I was expecting to be catered to. They also didn't want to come with me to ultrasounds or basically hear me talking about anything baby related, telling me that I was trying to win them over and have them ""forget that I was making dumb decisions"". When I spoke to other relatives my sister ""joked"" that I was trying to get gifts from them. I had severe post-partum depression and thought I was an entitled jerk and a failure, unworthy of the baby or anybody's support but impoved a lot after months of therapy. My relationship with my parents started improving after they apologised for not getting me to the hospital. They told me they were afraid I was going to destroy my life and thought that they were showing tough love. Impovement in our case meant that we we're on speaking terms and they're allowed in their granddaughter's life, we're not close.Which brings us to today, 3 years later. My sister (29yo) is pregnant and she's getting a completely different treatment than I did when I was treated ""as an independent adult"". Our parents stay with her when her husband isn't home, don't let her do any housework, paid for her birthing class and a maternity photoshoot and get her whatever she craves to eat. Yesterday my mother called and asked me to bring over to her house all of my daughter's old furniture, toys and anything else of her baby stuff I have kept because she wants to set up a nursery so my sister's baby will have everything they need when she babysits. Apparently my sister wanted my parents to buy some new stuff to keep at their house but my mother told her mine will do. I answered that mine will not do, my sister should try to get freebies from other relatives instead, and ended the call. I've been getting texts from my parents and sister telling me to come to my senses and calling me petty, immature and resentful among other things.So, reddit, am I the asshole here?"

She was away at family's when she had her baby so this was a small unplanned baby shower for her. After an hour or so her baby got fussy and she started breast feeding her baby. One of the friend we'll call her rb (rude bich) started looking up set and asked ""Don't you think you should cover up especally since there is a man here?"" We all just kind of looked at her. My male friend said it's ok his wife breastfeeds. And his wife nods her head. Well this upset rb and looked towards me and said to get a blanket. So I got her one and she said no it's to cover up with."" So I did as she asked and opened up the blanket all the while all the other people were giving me a strang look and I covered rb head and sat back down.Rb got mad and took it off and said not that Jane needs to cover I said what for. Rb get's up and tries to put the blank on Jane I finally had enough and said if she didn't like seeing some one breast feed then she can either look away or leave. Yeah she got mad saying how I am chosing Jane over her and that she known me longer. I told her that you should known by now that I don't belive in covering up regardless of where you are at and that it's my house. I also told her that she knows what a pain it is trying cover pop a breast in a screaming wiggle babys mouth so have a nice day. so yeah she is mad at me but the rest of us had a good time visiting.So witah maybe for putting the blanket on rb head lol"

I pick her up from school or dance practice sometimes when her parents are working. I’ve noticed over the last few weeks she’s been smelling very ripe. I was driving her home one day and said (this is abridged) “Hey I know you’re going through a lot of bodily changes right now and you’re really growing up. I think it might be time to start wearing deodorant.”She said “I smell?” And I said “Yah, just a little. No big deal. Just pick up some deodorant, your mom has some.” Her parents called and were furious saying she’s going through a difficult and sensitive time and how dare I make her insecure about her natural bodily functions. I said “Sorry, I thought if roles were reversed I’d want someone to tell me. Are you really saying you didn’t notice her smelling like BO all the time?” They said she had to come to them and ask for it because someone pushing the issue would make her insecure. And by circumventing her psychological timeline I’ve given her a complex for the rest of her adolescence, maybe beyond.  I didn’t think it was a big deal at all, but now my niece and her parents are so upset, I feel awful!  I’m wondering what I missed here. AITA?"
449,Not the A-hole,AITA for buying my 5th property rather than help out my siblings?,21721,glf7om,3896,"For context, even when I (44M) was a child I was incredibly into owning property and designing houses. I work as an architect and am doing quite well for myself. Bought my first duplex here in Germany along time ago where I rent out both part. Then I own two houses in Italy and one in Spain. Two of them are get rented out as Holiday homes while the last one I use for vacations and rent out a room to a friend of mine. So I have a lot of passive income at the moment, but only after a lot of time and money investments and refurbishing of these houses. (I rent in NYC at the moment as my job has moved made me move here temporarily).My brother (48M) does an apartment. He has a family with two kids while my wife and I are childless. They are currently looking to purchase a house that fits all of them nicely. While they have found their dream house, its out of budget for them. Meanwhile, my wife and I are about to buy our 5th house, this time in France. It's going to be one of our largest purchases yet, significantly larger than anything else we have done. Its a great deal on the property however, and ideally what my wife and I want to retire in.When having a family facetime with my siblings and parents, I brought it up. Initially very happy for me, my brother mentioned how he needs a larger home for his family and how I should give up on this opportunity to give him money for his house and spend the rest on refurbishing their new home. I just laughed and said flat out no. (Edit: Thought this was a joke)This was apparently the wrong move, my entire family turns against me and starts berating me. After 10 minutes of them taking turns telling me to buy my brother a house, I said I'd think about it and left.I am a bit of a pushover so after talking to my wife we agreed we could wait and buy their house and rent it out to them at no profit. Apparently this was insulting to him, having his younger brother be his landlord and my parents said I should just outright give him the money we have been saving.I told em to piss off, and started moving forward with the paperwork on our house in France. After talking to my friends, they said I should put family first and its not like we are struggling for money.Now I am confused, AITA?EDIT: This edit is super late but I want to clarify my brother DOES have money for a 4 bedroom house. He isn't broke. Just not enough money for his dream house. The dream house is approximately double as expensive.LAST EDIT: Please check my other comments, they add some context but I don't want to double the length of this posting."
450,Not the A-hole,AITA for attending a party even though I was only invited as a pretty face?,21701,jcunk4,1401,"Last month I (25F) got surprisingly invited to an exclusive party that entertained a bunch of tech and creative people who were killing it in their industry and are important clients of my company. The invite came as a surprise because many of my colleagues, who have been working in the company way longer than me, did not receive an invitation. I was told by a good friend of the CEO (who throws these parties) that the reason I'm most likely invited, has less to do with my work, and more to do with the fact I'm a good looking woman and he wanted a few pretty faces around.At first, I was furious and didn't want to show up but then I decided f\*ck it. I figured it would still be a great event to network and to build those LinkedIn connections so I went. In the end, I managed to partner up with a few of these suits and basically created a role for myself within their companies.When my sister heard of this she got mad. She said I shouldn't have gone and what I did was morally wrong. She thinks I supported misogynistic behavior and says I should have gone to HR. I don't think I did anything wrong. I used this invite as an opportunity to advance my career and I don't feel bad about it.AITA for this?"
451,Not the A-hole,AITA for stranding a date without a ride because she was ignoring me?,21702,bvk83l,1041,"So last weekend I went on a tinder date with a girl who I’ve been chatting to for a while. It was our second date and I thought things were going pretty well.We end up at this rowdy bar a bit far out (30-40min) which I recommended. It was good fun until she sees someone she knows, this guy she went to college with, and they start chatting. I awkwardly try to join in but I’m basically ignored. I leave them to it to get some food and come back like 30 min later. They’re still chatting. I stand around like an idiot trying to join the convo but at one point the guy literally blocks me out with his back and my date says and does nothing. They back into a corner and only talk to each other. At this point I go out and grab a smoke. She comes out after me and apologizes, says she hasn’t seen this guy in ages. I tell her that’s cool but I’m just gonna head home soon. She asks me to wait for her bc she doesn’t have a ride and it’s far from home. So I wait bc whatever, night is ruined and I might as well just hang out. I wait another 20 min before heading back inside to tell her I’m going home and she can either come with me or stay. I see them in the same corner with the guy blocking my view. I try to talk to her but he keeps turning to block me away. I gesture to her that I’m going and she holds up a finger like “wait a minute” and instead of coming to talk to me she just keeps talking to her friend. I’ve had it at this point and I just text her “leaving now, bye” and head straight to my car and leaves. I get frantic calls about 15 min later. She asks me where I am and if I could go back and pick her up since she doesn’t have a ride and her friend doesn’t live close to her like I do. I say “no” and hang up. Anyways the next day I get the longest, angriest chain of texts in my life. She’s upset because I left her with no ride and she had to beg the bartender to call her a cab because she ran out of cash and can’t get uber/lyft for some reason. She calls me a POS and to never call her again and that she’ll be telling anyone she knows not to ever go on a date with me. My roommate and his gf both agreed that the girl sucks, but they think I should’ve just waited longer and made sure she got home. AITA for what I did?"
452,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting to break up with my girlfriend/stepsister?,21684,afl15b,1617,"First of all, I know how that sounds, but it's really not like that.My girlfriend and I were childhood friends turned high school/college sweethearts. We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.It's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.Honestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says ""go tell your sister x"". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to ""What did you expect from the crazy bitch?"" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.This living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.AITA? Are we all bad? Is it inappropriate no matter what to date your ""stepsister"" who you live with?"
453,Not the A-hole,AITA for forcing my vegan daughter to cook meat?,21652,ij7etm,4974,"My daughter (16F) has been vegan for about a year. Me, my husband and her brother (14M) have tried to be as supportive as possible. We aren't a family that eats meat daily, so it wasn't that hard for me to accommodate her. When I do cook meat, I also make something else for her and keep the side dishes common for all. She does have some seperate dishes, but most are common and I clean it if I have to cook for her. Few months into the vegan lifestyle, she tried to convince us to go vegan and would get increasingly angry when we said no. Me and husband shut that behaviour down hard and told her that she can follow whatever diet she wanted, but she cannot expect others to. She sulked for a while, but stopped doing that. Last weekend, I cooked the family a big pot of chilli (a small vegan one and a large beef one), so that I can refrigerate it and use for the next week. Next day, I found the fridge empty of both the chilli and turns out, my daughter decided that we were are being too callous about meat. She felt the smell was ""too much"" when she opened the fridge door and that she can't anything from the fridge after that without gagging or puking. She told me that I need to throw out all the vegan food in the fridge and restock them. Me and my husband were livid. Wasting food is never okay with us and that was a lot of food. I told her I am going to continue using the vegan products in the fridge and she can either eat it or not, but I am not wasting food. That whole week she kept making faces at dinner while she ate. As a punishment, I gave her the recipe and told her she needs to buy them and cook it next weekend. She yelled and begged, but I stood firm. In the end, she did it. When the cooking was finished, I told her that wasting food is never okay in this house and pointed out that instead of x amount of meat being used, 2x amount of meat (Since this seems to be confusing. I meant as in x amount in the pot she wasted + x amount in the new one. I didn't purposefully make her put more than what was used previously) was used because she threw the food away. Now, she started crying and yelling at me about how awful and disgusting I was because I not only forced her buy meat (which she is very much against), I also forced her to cook it and now I am also telling her that it was her fault. She is really upset about this. So, I am wondering if I went too far. Should I have picked a different punishment? My husband and brother definitely think what I did was right while my parents thinks I was in the wrong. I thought I will put it to a vote. AITA?"
454,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting to accept my husband’s affair child?,21637,iuaqzs,2686,"My husband and I have been married for 7 years... happily I thought. We have two girls 5,4 and two boys 2 and unborn. He’s due anyday. I lost my job back in March due to the pandemic and it’s been so nice being a stay at home mom to the kids.Our 4th child is due any day now and a about two days ago I received a bombshell... my husband had an affair. It broke me to the core. He is the love of my life, then he hit me with the second part of the news they had a baby about a month ago he’s about two months early and in intensive care and his mother is an addict and was arrested and they want custody to go to my husband. He told me I let myself go all these months and that it was a moment of weakness. He’s telling me that we could still be a happy family and that his baby needs a father. AITA for not wanting any of this? His side of the family is calling me a monster for turning away a child in need. I feel like I’m living a nightmare."
455,Not the A-hole,AITA for saying ‘what did she expect’ when my girlfriend told me her best friend’s affair partner has vanished into thin air when she told him she was pregnant?,21620,gda74l,3008,I’ve been with my girlfriend coming up to 1 year now. Her best friend has been having a 3 month affair with a married man. She knows he is married. She found out she was pregnant a month back and he has completely disappeared into thin air. He has blocked or deleted her from tinder and she never got his real name (they both went by aliases) and now she is desperately searching for him on Facebook but nothing even in the ballpark has come up. The guy offered her abortion money and offered to go with her. She refused because she has a 3 y/o and she wants a sibling for her baby. I can’t say I didn’t see him disappearing. He’s a piece of shit coward for having an affair in the first place and so of course he’s gonna abscond from a pregnancy from his side chick too. From my perspective it’s fairly obvious he was using my girlfriends friend and she should have either known that or have been prepared to deal with the consequences. My girlfriend is very worried about her friend and keeps talking to me about it and asking what I think even though I’ve made it clear I don’t approve of either of their trashy behavior. I told her ‘well what did she expect?’ She keeps asking me if I think ‘as a man’ is it possible he will come back. I said hell no. Sometimes especially within the context of a couple talking let’s be frank we won’t always be politically correct. She flipped her shit and said that my attitude towards her pregnant friend is misogynistic and I’m being heartless. I don’t think I am and I feel I’m allowed to have an obvious opinion such as that.
456,Not the A-hole,AITA for replacing room keys for $2 to avoid a $250 fee in our housing units?,21597,irbwwg,1682,"I live in a housing unit / dorm just outside of our college. It's not affiliated and is run by a third party company. It's a bit average, but it's an nice place to live and is a bit cheaper than living on campus.The problem is our room keys. We use cards with magnetic strips on the back, like you would find in a motel. Most of these cards are between 3 and 6 years old, and in terrible condition - when you move in, you get given cards from the last people in that room and if you're lucky, you have minimal problems, but this is the minority more than the majority.If you want a replacement card for any reason, you are charged $250. Lost, damaged or just not working - it's $250. Most people just make sure they come and go during office hours so the RA can let them in if their card doesn't work, or people just share within a room as they might have 1 working card between 4 people. This doesn't really work for me, because I work until 4am most nights, so if my card doesn't work, I have to sleep in my car until someone can let me into the building at 8am.Recently my card stopped working altogether - wouldn't swipe in at all. The office staff told me it would be $250, despite the card being around since the beginning of time, which is clear because you can't even read the name of the company that was once printed on it. No exceptions. Now this sucks, because I - like most people here, don't just have a spare $250 for a card.So I did a bit of research. A card with a mag stripe doesn't have a lot of security on it. So I purchased a $85 card reader/writer from Amazon and had it sent to me overnight. The next day, I borrowed a roommates card, and cloned it onto a new blank card (the machine came with 20) and it worked amazingly. Problem solved. Of course, my roommates heard about this, so I cloned all their broken, worn cards onto new ones and we just threw the old ones into the office drop box.This spread like wildfire, and when everyone started coming back after COVID restrictions, I was the go-to person for card replacements. I charged people $2 for the card ($1 to help me pay off the machine and $1 for the blank card) and then just threw the damaged cards in the office drop box as well.The building administration caught on after I had done about 50 cards and asked to speak with me. They gave me a massive lecture on how I was depriving them of much needed income during a pandemic and that it was a security issue that I was cloning cards and said I need to stop what I was doing and they will be the only people who can provide cards.I thought I was doing something good and helping out people who couldn't afford the replacement, but the lecture the administrators gave me got me thinking that I may be the AH as they're pretty good to us otherwise."
457,Not the A-hole,AITA for not changing my tattoo based on my childs pronouns?,21587,dbhs1d,2370,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Basically I [M42] got tattoos of the names of all 3 of my children. I got them going down my arm and they read from top to bottom (not actual names) ""Andy, Sara, Kate"". I had these tattoos all done at once after Kate was born knowing she would be my last. My oldest child Andy[T22] came out as trans and has decided she only goes by female pronouns now. My wife[F41] immediately supported her and made sure that I would too without any arguement or else she would divorce me. It was a huge family issue for a while but eventually it was solved and everything has been good for the last little while. I'm slowly learning more and trying to accept my daughter and her new pronouns and her name change to Athena. The problem arose yesterday when my wife and Athena sat down with me and told me there was an issue. The tattoo going down my arm still reads ""Andy"" and not ""Athena"" and my wife claims this is hurting our daughter and putting a strain on our relationship. My wife told me she wants me to get it touched up to correct it but I explained to her tattoos  don't work like that and you can't just change ""Andy"" to ""Athena"". I told her I would most likely need laser tattoo removal surgery and then would need to pay the cost of a brand new tattoo which I can not afford either of. I explained how my tattoo is such a non issue that I don't understand why this needs to be brought up now. Athena yelled at me and called me a shitty father and said if I don't support who she is, I just need to leave her life. My wife threatened to go stay with her parents with the kids if I don't ""get my act together"". I personally don't see the reason to change the tattoo and this feels like a bigger problem then it should be.So im basically wondering if im the asshole in this situation."
458,Not the A-hole,AITA for not helping my husband babysit?,21581,hu6hew,2479,"I never wanted kids. The idea of family is very suffocating to me and I was never willing to date a man with children. When i met my husband he said he didn't have any and didn't want any. A year later when he was drinking he admitted that he had gotten his high school girlfriend pregnant when they were both 18 and begged her to abort but she hadn't wanted to so he had a son who he had never met and he had signed away his parental rights. I was annoyed that he lied but I 100% believe that men have the right to walk away.When my stepson was sixteen his mother passed away and he found my husband's contact information from an old friend. I completely supported my husband taking him and stepping up, and I actually really liked him. We have a good friendship, but obviously he doesn't view me as a parent. He married the most annoying woman ever and they have three children.He recently asked if we would be able to babysit overnight so they could go to a wedding. My husband agreed and I reminded everyone I don't babysit. My husband said it would be fine and I didn't need to help. Well that lasted about ten minutes, because my husband does not know what to do with children and was begging for me to help. His DIL gave him a list of rules and things they aren't allowed to eat, so he was in a pissy mood over that and once the kids actually started running around and making noise he couldn't handle it and expected me to step in.Well I didn't. I'm actually a terrible person and let them have water guns, so my husband ended up throwing a tantrum and locking himself in the bedroom. I did make sure the children didn't die, but like I stated to everyone involved, I do not babysit. They got into food they weren't supposed to have (no allergies) and didn't sleep at all, but they are alive. DIL is furious with me, because I'm the woman and I am apparently responsible, and my husband is off sulking."
459,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting to lie about having a baby with a lesbian?,21573,gak45b,1606,"I (30m) had a son with my ex when we were teenagers (we were 15 and 16) my son is about to turn 15 in May. We did not intend on having a child that young, but we decided to make it work. It was a wonderful decision & I love my son so much. Our relationship did not last, as my ex realized she was gay a couple years after our son was born. We ended on good terms, and currently split custody of my son. My son stays with me and my girlfriend (29f) during the week, and his mother and her wife on the weekends.    My girlfriend and I just moved in together recently, and I have just began to get close with her family recently as well. My girlfriend and son get along very well, but my girlfriend wants me to lie about the situation I have with my son. For context, my girlfriend's family is very religious (jehovah's witness) and while she is not as religious as they are, she fears they will judge me or ""not like me"" when they find out that I had a child with a lesbian who is very involved in my son's life.  She also told me they would be uncomfortable with the fact that I had a child outside of wedlock.    My girlfriend's suggestion was to lie, and tell her parents (if it ever came up) that I was previously married to my son's mother, and that she left me, or PASSED AWAY, and to absolutely not mention the lesbian part. I don't feel comfortable lying about my son for several reasons: \- I love this woman, and I want any love her family has for me to be based on authenticity. \- I do not want to set the precedent for my son that lying is acceptable to make people like you.\-I do not believe it is wrong to be gay, and I won't tip-toe around it in order to spare feelings. \- My son is a valid & legitimate person whose story matters, and I won't erase that because it is a little different than most people.My girlfriend is really upset with me, and says that it isn't a big deal, and that my son doesn't even need to know. She is hesitant to let me spend time with her parents now & after this stay-at-home order is over. AITA?"
460,Not the A-hole,"AITA for child locking my aunt, and then leaving her at a gas station?",21565,gpr17s,1517,"My (16f) aunt (33f) lives with my family. She has me drive her around, and refuses to sit in the front passenger seat because she wants to act like it’s a taxi/chauffeur situation, which is shitty of her, but I haven’t said anything.The other day we were driving through a restaurant drive through, and it was packed. The parking lot was full. My aunt got out of the car while we were in the drive through, and I asked what the fuck she was doing. She told me she was “getting claustrophobic”, and I told her to stay in the car so she doesn’t get hit by another car. (My reasoning for saying this is she wanted to walk close to the actual road to smoke, where traffic’s busy. y’know normal road.)She ignored me and got out anyway, so when I pulled up to the drive through window, I got out and put child lock on the back doors. I did this because my aunt has done this several times before, has almost gotten hit when she does it, and once had her foot run over by a car because she does it. (Which, btw, she blamed on me even though another car ran over her foot...)I got our food, my aunt gets back in, we get on the main road, it’s a traffic jam. My aunt tries getting out of the car again, and finds that she’s child locked. She starts screaming and cussing at me, calling me a little mother fucker and screaming at me to let her out. So when we could pull over again, I pulled over, let her out, and told her she could call someone else for a ride home. (I left her at a gas station)I got home and my parents asked where my aunt was. I explained what happened, my mom told me I was in the right, and my dad flipped his shit. He told me to go out and pick her back up, and I told him to pick her up himself, because I’m done driving her around because she acts like a toddler. He decided it was appropriate to call me a spoiled bitch before leaving to pick her up.AITA for child locking my aunt, and then leaving her at a gas station?Info: The “traffic jam” I mentioned: One lane stopped, while the one right next to it kept moving. People were actively moving and getting into the lane that wasn’t stopped. Also: no, my aunt doesn’t have a mental disability. She’s just been spoiled by her parents and my dad. And yes, she is my dad’s sister.Also also: My dad made a deal with me to get the car. I saved up $2,000 as a “down payment” for the car, and he’d make monthly payments of $200 to the guy we bought the car from. Or so he tells me. At this point in time, I have paid more for the car than he has, as I’ve only had it for four months. And yes, I work (or rather worked... I got laid off back when everything shut down)Second edit for info: I didn’t leave her stranded. She had her phone, and if she chose not to call someone, that’s on her.Also: You know how some people go really fast in a residential neighborhood? Apply that to the restaurant’s parking lot. People get really mad/fast in chick-fil-a parking lots for some reason.Also also (again): I’m in America. We get our licenses at 16, and I’m almost 17.And yes, I pay for my own gas to drive dear auntie around. My dad, the one who called me a spoiled bitch, raised me not to expect anything to just be handed to me. If I were out of gas on a back road, he would leave me there and tell me to figure it out. (This is from experience.)"
461,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling my family that my husband is transgender?,21557,ih5qua,516,"My husband is a transgender man, therefore he cannot get me pregnant. We agreed before we even got married that we wanted to adopt, and we're a couple years into the process right now, and are probably a couple years off being able to adopt kids. We told my parents that we want to adopt, but have never told them he is trans, because we didn't think they'd accept it. They are aware of our adoption plans and have asked us if we'd seen a fertility specialist when we said we couldn't have kids, and we said we haven't seen one because we want to adopt.For our anniversary a couple days ago, my parents told us they've prepaid for a consultation at a fertility clinic. They've put down £200 just for the initial consultation and another £120 for a semen culture  (I already have a son from a previous relationship so they know I'm not the problem). They've prepaid for it, and sent us an invoice from the clinic confirming that the consultation and test have both been paid for. They've also paid for train tickets (£108) for us to get to the clinic. My husband then decided to come out to them as transgender and explain exactly why he couldn't have a semen culture done (no semen). \[Edit: to be clear, he chose to tell them, and he told them himself, I didn't ""out"" him\]Since telling them, all hell has broken loose. They're furious we didn't tell them sooner, said they have a right to know who they were ""allowing"" into their family, and are fuming that they've put down money for a consultation/test we won't be having. They want an apology for not telling them sooner, and a refund on the £428 they paid out, as they say they wouldn't have put that money down if they'd known that we already knew exactly why we couldn't have kids ""the old fashioned way"" (as my dad put it).I've said we didn't ask them to put that money down and it was disrespectful of them to do so when they know we want to adopt, and it shouldn't matter to them whether my husband is cis or trans.However, they feel that they are owed an apology for hiding the truth and expect us to refund the £428 they paid out, as they would not have paid it out if they knew the truth.We think we might be TA because they were coming from a good place and honestly we probably should have told them sooner.Are we TA for not telling/refunding them?\[Edit: I have no intention of engaging with transphobic rhetoric. Questions are fine because I believe that people should be able to ask questions, provided that those questions are not coming from a place of hate (and I will give the benefit of the doubt in most cases) (and ofc I won't argue with judgement about this aspect of the question unless it's transphobic). Any transphobic comments, however, will be reported and the author will be blocked, rather than giving those viewpoints my attention, which they don't deserve.\]"
462,Not the A-hole,AITA for being offended that my daughter called me ugly?,21557,iwzdfp,2193,"This isn’t a big deal, but I feel like I’m going crazy over it. Yesterday at dinner, my daughter (15f) was telling my wife (40f) and I (45m) about a guy she likes in school and she thinks he likes her back. My wife and I were happy for her and I would support her liking anyone that treats her right and makes her happy. She was telling us how he’s smart, funny, and has a great 6-pack (I’m used to the girl talk). My wife laughed and said something along the lines of, “as long as he’s a good person”. My daughter replied, “Well yeah, but looks are also important. I don’t want to end up with someone like daddy.” I asked her what she meant by that. I don’t remember her exact words but it was along the lines of that I’m round, bald and short. There was no immediate just kidding from her. I told her that that wasn’t a nice thing to say to and that she should apologize. Before she said anything though, my wife chimed in teasing that guys were always so sensitive. My daughter laughed. I usually would immediately address this kind of situation, but I was pretty upset and didn’t want to scream or cry (I know that’s so lame). I stayed mostly silent for the rest of dinner. A bit of background, I’ve recently been feeling more self conscious. I’m not ugly (even if I was, I have other qualities to make up for it!) and I know that my wife adores me, but I’ve definitely noticeably gained some weight and lost some hair. My wife is as stunning and youthful as the day I met her, and my daughter is the spitting image of her. However, I have a feeling that if my daughter insulted her appearance she would be very offended and expect me to back her up. Before bed, I addressed the issue with my wife. I explained that it hurt my feelings, that I want to teach my daughter to be kind to others, and that it would mean a lot if we could both talk to my daughter about why saying that was not right. My wife didn’t take me seriously at all. Among the things she said was that the best way to make someone stop teasing you is to ignore it (I don’t want to treat my daughter like a middle school bully!), and that she (my wife) was also materialistic at that age but grew out of it on her own. She also said that I was asking for it by asking her what she meant. I told my wife that I was disappointed in her and I would be talking to my daughter alone when she comes home from school today. I plan on talking to my daughter today, both because I’m still offended and I really dont want her to say that to anyone else. I don’t plan on punishing her, just having an honest conversation and seeing where it goes. Nonetheless, I’m partially wondering if I’m the asshole for escalating the situation since it’s a one-off occurrence?"
463,Not the A-hole,AITA for not making my son share is gaming PC?,21537,g3q3tg,2271,"I am 45F and my Husband 50M has a 16-year-old son. He is a good kid, good grades, respectful, does his chores, etc. Last Summer my son said that he wanted a new computer. To his credit, he got a part-time job and saved up for it, and built a pretty nice gaming PC. We are really proud of him, as he saved for it nearly all summer.My sister and her husband have recently moved in with us. They have a 9-year-old son. My sister has a history of IDK how to put it, being entitled. She thinks her kid can do no wrong and spoils her kid.Well when they came over, my nephew noticed my son's PC. He asked if he can play on it, my son said not now. That was the end of it for a couple of days. Again, my nephew wanted to play on it. I asked my son if he minded sharing, he said he would rather not since its expensive and doesn't want it to break. This has caused a big argument. My sister says its extremely unfair to my nephew because he doesn't have a system to play on, just his iPad, so my son should have to share. I told her it's his PC not mine, he paid for it so it's up to him. She then accused me of being a 'spineless parent'. I said I'm not, but I'm not going to force my son to share his own computer. My nephew ended up having a huge fit, which she then blamed me for his fit, but gave him 3 more hours of iPad time to quiet him down.Its been 4 days and my sister hasn't brought it up directly again, just being passive-aggressive. While on one hand, I don't want to make my kid share, because it's his computer, he saved up for it and I don't feel it would be the right thing to do, to force my kid to share. On the other hand, I do feel kinda bad for my nephew, AITA?Edit: I went to bed with probably less than a 100 comments, and now my inbox is 1,500 full. There is no way I can read them all so thank you to everyone, and I have an update. I showed my sister this post, I guess a bad idea in hindsight, she was pissed and screamed at me at my son. My husband told her to GTFO."
464,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling a friend he shouldn’t get a job in a field he wants and that his attitude is horrible.,21544,izofp3,1404,"I (F27) am a librarian at an inner city location. One of the most fundemental parts of the library is that it is for everyone- the CEO to the janitor. Anyone is welcome. In my location that does mean we will get homeless people. That is FINE. If they are causing a disturbance they will be asked to leave just like anyone else, but otherwise come on in! My area also has an opioid problem, and the library will see overdoses every once in a while. I have administered naloxone twice in the three years at my job. We do community outreach to try and combat this. One of my friends has recently expressed interest in becoming a librarian. I was telling him all about school (masters degrees are becoming more and more require, it was for me), jobs, etc, and how the library has become a real community resource for those in need the past few decades. He asked what I meant by that and I told him pretty much what I said above. He said that that’s disgusting and that he wouldn’t allow people like that to come into the library, and that the library should be for “good people only”. I was shocked! I’ve never known this side of my friend. I bluntly told him that if that’s how he thinks, the job isn’t for him and that his attitude was a horrible one to have. Well, he blew up at me and then made some vague statements on social media about “people who try and ruin your goals”. A mutual friend reached out and said I was being rude. I really don’t think I was in the wrong here. Honestly, I feel crazy. Was I wrong to tell him that? AITA?EDIT- He’s specially interested in being a public librarian.SECOND EDIT-  I’ve been getting a lot of comments and messages on this. Yes, many librarians have masters degrees, and most positions will require you to have one. My specific masters is in archive preservation, but I made the switch because I wanted to work with the public. Librarians do much more than checking out materials or telling a 7 year old where the Magic Treehouse books are. You do budgeting, research, program development, teach classes, a million and one other things. Children’s librarians do even more. There is nitty gritty stuff here. It is a professional field.FINAL (?) EDIT- Please stop messaging me for my location. I’m on the upper east coast of the states, that’s all I feel comfortable saying.Another edit- It appears people think I condone drug use in the library. I do not. If you are found doing drugs you are banned. I am prepared for the side effects of doing drugs, namely an overdose."
465,Not the A-hole,AITA for yelling at my roommate’s girlfriend because she hid my credit card and then claimed it was for my betterment?,21531,kbtrtv,1107,"I (M25) live with my close friend, Josh (also M25) and his girlfriend, Anna (F22). It used to be only Josh and I until the lockdown started back in March and Anna permanently moved in. I get along okay with Anna but we’re not super close. I guess that establishes the group dynamics. Yesterday, I couldn’t find my credit card. Josh and I searched the entire apartment for two fucking hours but we couldn’t find it. Then walks in Anna, after her evening walk, and goes ‘what are y’all upto’ to which I ask her if she’s seen my credit card. She straight up says that yep, she has it. I was like what the fuck are YOU doing with my credit card? To which she said that I shouldn’t worry as she didn’t intend to use my card, she only took it to help with my *addiction*. What addiction? She thinks I’m a ‘shopaholic’ and that I buy way too much useless shit. She saw some movie the night before where the protagonist had this condition and shopped herself into a crazy debt. That movie reminded her of me. She said, I quote ,’*You’re not there yet but you will be if someone doesn’t intervene.*’I was pissed off at this point because A. I do not have a shopping problem. And even if I did, I am using MY money that I work hard for to buy things I like. She’s absolutely no one to try to poke her nose into my business and B. her having my card meant that she came inside my room, snooped through my stuff until she found the card, which is a gross violation of my privacy. So I asked, rather loudly, to stay the fuck away from my things and that I would fucking call the cops on her if she ever tried pulling a stunt like this again. Josh was not aware of her stealing and he’s siding with me. But Anna’s trying to convince him that her intentions were pure and that I’m grossly overreacting and being a dick to her. AITA?"
466,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling a bunch of random women I’m gay?,21507,fplopc,1188,"So I (23M, turning 24 soon) am gay. I’ve been out since I was 18 and I’ve never hidden it, but I don’t like actively mention it or broadcast it cos it’s literally nobody’s business. The first person I came out to was my dad (40) and he has always been supportive of me. He was 16 when I was born and practically raised me as a single dad so we have an exceptionally close relationship. Anyway onto the story.My dad recently turned 40, only earlier this month. He had a huge party and drank a bit too much and was severely hungover the following morning. He’s a freelance photographer and had accepted a contract with a local business and was meant to hand in some photography work he’d done to them the morning after his birthday. He was too hungover to do so, so he asked if I’d do it, he called their office to tell them he was sending his son with the work and I went in.Everything was fine and I ended up meeting a bunch of people he’s currently working with. They knew I was my dad’s son as he talks about me with them. I got some conversation with them to be nice and a few of the younger women started I guess flirting with me? A few of them called me attractive and stuff like that and I kinda just stood there awkwardly. It was just wild that straight women were hitting on me. I didn’t encourage it or anything but I didn’t say anything as I was too embarrassed and I eventually said I had to run and off I went.My dad went in the day after and he was questioned about if I was single. He said no, I wasn’t and that I had a boyfriend and that was all he said. Well, turns out these women then started blatantly calling me for an AH as I apparently let them embarrass themselves by openly hitting on me when there was no chance I’d ever be interested. My dad did fight my corner and said that I was literally there to just drop off his work and that I had no obligation to disclose I was gay.I’m thankful my dad’s on my side but these women calling me an AH kinda makes me feel bad for not saying anything.AITA?"
467,Not the A-hole,AITA for letting my date pay for dinner?,21494,c6hnjh,6860,"I [19M] asked a girl [18F] out to dinner. When it was time to pay, she said ""I got it"" and went into her purse. At that point I literally had the receipt thing in my hand. I thanked her and handed it to her. She hesitated a bit, but she paid and we went home happy (or so I thought).So from my perspective I really can't see what I did wrong here. From asking her out until receiving the check, I intended to pay. After she offered to pay, I thanked her and allowed her to pay.The next day I woke up to angry texts. She said I put her into an awkward position, forcing her to pay the bill. I asked what she wanted me to do differently. Apparently I should have argued/insisted that I would pay. My friends agree with her. Now I'm wondering if I should just apologize and pay her back.AITA?"
468,Not the A-hole,AITA for not allowing my husband to be the entire neighborhood's husband?,21476,ipd06m,3453,"I have a weird situation. It's become very clear that my husband is the only man on our street. The rest of the houses are entirely women. There's a few single mother houses, 2 houses of all female roommates, one single woman, and even a lesbian couple.I normally wouldn't care or even take note of this, but since March, it's like we're getting constant calls and texts. The number we gave when we moved in two years ago (just renewed last January) was my number. I am FLOODED with requests for basic handyman stuff like changing light bulbs, car problems, and dealing with toilets.He has helped people around the neighborhood before because he is a nice guy and we are from a culture that assumes that men need to ""help out"" women if they can, even if they're not related. But with me being furloughed, he's the only one working and is less interested in extra stuff, but the tasks do only take about 5-20 minutes on average, which I know because my husband makes me go with him because they make him uncomfortable.  Even more gross than that is that these women are obsessed with him on a personal level. They openly flirt with him and literally offer themselves up if he's ""ever tired of [me]"" or ""wants something different"". I have even gotten pictures of boobs from neighbors! While I love my husband and am attracted to him, he's not like a male model or anything so I really don't understand why these women are fawning over him like this. One of the single moms has even asked him to come over and discipline one of her children, which is an absolute nope. He's not comfortable with any of this and has asked me to intervene. I've tried talking to these women more casually to no avail. I set up a zoom for just us ladies to try to get us on the same page. They told me that since it's now impossible for any of them to find anyone anymore (2020), I needed to share my husband and be less selfish in regards to household maintenance requests.  It's ""not even safe"" to call for maintenance and I shouldn't ask them to when there's a ""safe alternative"" where they don't have to risk exposure.  They also said that it was just ""harmless flirting"" because they're all ""frustrated* and can't date"" and that I wouldn't even be threatened by it if I was ""giving him kids"". I've talked to my own family about this and while they say that the women should be less forward, I should be more understanding about how hard it is for a woman to be alone because my own mother was alone. AITA for not just dealing with it? *I'm substituting frustrated for the word that was actually used to make this slightly more family friendly."
469,Not the A-hole,AITA for holding a text (I read by snooping) against my dad and stepmom for 6 years now?,21470,laxxdo,2074,"When I was 13, I was using my dad's phone and I was dumb and very clearly wrong when I opened a text that popped up from my stepmom. She was a few months pregnant at the time.A few texts up I saw that my dad had sent a text saying:""Alice (my mom) is being a bitch again. I'm so glad I get to have a baby with someone I actually love.""To which my stepmom replied:""And I can't wait to have a kid without her awful genes mixed in.""Which my dad found very funny based on his response.The reason I remember these texts so clearly is because I sent a copy of them to my mom. I knew my dad and mom hated each other. But I felt extremely insulted and betrayed by the texts because they directly involved me.I refused to stay at my dad's house ever since and when my dad took my mom to court, I told the judge that I can't live with him anymore. My dad and stepmom spent a very long time apologizing. He does seem genuinely sorry because he has cried in front of me.But I can't really bring myself to forgive him. I also know I shouldn't have snooped. But I can't unsee those texts.AITA?"
470,Not the A-hole,AITA for terrorising my roommates into cleaning up their crap?,21457,hasst0,724,"So I live with two roommates (28m & 21f) who are less than helpful when it comes to cleaning the house. Wet clothes are left in the washer for days on end, food is left rotting in the fridge and in the sink for several weeks if I do not clean it, they also just casually throw garbage into the yard. If asked nicely multiple times for them to clean their mess and even not so nicely a few times. I am far from the most hygienic person in the world myself, I’ll leave dishes until the next day and just general untidiness but they take it to a different level. All this filth (since my refusal to clean it anymore) has brought some new roommates for us, mainly giant ass rats! Which seem to have moved into our yard. The kicker is, they are both ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED of rats. A plan soon hatched in my mind and with a bit of creativity, some invisible thread and an old bristle broom, I now had a “faux rat” (I named him Ronald)Every few days or so for the past 2weeks ish I have been placing it in the corner of the kitchen, waiting for one of them to walk in. Then I yank Ronald as hard as I can at an angle so he shoots towards them. Each time they’ve ran from the kitchen screaming in fear. I won’t lie I very much enjoyed doing it at first but kinda felt guilty at having made a grown man bawl his eyes out and thought the lesson has probably been learned. So I decided  we had to have a house meeting about the infestation and how they don’t feel safe in the home anymore (personally I didn’t feel safe with a pan of veggie rice rotting on the countertop for 12days but hey ho!).I simply stated that if they’re just cleaned up their junk the rats would most likely disappear. Lo and behold the place was spotless within an hour and since then there has been a lot less mess. Ronald has been put into retirement and is resting in my bedroom ready to pounce if ever needed again. But did I take it too far?"
471,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my mom she's the reason I don't want any kids?,21449,dshdji,2703,"I (23F) am the oldest of 4 siblings. My dad passed away when I was 14, leaving us and my mom. There's a bit of an age gap between me and my siblings. So when my dad passed my mom looked at me for babysitting duties. Walking them to school, getting them ready in the morning, cooking for them, helping them with homework, getting them in bed at the right time, all that. If I had to guess I'd say I spend 4 hours a day minimum taking care of them, most days more. Plus an hour or so on chores. Now I love my siblings, and I love my mom. But from when I was 14 till I moved out at 19 I had no social life, no hobbies, barely any friends. All there was was taking care of them, chores, school, and from 16 to later work too. I'm on good terms with my mom, we meet for coffee about twice a month to catch up. I've been in a steady relationship for over 2.5 years, so whenever we meet my mom brings up marriage and kids. I've politely told her I don't want any of that yet, possibly ever, so she can stop asking. When she kept pushing (spread out over several visits after I told her to stop asking) i told her ""Giving up my youth to take care of someone else's kids because they couldn't ruined the idea of having kids myself for me."" I didn't mean to be rude, but it's true. She cried. I told her I don't blame her, but that it still wasn't a good position to be put in as a teen. I didn't apologise. AITA?Edit: When I said ""taking care of someone else's kids because they couldn't"" I wasn't trying to be malicious. A) She at that moment in time, genuinely couldn't, which is why I had to. B) I called them 'someone else's kids' because they don't feel like siblings anymore, I had to carry way too much responsibility to just feel like a big sister. I wasn't trying to be mean about it, but that's why I said it that way.Edit 2: Yes, I'm aware my mom struggled too, lost her partner, had to work. I was there. I never said I don't sympathise or that it was easy for her. I'm sympathetic to my mom's situation, but that doesn't change the fact that my teenage years where very tough, and I don't want kids because of that.Edit 3: For the people PMing and commenting about how it's my fault I didn't have friends and not my mom's: I wasn't allowed to bring friends home, my mom was scared it would distract me from watching my siblings.Last edit: For everyone asking, my mom worked 9-6:30.Actually the last edit: My mom came home around 6:30, that didn't mean I only watched the kids till 06:30. I usually was the one who cooked dinner and put them to bed, my mom was tired after work."
472,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling my wife a “helicopter mom” after she called the place my son applied at?,21443,ltjv80,1973,"My son James just turned 16 this month and he decided he wanted to start working a part time job. Just to have some extra spending money and to start saving up. He hasn’t had much luck, I doubt many places are interested in hiring a teen with limited hours to work. James started to get annoyed with my wife after he found out she submitted a few applications for him.We had a whole talk about that and reminded her that James wants to do this job hunting on his own. Over a week ago James applied a this local clothing store he likes to shop at since he’s familiar with the place. He was told the usual line when he spoke to the hiring manager: “We’ll review your application and give you a call.” He was really hoping to get this one but after a week, he figured they were not gonna call. Earlier when I got home there was some tension. James was locked in his room and my wife seemed upset. I spoke to him first and he told me my wife called the store earlier and berated the hiring manager for giving my son “false hope” and lying to him about giving him a call when they clearly weren’t going to.James heard the call from upstairs because she was yelling and when he confronted my wife she said she was just angry on his behalf. That they should’ve called him anyways to let him know he didn’t get the job. But obviously they are only going to call applicants they actually plan to hire.He’s angry at my wife right now for interfering and now he’s going to be too embarrassed to go to that store again since they know who he is. I also confronted my wife and she kept saying she was only looking out for him. However good her intentions were, I told her she needed to stop being a helicopter mom here or she could ruin opportunities for him by interfering. My wife when to our room and shut the door. James wants an apology from her for embarrassing him, my wife says she did nothing wrong and is mad at me for calling her that. She said I was the one being an ass for not caring if our son finds a job and it’s not fair for me to criticize her when she at least gives a damm. With the way she’s being right now, I have to ask if maybe I went too far and was an asshole for calling her a helicopter mom."
473,Not the A-hole,AITA for buying my daughter toys and refusing for my niece? My sister is acting entitled about it all saying horrible things,21439,id7k26,1137,"My husband Dean (29) and I (26F) have a wonderful little girl Lisa and she’s 4. I’m a musician by trade so my work has pretty much stopped and my husband has been working a lot the past few months. I’m basically at home all the time with Lisa and she is missing her dad a lot as she’s his double and 100% a daddy’s girl.Anyway, I met up with my sister Rose (32) recently and we ended up visiting a toy store. I saw this male doll which looked a lot like Dean and I decided to buy it for Lisa so that she’d always have an reminder of her daddy. Rose was miffed by this and demanded I buy my niece Flora (also 4) a doll. For years Rose has been trying to basically force me to treat her daughter the same or better than my own. Here are some examples of her behaviour.  There’s only five months between the girls and I’ve had to deal with Rose being weird about that fact for years and during my pregnancy. Lisa is my second daughter as I had a stillborn daughter in late 2014 at 20 and it broke me. Rose witnessed this and when she announced her pregnancy, she was horrible and said that she was expecting the first Grandchild saying my daughter didn’t count as she died whilst our parents and family said it was the second grandchild. Then, when I got pregnant again Rose was weird about it saying I shouldn’t have gotten pregnant so quickly and accused me of stealing her thunder of the “new grandchild.” There’s been some other occasions where she just expects our kids to share everything or make everything about Flora for being the first grandchild and I’ve just had to put up with it.Anyway, Rose kept on insisting and I just snapped and said “no. I am sick of you pushing your kid onto me and basically making my one take a backseat. I’m buying MY kid a doll literally to make her happy cos she’s missing her daddy. Buy your own kid a fucking toy.” I ended up buying the toy and walking off. She went tattling to our parents adding dramatic flair to the story calling me a massive bitch for refusing to buy my niece a toy. My dad is in my side saying I’ve had to put up with her glorifying her kid for years whilst ignoring mine whilst my mom thinks I should give into her. My husband says he’s sick of Rose and She even brought up my dead daughter again saying “she’d be ashamed of her mommy.” That reduced me to tears and I told her she’s dead to me but my mum insists I apologise TO ROSE.Edit the girls weren’t with us"
474,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to cook for my boyfriend's daughter even though she had a breakdown?,21418,jnty42,2565,"I have been dating this guy, Mark, who has a 14 year old kid, Jennifer for a while now. I have only met her a couple of times, so we aren't that close. I started seeing her often after I moved in with Mark (during his custody time). We get along fine and I think we are bonding well. There is just one issue. Since I grew up in poverty, I hate wasting food. Jennifer has an issue with food. I am not talking about being a little cranky when hungry. She would cry and scream and even break things if dinner gets delayed by half an hour. During her last visit, work was very hectic for me and Mark. Mark had to go to office while I WFH. Since I knew how busy I would be end of day and how Jennifer gets, I woke up early prepare breakfast, lunch and dinner. I informed her the same. End of day, I am in so many meeting and calls and Jennifer barged in 15 past her dinner time and told me serve her dinner. I reminded her that the dinner was in the fridge and all she had to do was heat it up. She comes back 15 mins later and told me that she threw the food away and now she wanted me to give her a snack for the time being and make her something else. I told her that I am not going to do that and then locked myself inside the study. I could hear her screaming and crying and I refused to give in. Once my work was done (2 hours later), she was still crying. She never heated the dinner. She tried it cold, didn't like it, threw the ENTIRE dinner for 3 away and then started demanding me for a freshly cooked dinner. She begged me to cook her something and I told her that I already did cook her something and that she threw it away. I told her she can either cook for herself or wait until her father comes home and he can cook for her.I went to bed hungry as I was so tired. Next day, Mark told me that he didn't get home until midnight and she was still sobbing when he arrived. Although he agrees that Jennifer was acting entitled, he also says that I should have just cooked her something once my work was done as I knew about her food issues instead of letting her cry for hours. I got pissed off and told him that I am not cooking for either of them anymore.AITA here?Edit: She isn't diagnosed with anything."
475,Not the A-hole,"AITA for being a ""Karen"" about my car being ""fixed""?",21390,clx62w,2153,"My car was shaking when I braked from high speeds, my dad told me it was the rotors and I believed him but the deal I got the car from has free diagnostic so I took it there. So my dad was right, it was the rotors. My friend had just done the brake pads like a month ago but not the rotors. So the dealer guy said it'll be 650 to get all four rotors shaved down and an oil change (synthetic oil so oil change is like 90 bucks itself). I said ok. He calls me like an hour later and says his guy started cutting the front rotors and it wasn't gonna work so they needed to replace all 4 four 850. I asked if they cut the backs ones yet and he said no. I specially said *do not* cut the backs ones ""do as little as possible"". He calls me again and says his guy cut a back rotor and it wasn't gonna work so I needed to replace those too as it was too uneven now. I said I told you not to cut those and he was like ""I was just tryna to help you out""I'm fuming at this point, go to pick up my car. It's 750 for the two front rotors and the oil change (when they had quoted me 850 for all 4 and the oil change?!). I pay and leave. My car is literally not drivable  it's so shaky. I bring it back and tell him the car is dangerous at this point and it needs to be fixed. We get into and he's like I'll do the back rotors for free labor but it's 200 for the rotors. I tell him I'll get a lawyer cause I'm not giving him literally another penny, I paid 750 for a car that's worse than before. I ask for the manager and eventually they agree that it was their fuck up and they'll eat the back rotors. Pick the car up the next day and it's good. I told my parents and they said they're proud of me but my one friend said I was a ""karen""AITA?"
476,Not the A-hole,"AITA for inviting my brother to my wedding, but not his wife?",21385,i6d0ru,2207,"I’m engaged. My fiancée is fat. She was when I met her. I’ve always found her irresistibly sexy. Not looking for commentary or unsolicited advice on this point. My fiancée and I sent out save the dates for the wedding. My brother got one, his wife very intentionally did not. He got married last year. His wife had all my siblings’ significant others as bridesmaids, whether they were married or dating. Even my (other) brother’s girlfriend who he’d only been with for a few months. I’d been with my girlfriend for nearly five years at that point and everyone knew it was a question of when, not if, we’d get married. She didn’t ask my girlfriend to be a bridesmaid because she didn’t want to be constrained to picking a bridesmaids dress available in plus sizes and did not want to have my girlfriend in her wedding photos. I’m not speculating. That’s not something I ever could’ve guessed. That’s what she said, in her own words, when we arrived at the wedding to find everyone else’s SOs were bridesmaids but her, and asked what was going on. I thought maybe it was a Bridezilla moment and she’d realize how hurtful it was later, but it’s been over a year, and while my brother has apologized again and again for ever having allowed that to happen (why he’s invited), his wife never did at all. Even when it’s been brought up in front of her. We’ve only seen them a couple times since the wedding, and my fiancée has tried to forgive and forget, but it’s still uneasy between us because of the singular lens we now know she views my fiancée through. My fiancée doesn’t mind grinning and bearing for the occasional family event we have to attend, but I didn’t feel like it would be right to make her spend her wedding day with someone who would ever treat her as less than human. We’re having a very intimate wedding, (20 people and 12 are family.) Having that woman there would taint the whole dynamic. That being said, the rest of my family is understandably upset. My family, my brother especially, feel like we’re trying to make them choose sides. (In my other brother’s words “Even if that wasn’t your intention, it’s the result, and that’s a real asshole move none of us deserve. *We* didn’t do anything to [your fiancée].” I definitely don’t want to make anyone choose sides, and he’s not wrong that they didn’t cause the problem and don’t deserve the fallout. But my wife also deserves a wedding day with only people who love and cherish her.  AITA for not inviting my brother’s wife?"
477,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my parents that they shouldn’t have had three kids?,21374,fzepe8,1342,"I’m (23F) the youngest in my family with two older sisters, A (27F) and M (26F). In general, I’ve always felt my sisters were raised differently than me. They’re only a year and ten months apart, so they were only one grade apart in school and much closer than they were with me growing up. They got to do all the same activities together, hung out with the same friend groups, and got to travel together once they were both in college. However, I was just the ‘little sister’ that they didn’t want around growing up. For instance, I was literally kicked out of the house during M’s 16th birthday because I was still in middle school and they thought it’d be weird if I was there at the party (still had to clean up their mess when the party was over!). Anyway, my sisters got to do a lot of cool activities that I didn’t get to do when I was growing up. They got to do ice skating, horseback riding lessons, all these cool summer camps, etc. Growing up, all I did was sit at their lessons and wait for them to be over. The only activity I had was tennis for a year and a half before my parents canceled it. When my sisters left for college, my parents kind of checked out and didn’t really care I was still in high school. I was pretty much just doing everything on my own. When they got older, my dad bought A three cars (over the course of 5 years) and my mom bought M a car. When I was old enough to drive, my parents said they didn’t have enough money to buy me a car, so I had to finance my first car. My parents even helped them out with rent during college, car insurance, and any other expense. However, I have been pretty much supporting myself since I was 17. Today, my sisters are both married with kids. A has two kids and M has one. My mom looks after all the kids while my sisters are working. Meanwhile, I’m in grad school very far away from my family. Anyway, my mom has been complaining how she can’t handle watching 3 kids under the age of 2 at the same time, and has been bugging me to quit school to come help out watching the kids, which pissed me off because it feels like it’s just me revolving my life around my sisters again. She was also pointing out how A has saved up enough money to buy a house which they don’t see me doing at  her age cause I haven’t been saving as much as her (A was living at home until 3 months ago and didn’t pay for anything).That’s when I pretty much snapped and told her that maybe if they treated me equally as them financially, then perhaps I’d be buying a house at 27 as well. She started going on about how it was difficult raising 3 kids, and I told her that she shouldn’t have 3 kids if she couldn’t handle it and treat all 3 equally. My mom got really upset and hung up the phone and hasn’t really reached out to me since. I do feel kind of bad now though because they did provide me food and shelter growing up."
478,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my dad his favorite Christmas memory is one of my least favorite?,21375,kjxszn,1024,"I need to hear from others on this.When I (21f) was 8 my mom died. Two years later he was married again. That first Christmas after he remarried I asked my dad if we could spend a few hours Christmas Eve at the lake we used to go to every year with my mom, just the two of us. He said sure but then brought his wife and her two kids along and we spent it together. I was so upset and mad and it ruined the intention of going, to have one last moment where I felt like it was just the three of us--not really but it brought a closeness when we went there just the two of us and I wanted it one last time. I always made it known it wasn't what I wanted and my dad knew I was mad. But he always talked about how that was one of his favorite Christmas memories because it brought back our first family Christmas. I always wondered if he was talking like that to try and convince me that I felt the same way because he always ignored my feelings on it.Anyway, I was talking to him for a little while yesterday and he brought up the memory again and I asked him to stop. He told me he didn't know what I meant and I told him the memory might have been his favorite Christmas memory but I hated it and I did not look back fondly on it. He asked me how I could hate the memory of the first Christmas we had as a family with his wife and her kids. I told him because I had wanted one last Christmas memory of just the two of us. I said even an hour would have been better but he ruined it by including them. He said he thought I understood why they were included and I said no, he just didn't want to accept that I was mad about it. He told me it was important to cement family bonds and I told him if I could I would gladly forget that memory. He got mad and told me I didn't need to try and shame him for loving that memory. I told him I just wanted him to stop bringing it up to me.He's demanding an apology and he told me I am selfish for saying a memory was ruined because we included our family. I told him he would never understand and I hung up on him. He messaged me after and told me he still wants the apology and for me to get over myself. AITA?"
479,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my girlfriend her hate for babies is pathetic and doesn't make her cool or edgy?,21369,at578d,1187,"I (18m) have been dating my gf (19) for about four months. We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. However, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like ""she's dirty"", ""kids are all feral"" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. Recently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. This really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. Also at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.On the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of ""kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is"". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. "
480,Not the A-hole,AITA For no longer allowing my sister to work in my daycare after what she did?,21363,lrjt9t,1894,Hi. I'm a 32year old widow. Have been for 3y. I struggled a lot financially. I didn't get help from my family because they claim they can't so I decided to start a home daycare. Its been open for 7 months now. My friend was able to get me more clients via Facebook. thank Goodness my business is growing and I've made quite a lot of friends who are moms and also established good reputation since my daycare has been recommended.My sister (26) is unemployed. Didn't find a job yet and had rent to pay for her and her boyfriend. My parents suggested I let her come work with me at my daycare and accepted since she has experience in the past. I agreed to let her come and earn her living. She got along with the other workers and things were going fine. Until she came to me asking about a specific child that comes to our daycare. He's 4. Very well behaved for his age. I was confused after she complained about him. She said she saw his dad come over to pick him up and didn't feel comfortable when she saw him because he's a Police Officer and she had an unpleasant incident with the police (bc of something her boyfriend did) that she needed therapy for and struggled alot from. She wanted me to let the child go and tell the parent to look for another daycare. He usually arrives at 3pm to pick the kid up. From what I understand his wife's sick. I refused. I've no good reason to let the child go. My sister refused to drop it and started being mean to the dad. It was unprofessional of her. I told her she either be respectful or I won't have her work with me anymore. 2d ago she sent an email to the dad telling him we won't be welcoming his kid at the daycare anymore. He came to talk to me and I was livid when I saw the email. he asked why and talked about his kid wanting to stay bc he's friends with other kids. Talked about not being able to find a daycare closer than ours. I lashed out at my sister and I told her she's no longer able to work at the daycare because of her behavior. We got into an argument and she left after saying I was being unsupportive and inconsiderate.My parents called me saying I shouldn't have kicked my sister out and now causing her to lose her apartment. They argued I have no regard for my sister' 'trauma' & I should've let the child go and support her bc she's my sister. Everyone shamed me and claimed I had messed up priorities. I felt i was in the wrong for letting her struggle now without a job but I have no reason to let go of the child as well.He wears a uniform. My aunt suggested that I ask him to get someone else to come and pick up his kid orAt least I let her leave before 3pm. And arrive abit late in the morning. But others would notice the difference in treatment at the daycare.I understand that there are parents struggling and I do all I can to help out and be supportive. Yes she's my younger sister but treating people like that was unprofessional of her.One thing to clarify. My sister's boyfriend is in no-contact with my family due to issues. However they said they want to support my sister and be in contact with her and support her although they don't have a relationship with her boyfriend. That's why they keep pressuring me to help and support her.
481,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to take my stepsister along on a family trip that my fiancé is paying for?,21361,i8xuiq,3696,"I've changed some details because I’m pretty sure my stepsister uses reddit.When I was 11 my mom married my stepdad who also had a 13-year-old daughter. For the purpose of this post we’ll call her Emma. Me and Emma have never gotten along, when I was 22 I finally went no contact with her.The straw that finally broke the camel’s back was when she gleefully announced she was pregnant with my then fiancé…. On Christmas day. That was honestly one of the worst times in my life and it took me a really long time to recover from the betrayal. Emma ended up marrying my ex and they have a little boy together.I’m currently 28 and engaged to a wonderful man, who is a lot better than my ex ever was. Emma and my ex ended up divorcing after 3 years and she now lives with my mom and stepdad.My fiancé has family in Italy who he’d like me (and my parents) to meet before the wedding. The original plan was to go this summer but obviously with COVID our plans got put on hold. I was discussing the plans to reschedule for next year with my mom recently and she asked me if I was going to invite Emma and her son along. I told her I wasn’t and she asked me to reconsider because she didn’t think my stepdad would come otherwise (that’s fine with me, its really my mom and dad that my fiancé wants to introduce to his family). She argued Emma has matured since becoming a mom and getting divorced and that she wants to attempt to have a relationship with me.When I told her I wasn’t interested she said I was putting her in an awkward position and that I was taking my half-sister and stepbrother on my dad's side so she felt like I was favouring him (my stepbrother is literally the person who introduced me to my fiancé and my half-sister and I are close). She also said it’s unfair because Emma could never afford a trip like this on her own and my nephew would be the one to miss out on bonding time with his cousins.She asked me to reconsider before she left and has only replied to my texts to ask if I’d changed my mind. I’m starting to feel guilty because I know mine and Emma’s dislike for one another has put a massive strain on my mom’s marriage and it’s not fair to her. My mom’s sisters have also called me to ask me to change my mind. I’m starting to worry my mom might not come either with how cold she’s being.My “full” sister has also reached out and told me Emma had been going to therapy and has realised that what she did was horrible and that I should consider forgiving her because she was going through a lot of her own issues (depression/low self-esteem) at the time and that my ex also made her suffer a lot too.Realistically, if she came on the trip, I could just avoid her the entire time, but I also don’t know if she has changed or if she’ll start up her old tricks again. My fiancé is also the one paying for the trip and I selfishly don’t want him to pay for her.AITA?Edit: I tried to read all of the comments but I have around 900+ unread messages so I thought I'd just answer some of the questions being asked repeatedly here:1. Did Emma ever apologise? No.2. Why are you taking your entire family to Italy? My fiancé wants to give our families the chance to get to know one another and he hopes they'll be as close as his parent's families are. Also, he thinks I'll be more comfortable with my family there as well instead of being ""thrown in the deep end"" with all of his family in a foreign country.Also, our parents have already met this is to meet his extended family (grandparents/aunts/uncles/cousins).3. Does your fiancé know/what is his opinion?He knows. I moved in with my dad shortly after everything went down and my fiancé was already close friends with my stepbrother so he used to hang out at my dad's place a lot so he saw the whole aftermath. He thinks the request is ridiculous but he has said he won't make the decision for me. My mom hasn't actually asked him despite threatening to but he has made it clear he'll make sure she knows he doesn't want my stepsister there. 4. Why won't/can't your mom just come on her own?This is just an assumption but I think she doesn't want to face my dad alone, they haven't had the best relationship after everything that went down.5. Can't your stepdad/mom pay for her and you just don't invite her to the family events?In theory, yes but we'll be staying with my fiancé's family so this may raise uncomfortable questions. If they want to get her a hotel and just not interact with my fiancé's family the whole time that's fine with me.Also, thank you for the awards!"
482,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my classmate use my artwork for her GoFundMe?,21355,g60p4a,2774,"I’m a senior in HS. In December one of my classmates got into a bad car accident that did a lot of damage. She had several surgeries, and is in need of more for her face. Her insurance won’t cover it, hence the GoFundMe. I was never friendly with this girl. She spread nasty rumors about a friend of mine, and I always had a tainted view of her. Outside of that incident I never talked to her, and didn’t know she knew that I existed. So my classmates are sending around a GoFundMe and a link to T-shirts for sale and I see that my artwork has been used! My artwork has nothing to do with her cause, it was a Picasso style self portrait that was an assignment for class. I posted it to twitter. They were using it on T-shirts and in promotions without my permission.I got into contact with the girl and her friend who is running everything and asked them to take my artwork off of their GoFundMe. At first they said that they didn’t know it was mine, and would credit me (they cropped my siggy out though...) I told them that I didn’t want it credited and preferred it to be taken down. The told me they already had T-shirts, people recognized it for her GoFundMe. I honestly didn’t care. Then they started guilt tripping me about it, and I told them I would go through other means to get it taken down. Then the girl posts screenshots of our DMs on her twitter, directing people at me, and telling them how heartless I am. I am getting tons of hate messages, and people telling me to just “let her use my shitty artwork.” I can’t even open up any social media without fear of getting shitty messages from my classmates.I talked to my mom about it and she thinks I should have just kept quiet about it as it’s hard not to look like an asshole for refusing to let her use the image. I’m feeling pretty confused, because I think I have the right to say where my artwork goes. AITA for not letting her use my art?"
483,Not the A-hole,AITA for singling someone out at a comedy show?,21353,d5t1e1,1671,"I do stand up. I also have a day job, because, you know, survival. I mentioned at work that I couldn’t do any shifts after 4:00 on Saturday because I had a show. My coworker overheard and asked for tickets so he could take a girl out without having to spend money. I had no problem helping him out and I knew this club wouldn’t care if I slid a couple people in. But I’ve been trying to get more bookings at this place and it’s kind of a level up from the sort of places I usually get to perform at so I told them, you know, “please make a point to laugh.”I’m up there doing my show and I see them and they’re the only ones in the relatively intimate audience who aren’t laughing. It bugs me a little but I didn’t want to lose my rhythm so just ignored them. Then I see that in this dark room that seats, max, forty people this guy is texting with his phone screen on full brightness. So I start telling a joke about a time I gave friends from work tickets to see me and they texted through the whole thing and as I’m doing it I’m slowly approaching their table (and the audience realizes I’m talking about these people at this show) yet he doesn’t notice or look up until I’m literally off the stage, approaching the foot of his table, staring at him. It killed, so that was the good part. But when I showed up to work I was expecting an apology from him. Instead HE was expecting an apology from me for (I’m quoting here) “inviting him out just to make him the butt of a joke” “making him look like a fool in front of his girl” and embarrassing him at a popular venue in our reasonably small town. He basically summarized it as “you’re supposed to be a professional and if you couldn’t handle me texting you shouldn’t be in show business.”I think, without question, that he’s the asshole. But he doesn’t believe me and the only people I could tell this story to and ask to confirm I’m not crazy and my real life friends, so, biased. Who’s the asshole?Edit: Clarity"
484,Not the A-hole,AITA for not paying for my siblings to go to uni?,21336,hmryph,1723,"I'm 29f, my siblings are 19f, 19f(twins) and 17m. About a year ago I won a rather large amount of money. Since then I paid off my mortgage, bought a rental home, paid for my parents to spent 2 months on holiday, paid off their mortgage and bought each of my younger siblings either a car or(in the case of my brother) a motorbike. I have recently started planning my wedding to my partner of 4 years. Originally we were going to have a very low budget wedding because neither of us were particularly wealthy and have little financial support from our parents(hers are homophobic and mine are just not well off enough to spend money on a wedding), but now we plan on having a slightly bigger wedding. However during these discussions my mother has been getting increasingly upset at the amount im spending(wedding will be around 40-50k all up including honeymoon and partner is contributing 12k, so its not like we're spending an astronomical amount), and has repeatedly suggested that we stick to our low budget plans and give money to her for my siblings college funds instead. These comments have been confusing me because she has told me in the past that she got 20k when I was born to put towards my college fund from her parents and then 10k for each of my siblings. I got though college on scholarships and my part time job so presumably she has 50k already for my siblings college fund.This came to a head about a week ago when she came with me to go to my fitting for my wedding dress and she saw the price tag($3k), she had a complete meltdown in the store about me wasting money and how she needed it and I confronted her about the college fund. She admitted that she and my dad had spent the money on trips away, alcohol and gambling a d now there was almost nothing left. I said if she wasted 50k meant for her children's college funds then why should I give her any more? At this point she stormed out after throwing her glass of wine on my dress(that cost $300 to clean) and has since said that she's not coming to my wedding and will stop my dad/siblings from coming. AITA here?"
485,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking for the gift receipt to return offensive baby clothes?,21335,dmrko9,3710,"Yesterday we had a baby shower. Long story short, one of our family friends thought it would be funny to get some baby onesies with offensive things written on them. For example: * ""All daddy wanted was a blow job"" * ""I'm with the milf"" * ""To-do list: Eat, poop, suck some titties"" There were like 2 more but I don't remember what they said. When I opened the gift I was humiliated, I thought it was really inappropriate. Before people on here give me shit about not being able to take a joke, I just didn't really think this was the funniest ""joke."" I was mad about the gift because as I was opening and before I could read what they said, I unfolded the onesie and showed the rest of the party. Some people gave let out a small chuckle, some people looked around at each other kinda surprised. Anyhow, at the end of the party, I asked the person who gave it to me if I could have the gift receipt to return them. I said I definitely wouldn't put my baby in those clothes. The person basically called me oversensitive and said I needed to take a joke. I handed the gift bag back to them and said ""Alright, well then you can keep these."" They were super offended by that and thought it was an ungrateful gesture. AITA?"
486,Not the A-hole,AITA for climbing in the window of my dad's house? He changed the locks to keep my mom (divorced) out but I was supposed to be at his house for the weekend.,21314,hth6d7,1272,"My parents are divorced, and because of the custody agreement I am supposed to be at my dad's for every other week. My mom dropped me off outside his house and I went to the door and the key didn't work. I banged on the door and rang the doorbell and nobody came to the door, the house seemed empty. My phone had died and my mom had left because she was dropping me off in her rush to work. The locks on the doors were new but it was hot as hell out and my dad was supposed to have custody so I thought it would be fine to come in the window. Like I was supposed to be there.I climbed in the bathroom window that he always leaves open, i slid the screen up carefully and came in without breaking anything. This is my childhood home, I've climbed in that window plenty of times, hell when I was little and playing outside I'd come through the window as a fun shortcut to use the bathroom.I went towards my bedroom and there was some random lady in the hallway who freaked out, she was scared by me being there and I was like ""I live here, I'm Mitch's daughter, who the hell are you"" and she left the house without saying. I went around the house and my dad was not there. (EDIT - A few people asked why I was so rude to say ""who the hell are you"" - it's because my dad has remarried, he has a wife who is away this month caring for her elderly parents... And I come home to see a random lady looking like she'd slept over the house coming out of my dad's room, wearing my dad's pajamas. It didn't look good, and that's why I was so angrily asking questions)So he got home and he was mad as hell at me for ""breaking in"" and scaring a lady he was friends with. Apparently my mom and him had miscommunicated about drop-off time, he was supposed to meet us in the afternoon and give me a copy of the new keys. It was supposed to be after his ""lady friend"" had left. And I was like ""ok so it was your mistake and my moms mistake, why are you mad at me for coming in rather than sitting out in 95 degree heat for who knows how long. And he was just so mad that I acted ""threatining"" to his ""friend"", that she was scared by me banging on the door and screaming then suddenly showing up inside the house when she had no idea who I was. I said that if he's having ladies over, and they're over a father's house, they better damn well expect a kid around it they're pretty dumb.AITA for climbing in the window of my dad's house?"
487,Not the A-hole,AITA for basically telling my ex girlfriend that she's not as hot as my current girlfriend?,21316,b9swi6,1704,"My ex (24f) and I (24m) dated 5 years ago. We were together for about a year, but then she dumped me out of no where for another guy and broke my heart. She and I shared the same circle of friends so I continued to be cordial with her for the sake of our friend group, and we remained friends until we graduated and I distanced her out of my life and no longer speak to her. I'm still close with my friend group, but they have drifted from her over the past year. I'll still see her sometimes when we have hang outs with the larger group, but I no longer speak to her and we just avoid each other.This past weekend my friend had a pre-game/party for his birthday and she was invited along with our other friends. I have a new girlfriend (23f) that I have been dating for a few months (she is absolutely amazing, drop dead gorgeous, kind hearted, thoughtful, etc. I never thought I could feel this way about someone). I invited her too, and she knew my ex would be there but was okay with it.At the pre-game, my ex had a couple shots, was maybe tipsy. She came up to me and my girlfriend and started talking to us normally. I was kind of confused as to why, but just went with it. She then says to my girlfriend, ""Hey did you know me and Ilovepotatoes22 used to date back in the day?"" to which she says, ""Yes, I'm aware"". Ex gf smirks very subtly and under her breath says, ""Yup and he sure downgraded"" while looking me dead in the eye. My gf said ""Wow, I'm not interested dealing with this, excuse me"" and excused herself to go talk to some of my other friends. I was angry, I truly don't believe I ""downgraded"" as my current gf is the most beautiful girl in the world to me, and in my eyes I do find her more attractive than my ex. I told my ex ""I'm not sure what you're on right now, but gf is definitely an upgrade in every aspect possible so do not get that twisted. Let's just do what we should have done 5 years ago and never speak another word to each other again"". She went to the bathroom crying and my friends over the past few days have been telling me that she told them I called her uglier than my current gf. I told my friends what actually happened and they understand but they told me I could have been a little bit less harsh. Ex gf is apparently really depressed and has been telling my friends that she doesn't want to come to any of the hang outs anymore. Am I the asshole?"
488,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for eloping when the wedding is this weekend?,21301,e5yzda,2667,"My girlfriend and I had planned to get married on Saturday. We wrapped up all our planning around Halloween, all that was left was to ring some time this week and make sure everything was running smoothly.She called the venue and the person she spoke to asked her to confirm some changes she'd apparently made. My girlfriend had no clue what he was talking about, and he reminded her of all the changes that had been put in recently. We had not approved any of these changes. We were able to get some of it put back the way it was but there are some things that we couldn't change back at such short notice.The venue forwarded us the emails asking for the changes so we could look over them. Our communication was being done via an email account we created solely for wedding stuff, and the email address which asked for the changes is the exact same address, except 2 letters are switched round. The venue is very apologetic for not calling us directly but can only fix so much of it at this stage.We think we know what happened. The whole time we were planning the wedding we got pushback from both sets of parents, and the stuff they had the biggest issues with have all been changed. I'm willing to bet that all of this was related to at least one of our respective parents. We don't know anyone who would want to fuck with us or the wedding this badly except our parents, who got pissy when we told them they couldn't financially contribute to the wedding because they were trying to trade their money for whatever wedding stuff they wanted.Right now the stuff that we wanted that is still in this wedding is my suit, the venue and the DJ. My girlfriend has gone to pick up her dress and she's not heard from the shop so we're assuming that hasn't changed. I'm calling round everyone and it looks like the menu has been changed, as has the guest list and the cake. We paid for the wedding we'd planned and it looks like any additional costs from the changes (such as the extra people) were paid for by someone else, but they wouldn't give me any of the card info for legal reasons.We probably won't be speaking to our parents again after this, unless one of them owns up in which case we'll just stop speaking to that one, but this feels like a joint effort as it's dealt with both sets of parent's complaints.Before my girlfriend left to get the dress she gave me permission to post this as we are seriously considering eloping. We have the marriage certificate here, the honeymoon is unaltered and exactly what we wanted, and there's a few appointments we could make between now and Saturday at the town hall to get the certificate legally signed/filed.However, we now have around 200 people attending this wedding in 3 days (our original guest list was about 100 including families and plus ones). People have booked hotels, planes, trains, and are coming from other countries to be here. None of these people have done anything to us and would be getting caught in the crossfire if we were to elope instead.Would we be the arseholes?Update: I posted in the group chat I have with all 4 parents that someone has been screwing with the wedding, we've found the email they used and we'd be tracking the IP address to a device and location (this was all absolute bullshit, we don't even know how to find an IP address). As soon as I said we'd be tracking the email they all started pointing fingers and accusing each other. It looks like all 4 of them were in on it together. Still not sure what we're doing about the wedding but all 4 parents are uninvited.We're thinking that we might elope for the ceremony and then have the reception as planned (it's all the same party/venue and we won't get money back) because of the number of people who are coming from all over the place.UPDATE 2: My mother made up the email and her mother helped re-plan the wedding. We knew they'd been meeting for lunch but we didn't realise what they were doing in that time. Caterer and baker can fix the menu and cake, and the clothing is all safe. Venue think they might be able to fix the decorations and the parents have paid for the changes.The ceremony itself is the same (we were worried it had been changed from a non religious ceremony to a religious one but it hadn't) so we'll probably just go through with the day as it currently stands, with a couple changes.We've decided that we will meet up before the ceremony with some close friends (no parents) to sign the certificate so we're not doing it surrounded by strangers, then have the ceremony and rings as planned with everyone invited, go to the reception with everyone who has been invited because innocent people have paid out money to be here, and then afterwards we will go for drinks with the people who were at the signing earlier in the day.The venue offered us security, but we're not going to uninvite the additional people or turn them away, and as for our parents, we're not sure. The options are either invite them and let them deal with their invitees so we don't have to, then cut them out of speeches and just don't acknowledge them all day and after the reception cut contact, or just don't let them come, in which case we will need the security the venue offered because I can't see them just not going.Venue have also said to pretty much just leave it with them, they'll put what they can back to what we'd planned and they're prepared to offer a partial refund based on what they can't fix (so if they fix 50% of it, they're prepared to refund 25% for the 50% they can't fix)**FINAL UPDATE:****We had a small private thing where we signed the certificate with our closest friends, then we went to the planned ceremony and had a short service where we exchanged rings, followed by a reception.****We told the parents that they were not invited, told the venue they weren't invited, the venue put what was essentially a bouncer at the door, and they still got in. They don't seem to understand what they did wrong as they boasted to their guests that ""they planned this, but we changed it to what you're currently seeing"" and their own guests ended up being the ones to tell them how fucked up that was. They were pretty much shamed by their guests into leaving about an hour after they arrived. Also, half their guests didn't show, it was probably about 60-70% our guests in the end, and we definitely had the majority. Food (including cake) was sorted out but not decor, and venue are refunding us 50%, which was going to be 30%, but then they let the parents in.****We only spoke to them once to tell them that because after completely fucking up our wedding plans they then couldn't honour one simple request to not come, they would not be hearing from us, potentially ever again, and if they contacted us that would change to definitely never hearing from us again.****We are currently in the cab on our way to get drinks with the same friends who were at the signing earlier and then off on our honeymoon.**"
489,Not the A-hole,AITA For walking in then immediately walking out of the restaurant when I saw my husband's family present for my our wedding anniversary?,21277,jak0cu,1648,"Pardon my English, it's not my first language.This happened last week, and I'm getting scolded for what I did by everyone I told about what happened.Last week was mine 26F and my dear husband's 29M wedding anniversary, his mommy started calling asking about ""our plans"" for this year's anniversary  (we been married for 3 years btw).My husband told her that we were gonna go out and celebrate and have dinner together, she asked if she could host the anniversary at her house instead and invite family members, It was an instant no from me, my husband seemed to be wanting it but I already made other plans.She had us celebrate with her while we were together on a vacation for two weeks, that was horrific and the worst experience so far.I knew my husband was still talking to her about it but I just let them, two days before the anniversary he asked if we could have a family celebration but still go to the restuarant and have good time, I felt uncomfortable all I wanted was for some time together, alone, plus I had other plans after dinner and to have the family come is not logical at this point.I was working that day til 3pm, he didn't go to work, but was busy all morning and didn't want to say with what, so I figured he's getting me a present or something.He picked me up at 3pm, I remember his mom constantly calling while we were in the car, I got home, took a shower made sure he checked with the restaurant about reservation for the night and we left at 7pm.Again, his mom was talking to him on the phone in the car I asked him why she was calling all day and he changed the subject.We arrived at the restuarant, he walked before me, I followed him and after I walked through the door and saw his mom, dad, sister and cousin and her kids, I froze for a second, my heart dropped I felt so much rage as he tried to get me to keep walking, His family saw me when I turned around and walked out and back to the car, he followed me and started saying sorry but I should just go inside with him since it was already done. I yelled at him literally just losing it and telling him that he ruined the night I was waiting for and how he turned it into a family dinner to which I said no from the beginning, he begged me to go inside but I refused, we argued til his mom came trying to convince me to go in.I went home in a taxi after I told them to go back and celebrate.He came home not liking that I left and refused to talk about it, His mom texted me about my behavior and how I ruined it for her son and the whole family, And that i should respect her family and stop whinning and overreacting like that.Edit to answer some questions: We're in Europe/this is our third anniversary, the past anniversary was celebrated with his family/this isn't the first time I experienced the same thing on other occasions, mother in law gets more aggressive on christmas and thinks she keeps stomping boundaries and dear husband has no problem with that."
490,Not the A-hole,AITA for ordering jalapeños on my pizza intentionally to stop my wife eating it?,21264,c2ib5a,1142,"First up, I love my wife very very very much but damn does she drive crazy sometimes. I’m a big dude, I’m 6’4 and I’m always goddamned hungry. I’m a firefighter so I’m always on my feet and simply put, I just love foooooood. My wife always eats stuff like salads and nuts but she will ALWAYS help herself to some of my food which pisses me off because it’s just the right amount of food that I want to eat but she’ll go ahead and take some. I’ve asked her so many times to leave my food alone and she’ll get really defensive and say ‘it’s just a little babe, you’ll be fine!’ Except I’m not fine, I’m hungry. And then when I’m hungry I get hangry and I snap at everyone cuz I’m goddamned hungry!Things came to ahead at our kids 3rd birthday party. Wife said no to cake, despite me bringing over a sliceto her, so I gave that slice to my cousins kid who was on his second slice. my girl ended up eating the whole slice whilst I held the goddamn plate and then when I went to get myself some all the cake had finished.Lately my MIL gave me the idea to just spice my food to stop my wife from taking mine, since she can’t stand spicy food.  I tried that yesterday, I ordered pizza and asked my wife if she wanted one. She said no. I went ahead and got pepperoni and jalapeños, and predictably when it came she came over and got all mad because it was spicy and she couldn’t eat it.I told her I had to take drastic measures because I’m fed up of sharing my food and she called me a selfish asshole. Who’s TA here?"
491,Not the A-hole,AITA for helping my daughter’s boyfriend against his parents wishes?,21256,ke0xs3,1557,"EDIT UPDATE: WOW!! First, thank you all so much for the love and confidence-boosting responses!! Seriously way more than I expected!!Second, things have seriously changed. My daughter and her bf are living in their new place (address unknown to his parents), his salary is being directly deposited into his own account in a different bank than his parents use, he has a new phone with a new number that they don’t know, and all three of us (him, my daughter and me) have restraining orders against both of his parents. Long story short, am I the asshole for giving my daughter’s boyfriend his portion of the money he needed for them to move into an apartment together, against his parents wishes?His parents are majorly pissed because I gave him the money, because they didn’t want him to move in with my daughter. He is 22 years old, works a full time job, and has been dating my daughter for 3 years.  His parents require him to give them his entire salary every pay period, it’s direct deposited into their bank account. They give him an “allowance” of $100 per week. They told him he could not move out because they need his help financially, but his father makes really good money as an architect, and his mother makes a moderate income as a high school teacher. I personally don’t think they should be depending on their son’s income or forcing him/guilting him into giving them his money. I gave him the money, he opened his own bank account and had his job change his direct deposit. They are moving in the apartment this coming weekend. His mother posted a scathing post on Facebook basically threatening me with bodily harm for “messing with her family and getting involved with things that are none of my business.”She then proceeded to call me and scream at me with pretty much the same message. I hung up on her. So, am I the asshole for getting involved in their family matters? Should I have stayed out of it?"
492,Not the A-hole,AITA - Mad at my wife for throwing away pendant from previous marriage,21255,bm4cr7,4242,"I’m really upset with my wife after what she’s done, but everyone of our friends/family thinks she is right to do what  she did. So I’m posting here to get an unbiased perspective.I’ve been married to my current wife for three years. We dated for 2 years before getting married. Before meeting my current wife I had been married to my “high school sweetheart” for well over a decade.My late wife passed away very young from breast cancer. It was an extremely traumatic experience for me, and I didn’t start dating again for several years after the fact. I never had any real relationships before her (parents were both physically abusive, siblings absent) so it was especially hard on me.I’ve always had a momento from my previous marriage. It was a greenstone/pounamu toki pendant. She gave it to me for our first wedding anniversary. Before meeting my current wife I would wear it almost 24/7, going through several strings.When I met my current wife she wasn’t comfortable with me wearing it since it was from my late wife. So I started wearing it less often but made it clear to her it’s an extremely important item to me. For a time she accepted that until recently.Over the past few months whenever we had a minor disagreement, she’d bring up my pendant and then turn it into a shouting match demanding I get rid of it. I can understand why she might feel uncomfortable with me having it, but I had stopped wearing it at this point, it stays in my draw 24/7... Why can’t she accept it’s very important to me?Long story short, when I was at work last week she grabbed the pendant and threw it in a nearby river. When I found out I broke down because it was literally the last thing I had to remember my late wife. I don’t know. Maybe I am not respecting her feelings and holding on to the past. AITA?Edit: when I say ex-wife I mean late wife. We never divorced."
493,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my British neighbors they should learn chinese because we live in china?,21251,d5xhpn,2102,I saw s similar post which inspire me this. I’m Albanian and I live in Guangzhou China. I live in an apartment building that’s filled wit mostly Chinese people and one British couple. They’ve been here 3 years longer than I have and can’t say anything other than NIHAO and XIEXIE. They constantly knock on my door or call me to translate chinese stuff to which I told them to stop and start learning chinese. I taught myself to be half fluent in Chinese before I got my work assignment and learnt the rest in the 6 months I’ve been here. They managed to get by because some of the staff spoke basic English but they left. I told them that they’ve been here for several years and should be at least conversational in chinese. Yeag chinese is hard butvits inconsiderate and rude to not put any effort into learning chinese. I told them im never translating for them again and they lost their shit saying I’m an asshole and I’m making their lives difficult. I told them I’ll start speaking to them in chinese and Albanian from now on
494,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my ex he was very inconsiderate of our daughters when he found out the gender of his new child with his wife?,21241,lzb22o,1438,"My ex and I separated about 4 years ago now. We have a 7 year old and a 5 year old girls. He has a son from a previous marriage that he has full custody of, he is 10. He’s been remarried for 3 years now. I recently got married and welcomed a son last year. Well I dropped the girls off to their dad for a gender reveal party. Ex and his wife are expecting. Well I was watching the live video on Facebook and it was a boy. He said “thank god, thank god” then he said “I didn’t want anymore girls. I would have shot myself” my girls were standing there and that looked at the camera and I could see it in their eyes that his words had hurt them. I went to pick my girls up and I told him he should watch his words around the girls because when he said that it really hurt their feelings. He told me it was none of my business and I was trying to ruin his happiness. To which I responded that I was not trying to do that but protect our daughters for never feeling adequate when it comes to their brothers and he was showing blatant favoritism. He got mad and spewed some nasty names at me. I took the girls home and they told me that their daddy only loves boys and he doesn’t like girls. I calmed them down. AITA for bringing it up to him on their special day?"
495,Not the A-hole,AITA for making a dinner my husband does not love?,21237,invlaa,2103,"My husband does not like soups or stews, so I rarely make them. I love them and we haven’t had one in months. Today I wanted to make something quick, with what I had in hand. I was craving soup. I made a ground beef, rice and vegetable soup. My teenagers loved it and ate 2 bowls apiece. My husband, on the other hand, was upset and pouting about it. He would not even try it at first, saying he wasn’t hungry. Then he took a few bites and left it on the table. He thinks I am inconsiderate for making something he doesn’t like. I think that it is rude to complain about a meal someone else makes for you. I do the bulk of the cooking and often make things I know he will love, even though I am not crazy about them, like shrimp. AITA for making something I love once in a while?"
496,Not the A-hole,AITA for surrendering my sister's child to protective services when she forced me to babysit due to mental health?,21218,dfp1yq,4626,"I'm 26M, my sister is 28F. We're the only family we both have, neither of our parents are with us anymore and we have no aunts, uncles, or cousins. I'm single, so is my sister: she's a single mother of a 3 year old. Despite all of this, we're not particularly close. We live in the same city but I might see her once a year in passing.To make a long and convoluted post short, last week she came to my house and offloaded her son to me. She said she had to go to the hospital for mental health and I was the only person who could help. I couldn't even protest, she didn't even come inside. She took him in the car seat, put him on my porch, rang the bell, and told me all of this as she's walking back to her car. She left no diapers, no supplies, no nothing, not even a word of when she'll be back.It took me less than four hours to contact police and have child services involved. He was basically abandoned with me, or at least that was my thoughts. They took the child away and my sister is still in the hospital. I have no way of contacting her, nor has she tried to contact me. I can't imagine the hellstorm that's going to be unleashed when she's out.I'm just not equipped to handle a kid. My home isn't child proof, I have no friends who could babysit for a stranger, even as a favor. I work full time, I'm in school. I couldn't think of any alternative besides getting child services involved. I feel like I let my sister down but first and foremost I believe she let her own child down. I don't know what's going to happen.Was I the asshole?**edit**: just so there's more info, I wasn't even left the base the car seat latches into. Never mind I don't even have a car. I'll admit I could have asked a friend for help picking up children stuff but that doesn't address anything else.Child services is what its name implies, here where I live it's called FACS. They work with families in struggling times like this. I told them my sister's name, the hospital she's at, and they presumably are working with her to sort this out. They left contact information but they won't disclose any status to me because I'm not the parent. Even just the status of my sister, they weren't at liberty to say.I didn't ""put the kid up for adoption"" it doesn't work like that. I contacted this agency who is trained to help in situations like this, where living arrangements are difficult or impossible for a child. My best guess is they have him in a foster home for now until my sister's out. I don't know anything else beyond my best guess.And I can't just take time off work or school to care for a child 24/7 when agencies like the one I contacted can offload the work for me. It's been 8 days and no word on anything: if I took eight days off work with no telling when I could return, I might as well not return."
497,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to allow my husband to apologize to our daughter for “ruining her life”.,21222,isc6hn,2120,"My daughter, 19, is going through a tough time. On top of the obvious difficulties of the pandemic, she has been struggling with depression. Her classes are all online so she lives with us.My husband and I are both working from home so we are very involved with her day to day. We do our best to engage her family walks, game night, cooking together, but she is still feeling pretty down. She sees a therapist online but I am not privy to how that is going.In the last couple days she has been displaying a lot of resentment over her childhood. I’m specifically talking about ages 12 to 14. During those years, her father, my husband, was diagnosed with prostate cancer and was going through aggressive chemo.He has recovered enough to live a normal life. I won’t lie, those were very tough years for our family. My daughter is an only child and was used to our full attention and engagement. It was a hard transition for her to have her father not be able to care for her like he used to and myself having to split my time between her and my husband.We had a lot of support from our family and we were able to maintain her lifestyle with their help. She didn’t have to quit any teams, she never missed school. I do acknowledge that emotionally there was damage so we did family therapy for a years.Yesterday she was in a bad mood. During dinner I asked her what was going on and she went into this explosive rant about how many issues she developed due to us. Apparently we are responsible for her grades slipping, her relationships failing, her weight gain, etc.She tied it all back to her missing crucial development during the years where her father had cancer.At one point she says something like “Has it ever occurred to you that maybe you should apologize? You basically deprived me of a childhood”My husband says “I’m sorry honey, I could have done better, and I could have done more for you.”I shut that down and told her “No, you are not going to guilt your father into apologizing for having cancer. This is unacceptable. You need to accept that life is not fair and there is very little we can do about it. Go to your room and calm yourself down”She told me to go fuck myself and went to her room.My husband and I have been arguing about how this was handled. He thinks that an apology is not big deal, and he was hurt by what she said but that “he could take it”. I think that she is looking for someone to blame for her current unhappiness and that we, as her parents, are easy targets. I also know that my husband already feels a great deal of guilt for putting our family through so much turmoil.I love my daughter and want her to be happy. At the same time, I do believe she is at an age where she needs to take on personal accountability.Am I the asshole here?TLDR: Daughter tried to guilt husband into apologizing for having cancer.EDIT: I am shocked by the amount of comments and cannot read them all. Thanks to everyone who commented and double thanks to those that awarded the post.I do want to say that, while the concern for my daughters mental health is encouraging, there is a rather harsh dismissal of my husbands mental health here. As a society I think men are expected too much to just suck it up and take it on the chin.My husband struggles still with his heath, the possibility of cancer returning, and his own depression. I value my daughters mental health, dont get me wrong, but I dont value it above my husbands. I thought what she said was extremely damaging to him and I reacted to that.I do regret the harshness but not the message. "
498,Not the A-hole,AITA for banning my parents from my wedding if they don’t attend a tea ceremony?,21209,gou7bj,1853,"I’m (29f) going to get married this September (if a certain unnamed virus let us). For important context, I am white but my fiancée (31m) is Chinese-American. I’m going to admit that I’m one of those girls who has been planning her dream wedding since I was a girl. My husband doesn’t care as much and told me that I could plan the entire thing to my heart’s content with one caveat - there’s an important Chinese tea ceremony wherein the bride and groom make tea for both sets of parents and then the parents give them gifts. It’s incredibly important to him and the only thing he wants on our wedding day (Okay, he also consulted on the food and he wants to marry me lol).He’s been planning that which will happen shortly before the wedding and will be a smaller ceremony with only family and very close friends. Today, while zooming with my parents, my parents said they found the whole ritual absurd and stupid and that she was going to skip it. Well, considering they’re an integral part of it, that doesn’t work for me. They couldn’t even explain why they thought the ritual was stupid, just that it was. I basically told them that if they skipped the tea ceremony, they should skip the wedding as well.That led to a lot of crying and arguments and now my parents aren’t talking to me and my sisters have sent me texts about how irrational I’m being, how I’m being cruel, and how I’m being a bridezilla. But...this is important to my future husband so it’s important to me. It’s the only thing he really insisted upon for this wedding. But they are my parents and I want them to beat my wedding. AITA?"
499,Not the A-hole,AITA For Making A Gay Sex Joke?,21209,iq3c6s,2091,"Heya people! I think this is the right sub for this, so let’s get started on the story and y’all can judge me.My (M22) friends and I were at a friend’s house - Jacques (M23), and we were drinking, and chilling. (In a responsible manner!). I’m gay, been out for over a year now!While we’re drinking, Jacques makes a comment, and I turn it into a sex joke, because why not? The atmosphere had been pretty light hearted, everyone was fucking around, all was okay. Everyone freezes. Jacques asks me “What the fuck do you mean by that?”, so I explain, and he looks visibly uncomfortable, and tells me that I’m not funny, and that gay men shouldn’t make these sort of jokes around straight people, because it was essentially me hitting on him, and like two other of my friends agree. The atmosphere doesn’t go quite back to normal, and Jacques moves further from me after calling me an “unbelievable asshole”, and so I make an excuse and bounce.Razor, my best friend, who’s gay and has been out for longer than I have, thinks they’re overtly sensitive, and he followed me immediately when I left, and said some choice words about Jacques and the two friends who defended him. I don’t know how to feel. When I was younger, I had issues with boundaries, so maybe I did transgress some, and Jacques told me that unless I apologise for making him uncomfortable, I’m not welcome in. So what do y’all think? AITA for making a gay sex joke around a group of mostly straight people?EDIT: He said “Bottoms up!” and I stood up.EDIT 2: Over 3’000 (!) people now know I’m a bottom. Thank you Reddit. EDIT 3: To clarify something I wasn’t the first person who made a sex joke. Others were made."
500,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my fiancee there's no take-backs?,21208,f0jzt9,410,"Here's the thing: I 27M proposed to my 26F fiancee(yay!). The proposal time was a surprise but the actual proposal was not, she knew it was coming for a while but this is where it starts to get a little weird. I got her advice and opinions on the *PERFECT* ring for her. We both make decent money but I wanted it to be special so I saved up about $9000 of my spending money over the years(we live together) so I can afford to have the perfect ring for her. She was pointing out this ring and that ring and these rings how perfect they were, what her ring size was, what kind of cut she wanted, what setting, what band, etc...Anyways I landed on the perfect ring for her, she approved of it, and we were all set just waiting for it to be fitted properly. The ring came in about 3 weeks before the proposal and I made it special and she said yes, excitedly. I'm talking dinner, wine, roses, backrubs, movie in bed, THE WHOLE SHEBANG. There was not a detail I missed, I can assure you I went full perfect boyfriend(fiance now) lmaoCue to now, which is now 5 weeks after the proposal, and suddenly the whole style of cut and setting that she wanted for her ring is awful. Apparently she made a HUGE mistake with what she wanted and now suddenly she doesn't like it. I asked her ""Maybe just wait a few weeks and see if your mind changes? You never know, maybe this is just proposal jitters or something"" and no she's adamantly against it. I told her in no uncertain terms that this ring cost me a lot of money and we did research for months(almost a full year) together and I thought her mind was made up. I can't return the ring so now I'm kind of fucked and she's crying and telling me to leave her alone all night tonight. I personally think she's being childish but I called my mom and she tells me that I should have gotten her something she wanted. I told her that I DID get her something she wanted but now she doesn't want it, now my mom is telling me to just sell it for a loss and get one she does want. I said fuck all that, not trying to be mean but I'm not going to return a ring that cost me almost 5 figures just because she changed her mind TWO MONTHS after I bought it and had proposed. I think she's talking to her friends now but idk what to think anymore. Am I being an asshole by not returning it? I could *technically* afford it but this will put a huge dent in my savings and our overall account in general not to mention how stressful all this has been for me.edit: no longer engaged, she cheated on meedit2: I'm done guys, sorry for the shitty edit"
501,Not the A-hole,AITA For kicking my son out of my house after he cancelled my job interview?,21201,krxs5l,1498,"Please hear me out first. I'm a single mom (45) of a 20 year old son (Chris) Chris is in college. He studies engineering. Being a single mom at a young age was not easy for me. Despite everything I been through. Despite my own family giving up on me. I made sure my son got the life he deserves. He was/is my everything. I worked several jobs that were different from eachothers. I was able to own a home after years of renting. And more importantly I was able to provide Chris with an opportunity for education.Recently. Chris moved back in with me because he no longer could pay rent. His next semester is starting soon. And he's been talking to me about the possibility of selling my house and buying a house in the city where he studies so he will no longer pay rent and said that it was better to move. I declined for several reasons 1 grew up here, my old friends live here. 2 the city is expensive 3 this home means a lot it represents my hard work and sacrifices.Chris didn't like that. He threw a fit and kept brining it up trying to convince me to do it.Last week he kept pressuring me. I told him that I found a potential job at a company and it was an opportunity because I been looking for 3 months. He took as in I don't want to move because of my new job. But it's not true.Yesterday. I found out that he contacted the company and cancelled my interview and then deleted my email. I use a computer and it's in the office so he gets access to it. He told me he wanted to check his college website for some reason and I thought nothing of it.That was the night before. I found out yesterday morning that someone cancelled my interview. I confronted Chris about it. First he denied then he said that the company wasn't what I deserved anyway and I can find a better position when we move to the city.I was so mad at him for ruining this for me and pressuring me to move leaving me no choice. I felt as if he was trying to sell the house from under me after he said he found a potential buyer and just wanted to make things go smoothly and all I have to say is yes.I yelled at him and argued with him telling him that he was an adult and should manage his own issues. Told him to get a job but not expect me to turn my life upside down for him. He yelled back saying I was selfish and I ended up kicking him out of the house. His aunt knew and was yelling at me for what I did saying I was treating him poorly and he was hurt by me.Just to clarify his aunt is my sister. She doesn't have children of her own. And Chris considers her as a second mother to him. She's always defending him nomatter the reason. He hasn't left town yet and she wants me to call him.In need to mention that this is not how he is normally I have no idea what's going on but he was constantly talking about it and was insisting so much it got me upset and worried honestly."
502,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling the police because the family I tutor for keep leaving me with the kid?,21183,ljdzd6,1655,"I am an after school tutor. Homework help and co-curricular support mostly, test prep sometimes. I am pretty adamant and clear that you cannot leave the house while I’m working with your child because I am not childcare and I cannot be made responsible if something like a medical episode happens. I also don’t want there to be the appearance of impropriety. I don’t need them in the room or anything, just in the house.Even still, parents occasionally try and use me as an excuse to run a child free errand or run to the office or whatever else they do. Usually after the first warning it stops, and there’s also a financial penalty. Recently I had a family where the mom evidently left during our session. This was the first time that it had happened. Eventually I needed to leave for my next appointment. I texted and called her, but no response. I was not comfortable leaving the child (8) alone without an adult present. After 15 minutes of waiting and becoming late for the next child, I got nervous and called the police non-emergency line to ask what I should do next. They said they’d send someone over. The police arrived and said they’d wait with her. Of course, I have many angry calls and a negative review from this mother now, saying I’ve created a huge problem for her and the police think she’s some kind of bad mother now and a social services agent asked her all kinds of questions and how dare, etc. She claims she didn’t realize the session was only thirty minutes and thought it would be ok to quickly leave around the corner because I would still be there when she returned. I was comfortable with the decision at first, but she seemed genuinely shaken up by her interactions with the social agent or officer she spoke to (unclear which from her message). And a friend of mine says this was an uncalled for escalation that could have actually placed the child in more jeopardy than my leaving after the appointment (or that I should have waited for the mom to return and spoken with her first as a warning.) AITA?"
503,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling my new foster parents about the money that my late foster mom gave me even though she needs surgery and cant afford it?,21156,kh1brg,1746,"I'm 15m and I have been in foster care since I was born. From what I'm told, my mom was real young and her parents made her give me up for ""adoption"" which realistically turned into me bouncing around foster homes my entire life. My mom wrote me a letter that I'm surprised was even given to me, explaining everything. She basically said that I was the most beautiful thing she ever laid eyes on and that she is sorry that she couldnt keep me, as her parents wouldnt allow it and that she hopes I search for her some day. Which I plan to. Her parents can go fuck themselves though because they'll never be family after putting me through this.In 15yrs I have been in 3 orphanages and 19 foster homes. Most families give me up after receiving their first state paycheck, but few have held onto me for a few months. My last foster mom was perfect. She loved me. Like, actually loved me. Not the fake bs that normal families spew. She did everything she could possibly do to bring out the real me and she truly, truly cared. Unfortunately my beloved foster mom passed away 3 months ago from terminal cancer that I wasn't aware she had. She included me in her will, where I recieved $50k in a trust fund that I cant touch until I'm 18 and $8k of just ""play cash"" that I can use now.My new foster parents arent that great. I was dropped off on their doorstep the day after my foster mom died without so much as an introduction. They showed me around the house and then just left me to my own devices and that is how it's been since I've been here. They dont speak to me. They basically ignore my existence. Now I'm not sure if my case worker told them about the money I had been given because lately my foster mom has been dropping little comments like ""I really need this surgery, how can I afford it?"" She isnt speaking directly to me but it seems like it occurs every single time I walk in the room. So I'm assuming my case worker blabbed. Mind you, she literally does not have conversations with me so I dont even know what the surgery is for and admittedly I dont care. The reason I feel like an AH is because I have this money and could help her out with the surgery where she is technically helping me out by putting a roof over my head. But at the same time, I know this home will be short lived as well and in a few years I will be 18 and forget these people exist, much like they do with me now. AND I know they already get $750 a month just to have me here. AITA?"
504,Not the A-hole,AITA for ruining my childs gender reveal?,21145,kv26lr,3441,"Myself (27M) and my wife (27F) are having a boy, we already have a girl who is now 2. My wife is really into films, oscar type films and she is like an analyser when watching them so she wanted to make a gender reveal short film, 10 minutes long to say we're having a girl, kind of weird but I went along with it, we posted it and she was super happy with it but it cost so much, she hired expensive cameras, we drove out to scenic areas for the right shot, I'm working full time during this process, exhausting.So we just found out that we're having a boy and she started writing a script, I thought there's no fucking way I'm doing that again so I posted on facebook ""we're having a boy"", she's pissed at me telling me to delete it but the damage is done, I don't feel bad, I saved us at least £4k.What I don't get it why she's just making films about gender reveals, she can write a script about anything and not be on a strict \~6-7 month time limit."
505,Not the A-hole,AITA for not splitting my inheritance with my estranged sister?,21140,grhu7a,1425,"So, this is obviously a long story spanning our entire lives but I will try to condense it as best I can. Players are: Me (30f), my sis (34f), husband (39m), Neice (5f), and dad (80m)My older sister has had trouble with drugs, alcohol, and the law our entire life. She has been bakeracted no less than 20 times since her 18th birthday and has actually technically died twice due to her decisions(she's back by the grace of the medical professionals treating her). My dad has constantly bailed her out on anything whether it be jail or missing rent payments because she spent the money on drugs.My dad had cancer for the last decade. Despite my sister and him already living in the same apartment complex and my dad paying the entirety of her rent, my husband and I were essentially forced to move across our city 3 months before our wedding because Dad was starting chemo and needed extra help. My next 3 years were devoted to caring for dad. I lost 2 jobs due to the time I needed to take off to care for him and my sister continued to mooch and do absolutely nothing for him. I was the one expected to make medical decisions for him alone because he didn't trust my sister not to try to off him for his money.Dad is now finally at peace and against my better judgment, I asked my sister to come by so she could say her goodbyes. Before they even came to take him from his apartment to the funeral home, she was demanding that I open and read the will. She insisted that Dad had been paying for her to try to finally earn her Bachelors and she needed 2k. This amount changed to 3k within 24 hours. She started pointing at Dads belongings and said that she was ""claiming items she wanted"". After I finally read the will (I'm the executor of the estate), we learned that Dad left everything to me except for creating a trust fund for my niece that my sister cant touch until her 21st. My sister lost her mind and started demanding that I split what I got from him. Dad also left specific instructions to me and my husband to use what he had left us to buy a house, pay off our debts, and finally start a family and we really want to honor his last wishes, but we wouldn't be able to if I split it with my sister.Obviously, emotions are high and none of us are thinking right. But AITA for respecting Dads wishes and making sure that we use what he left us for what he wanted it to be used for?"
506,Not the A-hole,AITA for not defending my cousin after he stole my baby name?,21134,f8uwin,1981,"I’m currently 31 weeks pregnant with my first child- a little girl!  I’ve known for years what I want to name my child.  The first name has sentimental meaning for me, and my husband and I chose the second name together.  We’ve planned the name for years- when we were dating and talking about the future, one of the things we always said was that our firstborn would have this name.  It’s gender neutral, so it didn’t matter if it was a girl or a boy.  As soon as we found out I was pregnant, we started referring to the baby by name.  Because we’ve had this name in mind for so many years, our whole family knows the name and the meaning behind it.  We’ve already started decorating the nursery with little items that have the name or initials on them. There’s basically been no question that this would be our child’s name.My cousin’s wife gave birth two weeks ago.  They had refused to tell anyone what name(s) they were thinking about during the pregnancy, which is fine.  But the name that they ended up choosing is pretty much exactly the same as the name my husband and I chose for our baby.  It’s exactly the same first name and then an almost identical second name.  It would be like if our baby’s name was Mary Elizabeth, then the name they chose is Mary Eliza. The actual name isn’t as traditional/common as that, so it really does stand out as being the same name.I was pretty upset when I found out, because they definitely knew the name we’d chosen and it feels weird and kind of spiteful to use it.  I know we don’t own the name or anything, so we can’t stop them from using it, but it still felt pretty icky.  My husband and I basically decided to just be sort of privately weirded out but to try our best to ignore it.  I sent my cousin a text to tell him and his wife congrats on the baby, and then didn’t reach out any further than that. I didn’t say anything to him about the name.Well, it turns out that even though my husband and I are trying to take the high road here, the rest of the family is pretty mad.  Apparently, a bunch of them (including my cousin’s mom) have reached out and told my cousin and his wife that what they did is really shitty and that they need to think about changing their baby’s name. They’ve also reached out to me to say that they think it’s awful and that they know how much meaning the name has for me.  I absolutely didn’t ask them to do this, but I can’t pretend I’m not happy that people are “taking our side.”My cousin called me yesterday and said that I need to call all of our family and tell them to stop pressuring him about the name and that I’m fine with it, because they’re ruining his and his wife’s time with their newborn.  I have no intention of doing so because A) I didn’t ask them to talk to him about it in the first place and B) I’m not fine with it I think it’s weird that he and his wife did this and I have no interest in defending him. AITA?"
507,Not the A-hole,AITA for removing my birth control without consulting my husband first,21097,cr5dka,4775,"Sounds bad, but going to preface this by saying I’m not tryna get pregnant without my husbands consent I went to the doctor yesterday because I’ve been super emotional and my body has been out of whack and my doctor was basically like “We gotta get this implant out of you” (I had nexplanon, the implant in your arm) and I decided to give my body a break from hormones and to use condoms/ other methods for the time being because I don’t want to conceive.I call my husband and tell him and he’s like “Oh ok did you get on the pill?” And I said no, I didn’t want to be on hormones anymore and he flipped out and said I need to be on birth control because it’s the best way to not get pregnant but like, there are things he can do to not get me pregnant but now his whole family and him are convinced I’m like trying to get pregnant without his consent. Should I have called and discussed this with him since it effects him too (as in he has to wear a condom)ETA: if I hadn’t of taken it out yesterday, I would have to wait a month because that was my gynos my next available appointment. So it wasn’t that I didn’t want to consult my husband, it was kind of a quick decision.ETA #2: I have a fucked up cervix so I can’t have an IUD, can’t use tampons, lots of stuff.ETA #3: I believe now he is the asshole it’s not normal for a husband to react this way, and he kinda sucks anyway. Thank you for the support and the judgement (even the dude who messages me I was basically just a sex doll)"
508,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting a nurse fired over a shirt?,21086,kl0f22,1913,"I am a general surgeon and I very rarely get involved with nursing issues, I have also never made a formal complaint or really any complaint about a nurse before. We had a 7 year old admitted in for abdominal pain about a week ago, I got called down to the ER to consult when I got to the patient I notice there is no parent or guardian with the child and no one watching him. I asked the nurse assigned to his case where the parents is because I need to talk to them and have them sign consent forms since the child needs surgery. The nurse said the parent was in the parking lot and would call. I am thinking the parent is giving updates not unreasonable. The mother arrives and I explain the procedure, the documents are signed we are good to go. As I was leaving to go and schedule the OR I hear the nurse telling the mother ""okay you need to leave now."" I hard stop, even with COVID restrictions we were not restricting parents from the rooms. I inquired why she is not allowed, thinking there might be a reasonable explanation. The nurse said ""she is dress inappropriately and needs to leave."" I look the mother up and down, she was dressed in pajamas pants a shirt that had text that said f**k b****h make money (not censored). ""If she dresses like that she can't be here"" the nurse exclaimed. I informed her she needs to find another case to be assigned to and the mother is absolutely allowed. The complaint I made to her supervisor got her fired. I feel like I did the right but the nurses have been giving me some mean looks and seem to be distant and cold towards me which is new to me. Am I actually the asshole in this and shouldn't of complained to her supervisor?"
509,Not the A-hole,AITA for lying to my dying husband & destroying his parents life?,21078,e4pfqz,3015,"Posting from a throwaway account. Me (31 F) & kids (2 F, 4 M) moved with my husband  (31 M) from where we met, married & had our children in California to Texas. We always said we would raise our kids in small town Texas where my husband grew up. It was his dream & I was happy to support him!When we moved – to a house a few blocks away from his parents – we thought we would be getting some help from his parents with the kids. They babysat the oldest twice in 8 months. They showed very little interest in the kids but had my husband over multiple times a week doing things for them (they are in their 60s & in good health) & did come over to dinner a few times. He adored his parents & they adored him. Their only child. Their golden boy. My husband was diagnosed with a rare cancer that was terminal earlier in the year. He died within 5 weeks of diagnosis. It was tragic & I am still in shock. When he was dying he was in a great deal of pain & on morphine & wasn’t always coherent or thinking straight. However he told me his parents were devastated I would move the kids back to where I grew up in Canada & they wouldn’t be able to watch the kids grow up. Well…that was my exact plan. My parents are the most amazing grandparents & help my sister out a lot (2 days a week of full babysitting!) & would do the same for me. Canada has a great education & healthcare system & my siblings & parents are live near each other so the kids and I would have a support network.I lied to my husband. I told him I would stay & raise the kids as Texans as we had planned. He was in so much pain & distress & I couldn’t add to it. I chose the easy way out.2 weeks after the funeral I moved my sweet babies home to Canada. My parents in law are now telling everyone I betrayed a dying man’s last wish. I have told them we will visit every year & they are welcome to visit us in Canada whenever they wish. They don’t care – they said I have broken their family.AITA for lying to my dying husband & breaking up his family?"
510,Not the A-hole,AITA For kicking my son and his wife out after they took my daughter's room?,21027,kz8l27,1615,"I'm a single mom of two (Dale22,and Kim15) my late husband passed away when Kim was 10. It was too much because It's hard being a single mom. Everyone in my life has never stood by me. Where I'm from society tends to be harsh on single moms.I always felt much stress with all the responsibilities and everyone expecting me to give up. There were MANY times when I felt like a failure and I never want  to be seen as a failure in my children's eyes. I want them to look up to me. Learn from my experiences. And learn to stand by themselves and be strong. Kim is the apple of my eye. She went through so much. I tend to be ""overprotective"" of her as they say. I was with someone (A Police Officer) who was ""nice"" to me but once I noticed how poorly he treated Kim. I told him to leave immediately. I decided to focus on Kim.Dale and his wife are expecting. He's been unemployed for months, and they left their rental apartment and moved in with us temporarily. However his wife started disrespecting Kim's privacy. Walking into her room constantly taking her things and ruining them. They brought boxes of baby stuff and stored them in Kim's room. I told her to move the boxes to the storage room but Dale made excuses that the stuff might get damaged. Dale and his wife talked about staying for a few more months (she's 8m pregnant) til after the baby is a few months old. His wife suggested that my daughter move into my room and they take her room and turn it into a nursery. I said no it's not up for discussion. Dale understood but his wife didn't like it.Kim came to me saying Dale's wife is trying to convince her to give her room to her ""nephew"" I told Dale's wife firmly to stop annoying Kim.Yesterday I came home and found Dale moving Kim's stuff out of her room replacing it with their baby's stuff. Kim was in the livingroom waiting for me. She was crying I was livid. Dale's wife made her a sandwich to ""calm her down"".I saw Kim's room. her bed was moved. Her fav. Posters. Her closet and graphic art some were put there by her dad. I confronted them. Dale said it was his wife's idea and told him she'll ""work it out with me later""I got into an argument with her. I lashed out at her after she said Kim can take the storage room. I told them to leave immediately. They argued for an hour then left. My mom and sister called me in the evening. Asking how I could kick my own son out and told me to let them move back in. I refused and now they're calling me bad mom saying I'm playing favorites.Dale's wife talked about putting the nursery together and taking pictures of it to share on an FB page for everyone to see. That's what Dale told me which made me feel upset to be honest."
511,Not the A-hole,AITA for not going to wedding after agreeing to be best man?,21023,ha2zwm,1387,"Last year my best childhood friend (28M) asked me (28M) to be best man at his wedding, and I happily agreed. I think the process brought us closer together as we talked weekly for the next few months planning logistics and the bachelor party.I worked hard on the bachelor party, which was a far away vacation. I spent months planning, and lots of money. I found time in everyone's schedule and booked an amazing vacation, it was a blast! I was his only childhood friend at the bachelor party, and everyone else was from his college frat. It was therefore like a typical college party setting, I did my best to learn all the drinking games they already knew how to play, and I thought we had a great time. I guess I was out of my element, however, because my friend later told me that he felt like he bonded with his other friends better that weekend, and how he wants one of them to be the bestman instead.So I calmly told him that's fine, and that I won't be coming to the wedding because I feel like my efforts as a pre-bestman were underappreciated, and I feel uncomfortable traveling to spend a days with people who make me feel that way. He got upset, and his fiance told me I should ""grow up"" and be a good friend I told them that we're all grownups, and we have no obligation to each other just because we're childhood friends. Friend and his fiance called me an asshole, so AITA?TLDR: I agreed to be friend's bestman, then he changed his mind over a year later after I fulfilled pre-wedding bestman duties, and I decided not to go to the wedding."

We then had four more children. My husband's brother and his wife have been trying for long while, and when they approached me to be a surrogate, I agreed to give it a try. The first try miscarried, and I agreed to try a second time. Unfortunately, that next try ended in a stillbirth. They are already badgering me for a third try. I'm not doing this again.I've now carried and birthed 6 babies. I've been pregnant too many times. I am mentally and physically DONE. My tubes have already been removed after child #4+5, and when I can, I'll be getting a hysterectomy. My doctor says I could have more pregnancies, but that I'm now high risk for bladder issues and uterine lapse in the future. I'm ready to pack it in now. I'm done being a brood mare.My husband is now worried about my health and supports me, but he's never been good at standing up to his family. My sister in law is calling me crying daily, and I don't know how long I can be nice, especially with now implied legal threats.

513,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling my sibs I sold our childhood home when I didn't, just to get them out?",21006,k6krsq,1223,"Ok so I'm the youngest of five and this mess only revolves around me (f29), my just older sis (f31) and our older bro (m36). Two older sisters aren't part of this thankfully.Ok so I currently live with my gf at what was my grandma's home. But I bought said home from mom a bit back for cheap (the house wasn't pristine and i've sunk a few thousand into it already and it's looking better). Well my mom lived in our childhood home with 31 y/o sis and bro for the last... forever. (two oldest sisters live in diff states) YS and Bro never moved out for longer than a year each before moving back. Both are absolute slobs who refuse to clean up after themselves. And they made our mom clean up after them. She couldn't stand mess and would clean just so she wouldn't have to live in filth. Eventually she (in her 60s) couldn't stand to live there anymore so I asked her to come live with me.They essentially drove our mother out of her own home because they were slobs.Well she lived with me happily (my house is clean and she didn't have to work and just enjoyed her time in the garden) but she passed away not too long ago. I've barely been coping because out of all of my siblings I was closest with our mom. Our personalities just meshed well. Whereas my siblings didn't. She loved them (she wouldn't have cared for them for so long if she didn't) but they stressed her out unbelievably.Well I found out our mom left her house to me only. She left each of my sibs some money but the house and everything of hers in it is now mine. My sibs who live in that house didn't like it and pitched a fit. Said I 'manipulated mom at her weakest' into getting the house when they should have gotten it. I told them to go to hell and the only reason it probably got left to me is because mom knew I'd at least remember to pay the property tax each year so the house wouldn't get taken. Neither of them pay any bills (save for their phone bills...) so she probs doubted they'd keep the house long if she gave it to them.Well they expected me to follow in mom's footsteps and pay all the bills there for them. I laughed and told them that going forward they'd be paying rent and all utilities if they wanted to stay there and they'd need to keep the place clean or they were OUT. They flipped their shit and screamed that it was their childhood HOME and I couldn't do this! I said the deed is in my name so I very much CAN.I sent them a letter that basically said they can either pay rent or they'd be out. They refused so I sent them another letter saying they had 30 days to vacate the premises because I'd sold the house. They went apeshit but they didn't have a leg to stand on so they bailed. I've since cleaned up the place (it looked like a drug den and cost a lot to deep clean and fix stuff) and am renting it out to a nice Asian couple who have lots of exotic fish.Told some friends I lied about selling the house and they said it was an asshole move. AITA?**Edit:** To the people commenting 'why lie?' 'lying was pointless' or 'you were fine until you lied' need to understand that I know my siblings well. And I know for a fact that a regular eviction wouldn't have worked since they'd know the house was still mine, so they'd have not left and just squatted indefinitely. But once they thought the house wasn't mine they bailed (because they probs were worried the new homeowner would shoot them for trespassing). So lying was necessary imo.**Edit II:** I see a LOT of confusion about the house situation so to clear things up- I bought the house that originally belonged to my GRANDMA from my mom. The house said Grandma left to my mom. I live in that one with my gf. But my mom left me HER HOUSE that she bought herself when she was a young mom. That's the house I rent to the couple with the fish. There are TWO houses in this story. The one I live in (grandma's old home) and the one mom gave me (the one the couple with the fish are renting). I hope this clears things up! "
514,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting our teacher suspended for using red and green pens in class only?,20992,et09ar,1761,"Edit #1 - oh boy.. so many replies! Might have to wait until morning to get through them all.. but i'll read some now! Thank you xoEdit 2.... wow. Thank you so much for all the replies and silvers! I never expected to gather such a response. I am reading through as many replies as possible but i think there might be a few too many!I just want to take this opportunity to educate people a bit more about colourblindness, and how you can help if your day to day lives!I saw one comment that asked how i could drive if i can't distinguish between red and green (due to traffic lights). It made me laugh whether it was troll or genuine but please check out :' a super helpful and informative website about living with CB, the causes of it among other helpful tips.To help visualise colourblindness check out: (Doesn't work great on mobile fyi).And those who are asking, i have heard of enchroma glasses! Maybe one day i will experience all the colours (after some saving). ________________________________________________I'm a 19F currently attending university.One of my main professor's insists on using the whiteboard in class, for explaining everything and anything. Whether it's words or diagrams or explanations, so it's pretty important to be able to read.Here's the problem: i'm colourblind and i cannot distinguish the difference between red and green ... like at all. It just looks the same to me.This is a common problem so i ALWAYS carry a black and blue white board marker pen with me to give to a teacher in case there isn't a blue one around. It saves time and embarrassment on my behalf.So i tell my professor my problem and the first lecture goes fine, he doesn't use green, and uses my blue and black pens instead (idk why but this room only had green and red). The next lecture however, i give over my pen and he starts to use the green and red pens to explain graphs and stuff. Completely un-understandable to me. So i raise my hand in a room of like.. 120 people.. and ask him if he can use the blue pen i gave him so i can actually see the difference in lines.The professor then kinda... scoffed? And said he couldn't change now or the rest of the class would get confused. I just nodded and looked away because his tone was so condescending. The rest of lecture he used green and red so i just couldn't write up my notes.(Insert- a super amazing girl in front of me asked for my email and sent me her notes that she was creating on her computer. She even changed all the colouring so i could see it properly and i was so shocked when i got them i nearly cried (people dont do this often lol)).Anyway i email the professor and ask him one last time if he could just use a blue pen instead of red or green and he emailed back almost instantly to tell me that a lot of work is done in green and red and ill probably struggle with it anyway! I got so mad i emailed up the head of our school and told them everything i said here. The next day rumour was going around he was suspended and i got a confirmation of it later that day when the head of school contacted me for a meeting in a few days.I feel pretty bad. I don't want this guys career to suffer just because of some pens haha. The stress is getting to me. AITA reddit?"
515,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving roommates’ 4 year old home alone with a friend for hours because I don’t want to normalize babysitting?,20992,ist74r,1923,"Edit: because some are confused on why I think I’m an ass/posted this, the main issue from Rose’s side is that I left a *male* babysitter who is a stranger to her and there’s this thing against babysitters being males (maybe I’m not some cultures). I thought it was more obvious from the post alone but I’m just clarifying hereI’ve been living with my roommate, “Rose” since the beginning of the quarantine. We didn’t chose to be each other’s roommates, everything was by landlordWe aren’t exactly close since we’re just roommates. I tend to stay in my room and every now and then we talk, but it’s mostly just “hi”, “hello”, good morning etc. Recently Rose had an issue and she needed to bring her daughter in (4 years old). I’m sure what happened entirely, I just know that it’s an emergency. The girl has been here for 3 months. At the beginning we had a long talk about boundaries, agreements etc because of the sudden addition. I told her that under no circumstance would I be a babysitter even if I get a stay at home week/day. I don’t want to suddenly become the constant babysitter. Rose cannot work at home but I sometimes am able to. She agreed and explained that she is perfectly okay with this so long as I’m okay with her inviting either babysitters or family to watch the baby. I agreed so long as they didn’t get a copy of the key (like maybe 1 family member/babysitter but not ALL of them)Where I might be the asshole:Rose apparently couldn’t find a babysitter or something because when I woke up the baby was in MY BED sleeping and she left a note/text explaining that her babysitter couldn’t come. I was absolutely pissed. I tried texting and calling but she didn’t answer and I had to work in person. I called up a friend for a favor, and they babysitted while I worked. I told them of any allgeries etc.When I got home Rose was PISSED that I left the baby with a stranger. She said that while my friend was nice, that I had no right to leave the baby with someone she personally didn’t know and that I never know what could happen. She says that she understands I had work but that I’m being ridiculous to not never offer babysitting AT ALL especially if I’m home for a week on a week off.Where I think I’m not the asshole:I was cranky and told her to fuck off because I had work and could’ve left the baby alone and that I told her to never rely on me for babysitting etc.  I trust my friend since he’s been working in daycare.She’s angry and says I don’t know how I endangered the baby and that she will call the police the next time. I told her that I will call the police the next time she leaves the baby alone."

One day when we were all at work/school, one roommate and her bf entered my room and had sex for whatever reason. My app alerted me and started recording automatically. When I got home I confronted her about it and she owned up to it, said they did it in a different room to ""spice things up"" and said that it’s ""not that big of a deal"". She was however pretty angry at the fact that I had a security camera in my room and a video of her having sex (which I deleted obviously). She said that recording her having sex is a bigger invasion of privacy than her having sex in my room.AMTA in that situation?"
517,Not the A-hole,AITA for threatening to sue my sister because her kids broke my iPad?,20951,egwqp2,5756,"This happened a couple of days before Christmas. My sister, her 3 kids (4,6,8), and I were all staying at my parents house for the holidays. I have a 1TB iPad Pro (the largest screen model) that I use for my job. I do digital commissions, design band posters, design flyers to make money on the side as I’m in college. I saved up for a year to buy this iPad, it was an investment in my hobby. I left the iPad plugged up in my fathers study where I was working on some projects the night before. I got up in the morning to find the thing *shattered* in the living room. My sister nonchalantly apologized and said “oh sorry the kids broke your screen. Dad says he has a new one he’ll give you to replace it.”  She didn’t even bother to wake me up when she saw that they were broke it. I asked her why she wasn’t watching her fucking kids, and how they got my iPad from my fathers study. She said that she *gave it to them* so they could watch YouTube. I obviously started yelling at her, and asked her how she could be to obtuse as to let her kids play with my stuff without asking. She called me selfish. “They’re my niece and nephews and I should want to share with them.” Wtf.My dad tried to give me a iPad Air, and tell me that it was the same thing. I told him it was unacceptable and I wanted my iPad replaced *immediately*. He said he didn’t have the money, so I went to my sister and demanded the money. She tried to ask if she could make payments as the cost would wipe out her savings, and I said no way. I wanted the full cost of the iPad, the pencil , AND the $250 that I’m going to miss out on because I couldn’t finish the project I was working on It would be around $2200 dollars. She tried to call me heartless, and told me to think of my niece and nephew. I told her to go fuck herself, if she was a better mother she’d have more than 2k saved up when she has three kids. My parents think I’m over reacting, but I don’t. She is trying to avoid me and not speak to me, and I told her that I would be suing her then for the full cost of my iPad and lost wages.She’s acting like a total bitch, and crying on social media about how her heartless brother is trying to sue her and break her and her children over an “honest mistake”. I’ve gotten calls from several family members calling me a bad brother, and asking me to reconsider. I can’t believe this is happening. WIBTA for suing my “poor broke sister” because she can’t watch her fucking kids?TLDR my sisters kids broke my expensive iPad and I’m suing her, AITA?"
518,Not the A-hole,AITA For Telling My GF She Doesn't Understand Real Life?,20906,dg5qgn,3512,"I'm M23 my gf is F21 and we've been together for about 2 years now. Now I come from a very middle class family, dads a blue collar worker and mom has been working since I was a kid as well. My GF's family is filthy rich and even she'll admit she's spoiled, everything paid for and a 3k a month allowance. Because of this she's never had a job, doesn't care about school really (She's doing fine though but in a easy program), or about having to make money in the future. My car broke down recently and I've been taking the bus/subway to work and she's been razzing me about it saying its sketchy taking public transport etc. I told her I'm saving up again for a honda, and will get it next month. She just tells me to ask my parents for the money or dip into my savings. I told her she has no idea how most people live real life so she shouldn't be giving out financial advice because her dad funds her whole life. She got very pissed at me and said that she's not dumb and so on and basically called me a huge asshole. Her friends also contacted me and told me to apologize to her, and oh her friends are the exact same way. Spoiled rich white girls who go to Western (my ontario mans will get this one). I told them to kick rocks. AITA?"
519,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting my neighbors car towed for blocking me in my garage and now they want me to pay for their tow fee and ticket for calling to get them towed,20892,l83k0s,1033,"I recently bought a house that was vacant for a while and people were using it as parking.I moved in now it’s clear someone lives there so people stopped parking there.Sometime last week I had to leave but couldn’t because when I opened my garage door there was a car there blocking it in.I don’t know who’s car it is and I’m not going to waste my fucking time walking around knocking on doors to figure out who’s it is.Also you could’ve parked in the grass or off to the side or something I don’t know Now I found out it’s someone 3 doors down because they knocked on my door demanding I pay them back because I’m the one who called to get it towed. I told they should’ve had their visitors park at their house and they said “no, because we’ve always parked here” Okay well not anymore and I’m not paying for your shit. I kind of feel bad how much they had to pay but I shouldn’t have to take time out of my day to go figure out who’s car it is because they’re being dicks. Also why park in front of the garage??? Literally anywhere else would’ve just been annoying but I could’ve gone on with my day"
520,Not the A-hole,AITA for not allowing my grandmother around my baby because of something she lied about when I was 15?,20894,kltri1,927,"I'm currently 28, female. I am married with 3 kids (4yo twin boys, 3 month old girl). My grandmother is 71f. Back when I was 15 my mom had a set of twins (bou and girl). She was put on bed rest because the C-Section she had went wrong and she lost alot of blood. Where she needed help and I went to school full time, she invited my grandmother in to our home (free of cost) to help her out. At some point or another my mom had threatened to kick her out because every morning my mom would check on the twins to find my brother ""missing"". My gram (who is extremely overweight) had been taking my brother from his crib and was sleeping with him on her chest on the couch. My mom told her multiple times to stop and she refused so my mom threatened to kick her out. My grandmothers way of retaliating was to tell my mother (who had extreme Postpartum Depression) that my sister (2 months old at the time) rolled off the bed and fell onto the tile floors (this never happened). This obviously caused extreme panic on my moms end, which made her spiral because she was already suffering from the postpartum. Because of this, I dont want my grandmother anywhere near my baby. I lived out of state when my twins were born so she didnt see them until they were 2 years old and she was never allowed around them alone. However, now that I live in the states and have a baby, she has been harping on me to let her meet my daughter. I kept telling her no, but gave no reason up until last night. Where I reminded her that where I witnessed her causing my mom unnecessary panic, I would not be allowing her near my child because I'm not going to chance her doing the same thing with me. My grandmother lost it and really tried saying that that scenario never happened and that we made it all up to make her look bad. A lot of the family has also sided with her (she told everyone) and says that I need to ""let shit go"" and ""stop living in the past"". I have been told that I am alienating my grandmother and that I am going to destroy her by not letting her build a bond with my child. AITA?"
521,Not the A-hole,AITA for charging rent from my dad but not from my mom?,20879,fx7ox4,1497,"My father and his family lost their home and had no place to live. He has a teenage son, my half brother, who is 15 and a known smoker. Because they had nowhere else to go, I offered them to stay at our other house we usually rent out to other people. The house is situated within our property, just next to our home. Prior to my dad moving in, my mother and my sister moved in with us 6 months ago after my stepdad passed away. We have many spare bedrooms in our home so them moving in wasn't a problem. . This is where the conflict arises :I don't charge rent from my mom. I don't let her cook. I cook for 5 people in our home (my husband, my mom, my toddler and my sister). It's just my way of looking out for my mom because that's what she did for me when I was young and struggling. She raised me as a single mother for years.. My dad has a problem with this because I am charging him and his wife the same rent I charge other tenants (it's a well furnished house). He thinks I'm playing favourites between parents because I don't charge my mom any money. He thinks he should pay less rent as compared to other tenants because I'm his daughter. Apparently, he doesn't like to be reminded of the fact that he charged me rent the one time when I was very sick and had to move in with him and his wife when I was in college. I had a part time job, and struggled to pay my bills with my illness. I wasn't shown any consideration. He also has a problem because my husband doesn't help him out with his groceries. He is older now, 71 and thinks we should be the one getting him his groceries. We don't think so, his wife is 50 and he has a young son. They can be the ones doing the grocery shopping if he's to fragile to move around. AITA?"
522,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to change out of my bikini to save my niece's feelings?,20864,ho4td0,1653,"My husband assures me that i'm not TA, and I agreed at the time but now I feel a bit guilty because I don't want to upset anyone, a child least of all.Since i've been home more for quarantine I Marie-Kondo'd my closet, which means getting rid of all of my old bathing suits (they all lost elasticity or were worn out) except for one - this is relevant later.This past weekend we had a small family gathering at our house because its hot and we have a pool (and quarantine limitations had been lifted in our area a while ago so we finally decided to get together for the first time in 3 months). My husbands parents, his brother and wife (SIL), and their 2 kids, niece 9f and nephew 6m came over. So we're all in the backyard BBQing and getting ready to swim. I change into my swimwear and come outside and start applying sunscreen. SIL rushes over to me and pulls me aside and asks that I cover up or change into something less revealing like a 1-piece as niece has been sensitive lately and dealing with some body image issues regarding feeling fat (she's not). I tell her that regrettably this is the only swimsuit I have anymore due to cleaning out my closet and I plan on swimming as it was sweltering hot, but after my sunscreen dries i'd be happy to throw something on over my swimsuit until i'm actually in the water. She then asked me if I could just go inside then at least until the sunscreen soaks in and come out covered up. I was like uh no? I'm not going to hide in my home for 30+ mins while we have company over that we haven't seen in 3 months. SIL says it will hurt niece to see me in a 2-piece because of my ""unrealistic body image"". I tell her there's nothing unrealistic about me because i'm a real person so I don't even know what that means, and i'm sure niece will be fine for only 30 mins. I also said that while I sympathize with body image issues as i've dealt with them in the past myself, it's probably not helping to just shelter her from seeing people's bodies and maybe work on body positivity instead. She says I don't understand because I don't have kids. So I sit in the shade to apply sunscreen and let it soak in and she takes niece inside for over half an hour before coming back out. I don't know if i'm in the wrong here, maybe I could have just gone inside for a while to spare my niece's feelings but at the same time I feel like I shouldn't have to hide my body - and at my own house for that matter. And it was just a 2-piece, it wasn't like really booby or revealing - the top was high-cut kinda like a sports bra and the bottoms were normal bikini cut, they weren't like a thong bottom or anything. I didn't notice that niece was upset but SIL definitely was, maybe niece was just hiding her feelings? I don't want to add to her body image issues and feel kinda bad now reflecting on it in case I made her feel bad. AITA?Edit: wow I was not expecting this kind of response. Thanks for your judgment everyone, i'm replying where I can. There's a lot of people dragging SIL in the comments, but I will note that she's generally a good person even though she may have come off badly in my post, I personally don't think it's her fault and suspect social media or peer pressure is the cause of niece feeling bad about her body, but that's just my personal speculation."
523,Not the A-hole,AITA for embarrassing a girl trying to steal from me,20860,g214cd,1031,"I made this account because I'm tired of the passive aggressive bull this girl keeps throwing at me, so I want to see if I'm the ass or her. Firstly,  I'm a guy,  26, who tries to have the healthiest life style I can.  I also make a good amount of money and can buy the natural lotions and skin care/bath care products I can get. These aren't cheap and when I do get them I make sure I use them smartly and make them last. My roommate and I get along great, she doesn't touch my things in the bathroom and I don't touch hers. She has her own shelf,  I have mine.  She does have a friend who comes over sometimes who is a self proclaimed beauty guru who does reviews on line to her 500 followers. But doesn't have a job and 'borrows' products from her friends. A few months ago she came over, and I had just gone to my room to get dressed,  products left on the tub bench, and I hear her in the bathroom practically squealing ""girl you got the good stuff! Let me use it, my followers will love it!""I hear my roommate say no that it's not hers and the friend just says quietly that she'll use it when I go to work. After I get out of my room to head to work I immediately get my products put them in my room and listen to her start to do her show in our living room,  stating what products she's about to get to which I say loudly. ""No you're not, I bought them, if you want them then get a job and buy them."" I then locked them in my room and since then she's told me how she lost followers, got mocked for trying to steal and was sobbing in her live stream. AITA or is she upset she got caught?"
524,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my husband to grow a pair,20853,g77rzf,3588,"My husband and I have been together for 16 years, married for 11. He has always had a pretty low pain tolerance though he won’t admit it (once he accidentally kneeled on one of our toddler’s hot wheels cars and it put him out of commission for the entire day although nothing was broken or even bruised). I’ve become alarmed many times at his over reactive response to things like stubbing his toe or hitting his funny bone on something, he will literally moan and whine and shout out in pain over the most minor stuff. I always thought of it as a quirk of his, not too major to actually have a conversation about, until yesterday. I have what my doctors believe is Crohn’s disease, and I’ve been in the thick of a nasty flare-up for the last few days. For those of you unfamiliar, it’s an inflammatory bowel disease and causes diarrhea, vomiting, etc. I was trying to take a nap for some relief and had just gotten to sleep, when I hear an actual scream from downstairs. I jump out of bed and find my husband clutching his hand. I asked what happened and he told me he pinched his finger in the baby gate. I looked at it and it wasn’t even red, no broken skin. I told him he woke me up with his scream and probably also woke up our son, and he said he couldn’t help it, it just hurt so bad. I said ‘you know what else hurts? Shitting my brains out all morning and not being able to take a nap because you’re being so loud over a minor mishap’. He got really offended and said that I wouldn’t like it if I pinched my finger either and I said no I sure wouldn’t but I also wouldn’t scream my head off, I didn’t even do that when I was giving birth to a 9-lb baby unmedicated. He said well your body was made to do that, I’m not made to get my finger stuck in a baby gate. This is when I rolled my eyes, told him to grow a pair, and went back upstairs to try and rest.Yes, I said it out of anger, but my husband is acting like I emasculated him horribly and insulted him to his very core and is barely speaking to me. I’m not in any hurry to apologize especially since he didn’t for waking me up when I’m dealing (pretty silently) with objectively more pain than he was.ETA: I can pretty definitively say that he doesn’t have an underlying medical condition. He has to get medical checkups for work regularly. I honestly agree with most of the comments stating he just wants attention the overreactions ramp up when I’m having a flare or when we’re at a big family gathering or something."
525,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my brother to stop complaining about child support since he chose to have sex with a woman he barely knew?,20853,cy4t2r,4314,"My brother (26/M) has a one year old son with a woman he was never in a relationship with, apparently they were friends with benefits. Long story short she got pregnant, he wanted her to abort and she refused, she had the baby, he got a DNA test confirming he’s the dad, now he pays child support. They share custody. I had dinner with him the other day and as usually he bitched about how child support is unfair, etc. I told him for the first time that it’s his fault. He chose to have sex knowing the risk of pregnancy. He got mad and said it’s not fair because women can abort but men can’t, I told him he knew that before he has sex with her but he still risked it. He called me an asshole, but I was just being honest.Edit it:I just woke up and I’m surprised at all the hate messages I’ve gotten from other guys. I AM A MAN. So many of the hate messages assume I must be a woman because I believe in sexual responsibility. Wtf is wrong with men today... this shit is weird."
526,Not the A-hole,AITA for purposefully making my meal-prep super spicy to stop my BF from eating it?,20850,g36usa,1977,"Okay so my boyfriend atm stays home and I work three 12s a week. That said, I like to meal prep so I don’t have to cook every day for my lunches. Well, my boyfriend, WHO STAYS HOME ALL DAY, thinks it’s a good idea to eat my lunches while i’m at work. I’ve asked him to stop but he says, “But your food is so good. Plus why don’t you make more so I can have some?” I’ve told him multiple times that I’m stressed and that I can’t make more meals because it’s a lot of work. So he continued to eat my food. I remember that he HATES spicy food while I really enjoy it. So what do I do? Add spice. A lot of it. Last time he ate something of mine, he called me yelling at me. He said I was being an asshole and that I know he hates spicy food. I told him, “Tough. Stop eating my food then.”Now he’s mad at me....Tldr- After asking my boyfriend NOT to eat my meal prepped food, I purposely made my latest meal preps SUPER spicy and now my boyfriend says I’m an asshole. AITA?UPDATE: Holy smokes, I didn’t expect for this to blow up... as for some questions, doubling my recipes would take more time. I use a lot of veggies and rice when I cook and I homemake my sauces and which takes a lot of time. For those of you who say I need to dump him, it’s a big consideration, but it’s hard. He may not be the most considerate person and I’ve brushed it aside since I’ve been very lonely for a while. When we first started, he used to cook a lot for me and that was great. But after we moved in together, he changed and expected me to cook/shop/clean more often. Worst of all, dating for me is extremely difficult. I work in transportation, and while I have a schedule now, I used to have to work nights so dating was hard. A lot of dates were upset with  me and my job because of lack of availability. This guy seemed independent enough that me being gone for two to three days wasn’t a problem. For reference he’s early thirties and I’m late twenties. Honestly, I’m overwhelmed with what to do. We have a lease together and while I can fully support myself, he can’t since he’s laid off and I’d feel terrible to kick him to the curb. So for now, I’m logging out... thanks everyone.UPDATE TWO: Okaaaaay so after a long conversation with my now ex-boyfriend... we decided to end it. I told him that eating my food wasn’t okay and that because he’s home all day since he was laid off, he still needs to carry his weight with the housework, shopping, and cooking like he used to when we first met. What happened? He had a Brett Kavanaugh style break down. Just started crying and saying it wasn’t fair because he’s stressed and shouldn’t have to worry about, and I quote, “Stupid things like cooking and cleaning.”  So I told him my perspective that I’m tired, I’m dealing with people all day, and I just want my lunch untouched or replaced when I meal prep. I mentioned that it was never a problem in the past and don’t understand why it’s an issue now. He just started yelling at me saying I was starting a stupid argument and that it’s not an issue. He doesn’t have the money to get takeout like he used or buy food. He said that because he was laid off, he needs me to buy all of the groceries, pay his half of the rent and utilities, and cook for him. We then got into other issues of our relationship and things that have been building for a while. These are things I’d rather not get into, but nonetheless, I told him I’m tired and honestly would be happier without him. He stopped crying, got all red faced, and started screaming at me. I told him to get his stuff, go to his parent’s house, and not come back.  When he tried to fight it, I told him that I won’t hesitate to call the cops since the neighbors probably heard him screaming at me. This Monday, he and I are going to the leasing office to get him off the lease. I’m in the process of boxing up his stuff for him to move out. I’d rather do it myself and have him take his boxed stuff than have him here and do it. The less time I have to see him, the less chance I’ll change my mind. Honestly, I cried a lot last night. But after a while, I realized it was nice to be alone in my own bed. I could actually spread out and enjoy it. Thank you to everyone who have been supportive. I’ve been unhappy in this relationship for a while and just didn’t know if breaking up was the best course of action. Thanks for saying that I deserve more and letting me see past rose tinted glasses."

All my family are hardcore Christians. So they weren't happy with us having a baby before getting married. My fiancee and I decided to have the wedding before our baby arrives. Thankfully everyone in the family supported this decision and wanted to help. We're getting married on march. However the problem started when My fiancee was showing the women in my family pictures of her wedding dress. Mom and my aunt got mad at her for picking a dress that's 'revealing' and said that it'd show guests her pregnancy and they didn't want that. Said that they won't accept that and demanded she return/replace it With another wedding gown to cover up. My fiancee was crying saying that my mom was pressuring her and coming up with other-wedding dress suggestions that aren't her style.I told my mom she was overstepping hugely. And that it's funny she thinks of her grandbaby as something to hide and be ashamed of. My mom got into an argument with me. lashed out and said I should NOT be putting them in this awful position. I told herShe was uninvited since she refused to stop. She got my aunt(ie) involved. I simply replied to her shaming text by telling her she too got uninvited to the wedding. I kid you not my sister kept berating me and Claiming my fiancee is being the problem and a bride-zilla. I told her she too was uninvited and I let it be known that everyone will be uninvited too if they try to get involved. That's when shit hit the fan. Now dad and the others are furious saying ""Jayyyysus Adam you messed up big time"" And Went to Call me  un-effin-reasonable.saying I need to re-invite my mom , aunt , sister asap and get my fiancee to return her 'offensive' dress because that's the least I could do for them. In fact They said I should be on my knees begging them to show up after I made them look bad for getting My fiancee pregnant before getting married.I haven't talked to them yet. They made my Fiancee feel bad about every choice we made. Including uninviting the family.My little sister likes my fiancee's dress. At least there's a supportive member in my family. My brother and his wife just keep parroting my mom's hurtful words and calling me a doormat for doing this."
528,Not the A-hole,AITA for contacting my aunt's EX when she wouldn't pay me for the damages their son did?,20824,ib7t37,1286,"My(16) aunt and her husband just got divorced, I don't know the full details but my father mentioned that he cheated, actually, non of my business. They have a son(9) who is currently living with my aunt.My parents invited my aunt and cousin over to our place  for a short stay because they have been under stress. I was supposed to play with my cousin as the adults have their conversations but we have nothing much in common, so I let him play on my laptop instead.He was playing some web games as I surfed on my phone nearby and he suddenly lost it. He slammed on the keyboards hard and swiped the laptop off the desk. When I picked it up the screen was broken, it was pixilated all over with a white crack across the middle. I yelled at him a little before my parents stopped me, telling me to be nice as he is just upset because of recent events. My aunt just kept telling him ""It's all right. "" and din't even look at me.I had the screen and keyboard fixed. The warranty covered the keyboard but not the screen, so it cost around $400. My parents gave me $100 to cover part of it but the rest was ""my fault"", which I didn't agree, I never asked to babysit an angry kid nor ask him to destroy my laptop. They made it sure that they were not going to give me more, so I asked my aunt instead, and got a scolding from them for being insensitive.Insensitive or not, $300 isn't a small sum for me and since I figured nobody would pay me, I decided to contact my aunt's EX husband instead. After all, my cousin is his son too, so it's worth a try.In short, he did pay me the full bill, in which I returned the $100 back to my parents, but they were all fuming when they found out about it. It was like a great humiliation to my aunt, unhealthy for my cousin or something like that. Maybe its bad but I don't really have much empathy for them, so AITA?"
529,Not the A-hole,AITA for interrupting my roomates having sex in the kitchen while our mutual dinner is being made?,20821,gxbjm2,1173,"Throwaway account btw. Two nights ago I walked into the kitchen to ask my roomates what they wanted to do for dinner. We started making some pasta, so I went to my bedroom (located directly next to the kitchen) to play some games while waiting for the pasta to cook. I hear the timer set on alexa go off, and my roomate moan ""Alexa stop."" I interrupt them by walking out there and announcing myself by asking ""Is dinner ready?"" So they have to quickly stop and pretend nothing was happening. I decide to stick around because dinner is practically done now. Female roomate goes to the bathroom, and I bring it up to male roomate while we're in the kitchen. I let him know I think it's inconsiderate for a couple reasons, and I really don't want to see that. While eating dinner, I send a similar message over snapchat to female roomate, who has been angry at me for two days now. Male roomate already had a more extensive conversation with me about it, and we agree about not having sex in a ""public"" place in the house. Am I the asshole?"
530,Not the A-hole,AITA for serving myself the biggest piece of meat?,20822,bzr0h7,3239,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2 1/2 years. We live together as of recently (4 monthsish) and we get along pretty well. We have a lot of separate hobbies, and one of mine is hiking. I wouldn't call myself a ""peak bagger"" but I do like to add mountain summits to my hikes when I can. BF doesn't enjoy hiking more than occasionally so he rarely comes along. For reference, I am a 5'3"" 150lb woman. He is a 5'7 170lb guy. On Sunday I went for a long, strenuous hike with my friends. If you're familiar, it's 13er James Peak in CO. It was a 9 mile, 3,000ft elevation gain hike (from where we started). I had a fun time and went home and did my usual workout (short run, weights, some light yoga) after. Suffice to say, I was pretty hungry by dinner time. I made dinner, which was grilled chicken with lots of grilled veg, some pasta salad as a side. When it came time to eat, because of my big day, I grabbed the bigger piece of chicken. We're talking a 5oz piece versus a 7oz piece. BF got upset about this when he saw my plate versus hit place, and he made a pretty big deal out of it. He told me that there's no reason for me to serve myself such a big piece of meat, he's the guy and he should have it. I told him that I'd hiked and done my workout that day, and that he puttered around the house and went for a short (5 mile) run. He told me that growing up, he was always taught that the man got the biggest piece of meat because men need more to sustain themselves in general. I said that I agreed, but again, I'd climbed a mountain that day and burned much more than he did. He told me I should accept the good calorie deficit, or load up on the pasta salad and veggies instead. We've been arguing about this for days and he tagged some friends in and asked his parents (who said to keep them out of it, lol). So far people are split, some believe even if he didn't do much that day it's just weird for a woman to actively try to eat more than her boyfriend. I think that's stupid and outdated and comes from a time when men tended to do more physical labor in general. AITA? Is this just really dumb?"

My daughter(8f) was adopted from India 5 years ago. Her right leg is completely malformed. We were told that we are going to need to amputate part of it so she can have a proper prosthetic. When she came home we used a custom prosthetic that worked with her leg but it was clear that wouldn’t last forever. My late wife and I said we wanted to wait until she was fully settled into the family before getting the surgery. 2 years later my wife passed away(for reasons I don’t want to share) and that really put everything on hold, it was a very hard adjustment. But finally after I felt like we were getting back to normal last year I got the surgery scheduled for April 22 2020. Let’s just say that couldn’t happen because it was “non-emergency” which annoys me because yeah she wouldn’t die if she didn’t have the surgery right then but it was necessary. I also started dating my GF 8 months ago, she has 3 kids who get along with my kids and even though she’s only met my kids 3 times she’s pretty nice to them.Well 5 months ago I finally got the surgery scheduled for Feb 10 2021. Last week my GF started feeling sick(we got negative tests) but she was ok until 2 days ago. That morning she called me and said she was feeling really sick and she needed me to come over. That was the day of my daughters surgery. I said I couldn’t come over and she got really annoyed. She kept throwing it in my face that the doctors called it a non-emergency surgery. She suggested I just drop my 8YO off at the hospital and then come over. I of course said no. Then she suggested I come over while she’s in surgery, the surgery only takes about an hour and I wanted to be there in case anything happened so I again said no. The surgery went well and my daughters currently home and resting but my GF has been ignoring me. She said to a mutual friend that I’m not even trying to make compromises here. I don’t think I should have to compromise when my kids in surgery. AITA here? Should I have tried more to be there for my GF?Edit: I texted her saying we need to breakup and she hasn't seen it yet.Edit 2: She has Fibular Hemimelia in one leg, I don't know why people think this is Polio."
532,Not the A-hole,AITA for blowing up at my boyfriend 'just because he was ignorant'? (His words),20789,kvw14w,2476,"I'll try to keep this short. I (19f) slept over at my boyfriends (23m) place, and I unexpectedly got my period during the night (irregular cycle). He freaked out. I was embarrassed, and offered to wash the sheets. He wasn't having any of it, and basically told me I must be irresponsible and disgusting, yelling the whole time. At that point I got annoyed too, and told him he was acting like a real asshole. I went to take a quick shower and was about to go home when he stopped me to continue the argument. I explained to him that I can't control when they happen, that they can be irregular as hell, and that they're not that gross (he was talking about throwing away the sheets, the stain wasn't even that big and I put them in the washer before I showered.) He told me that he didn't know those things, and that I'm unreasonable for being mad at him for just a misunderstanding, and that he couldn't have known since they didn't teach him that in school. Obviously I'm not mad at him for not knowing, I'm mad at him for assuming he knew better and reacting by yelling at me. He's mad because.. I'm mad, and he thinks I can't be mad about ignorance, since it's not his fault. I apologised for calling him an asshole, but he doesn't want to apologise for yelling. AITA? I only want him to apologise for yelling."

Mazel tov” and reached her hand toward my belly. I moved away from her, yet she still managers to reach her hand and pat my belly. I was annoyed, so then I touched her belly and repeated it back to her, and then she got mad. People should not touch either men’s nor women’s bellies without permission, but it was also wrong that she made fun of me for being fat. AITA?"
534,Not the A-hole,AITA For not considering my parents adopted children as my siblings and not being willing to take them in if something happens to my parents,20762,hon97j,2975,"I know the title probably makes me sound horrible, but there is a lot more to the story.So my parents had me very late in their lives after a crapton of tries and being told they could not have kids. Well here I am, but my dad was 51 and my mom 45 when I was born.Despite their age they were amazing parents, loving, caring, strict but fair and they were in a very good financial position in large part due to their age, so they put me through very good schools and paid my tuition to Uni and so on, in other words I had a great youth and was set up for success.Well I am 26 now, I am doing well for myself, however the problem started 3 years ago. They missed having me in the house, it felt empty they said so they were considering adoption from another country where laws are more lacking as in our country their age would likely prevent them from even being considered, I told them that this was a horrible idea due to thrir age.Last year they succeeded in adopting a little girl and her brother aged 3 and 5 and I have only met them a few times so far all times they were extremely shy and frankly, I am not close to them at all as I live halfway across the country so obviously I do not consider them my siblings but more so as my parents kids.Issue is my dad is now 77 and my mom is 71, they are still very fit for their age and have a live in nanny to help out, but lets be honest, they are in the agegroup where it is likely the end is near.So I visited them a week ago and asked them what their plans were for the kids if they die before they are adults and they were pretty much lost for words, looked confused and answered ""Obviously you will take them in, you are their brother."" I pretty much had the same rwaction as they had to my question and told them there was no way, I hardly know them, I am not close to them, I do not consider them my siblings and I certainly wont take care of two kids.Went over about as well as you can expect, loads of yelling and screaming which led to me leaving, I have not spoken to them since apart from my mom sending me messages to reconsider. Obviously I do feel bad though, there is no one else who can take care of them, no other family, no close friends, just me, so they'll end up in the foster system. But Am I the Asshole?"
535,Not the A-hole,AITA For Not Punishing or Reporting Student,20751,l9aho0,1161,"I am a teacher. A parent sent me screenshots of her daughter's text messages. A student of mine who is a boy [13M] had texted a girl who is also my student [13F].This was the conversation:Boy: Hey, its ""boy's name"". I really like you.Girl: Umm what do you mean?Boy: I have a crush on you. Do you want to maybe date?Girl: No I don't like you sorry.Boy: Oh okThis was the extent of his pursuit of her. The mother said they are way too young to date and said that this was harrassment. She wanted me to punish or report the boy and remove him from the class.I told her those demands are ridiculous, it wasn't harrassment because he accepted her saying no, and that its fairly common middle school stuff. She was pissed and said I need to do my job."
536,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling my aunt a fcking idiot and searching her room?,20749,htnyi3,990,"My aunt and cousin are staying with my family for a little while. I have asthma, and I take pills for it every night.Yesterday morning my cousin came up to me and asked if I could stop taking my pills because it triggers her. Anyone else in the world, I would’ve said no. But my cousin is a recovering drug addict, so I said I can take it in another room but I still have to take it. She got mad but left me alone.Night came when I was supposed to take my meds, I leave my meds on my desk so I know where it is. I went to my desk to grab it and it was gone. I asked everyone in my house if they had taken it, and they said no.I had this feeling in my gut, like I already knew what happened. I went into the room my aunt and cousin were staying in, and started searching. Looked in the bedside table. There they were, my meds. My aunt walked in right as I was going to take them, and started screaming at me about going into ‘her’ room. (Last i check this was still my parents house) She grabbed the meds out of my hand and said it’s really difficult for my cousin not to relapse when she knows I’m taking pills (dude. They’re pink and bubble gum flavored they’re barely even pills) She said that I’m going to have to do with out my meds while they were there. Now lemme just say, my aunt is one of those crazy, anti vax, essential oil, type bitch. She doesn’t believe in asthma.So, I snatched my meds out of her hand and called her a fucking idiot. Because I can’t breathe if I don’t take those meds.She got angry and told my mom that I called her a fucking idiot and searched the room. My mom took away my phone.AITA?(I take 5mg of montelukast for anyone wondering)(Mom and aunt are in their 40’s. I’m 14. My cousin is 17)Please don’t bash my mom. She’s punished me for the cursing, and I don’t think she got the whole story. Also for the people asking, my mom and dad were on a date when I noticed my meds were gone)(Update: i told my mom the whole story. She gave me back my phone then sent me to my room while her and my dad talked to my aunt and cousin.)(Update 2, my mom told my aunt to apologize or she’s getting kicked out)(Hey guys this is kinda unrelated, but there’s a little red checkered shield by my username. What does that mean?)(Thank you for the awards guys! )"
537,Not the A-hole,AITA for suddenly disinviting my father 4 days before my wedding ? He even paid for my wedding and I haven't spoken to him since.,20721,g7fdye,1172,"Just to be clear, I got married in early February. I have always been very close to my father and stepmom growing up. I always felt like they offered me a stable home for me to grow up in. I never had that with my mother. During the last few years of my parents' marriage, my mother changed as a person. She was a happy and cheerful person when we were younger. She really changed after the divorce. She was miserable, and I felt that. I could tell that she hated the fact that I preferred to live with my dad, but never verbalized her feelings.She has been single since the divorce, and refuses to date other people. I always wanted to have joint birthday parties with my mom, dad and stepmom, but my mom wouldn't have it. She avoided my father like the plague. I never understood her behavior and resented her for it.Quite naturally, I preferred my dad's household over my mom's. Anyways, right before my wedding, I was staying at my dad's.One night, I overheard my dad and stepmom reminiscing about how they met. Now they always told us that they met 6 months after the divorce at a library. Turns out, they lied.They were talking about how my father couldn't take his eyes off her the moment she walked into his office and how he wanted her from that moment on, and how he didn't care that he had a pregnant wife at home.Apparently their first kiss was a few days after I was born, and the first time they had sex was on my parents' 3rd anniversary. I was only a few months old back then. They were talking about how difficult it was for them to continue their relationship after they got caught when I was 5. This was extremely shocking to me because my parents got divorced when I was 10. They were also making fun of my mom's weight.This meant that they carried on an affair throughout my parents' marriage. I remember my mom changing for the worse when I was in second grade.My mom always knew and she never told me. I broke down crying that night and I felt really guilty because of the way I acted towards my mom growing up. I had no idea she went through so much. I was cheated on by my first boyfriend in college and it destroyed me. I felt horrible. That night, I didn't confront my dad but the next morning, I packed my shit up and transferred the amount he had spent on my wedding. I didn't want his money. I told him I heard every thing and asked him to stay away from my wedding.I left their house and drove to my mom's. I hugged her really hard and we both cried.I had my mom walk me down the aisle, and I made sure my dad's family didn't attend the wedding. I didn't explicitly disinvite my half brother, but he stayed away from my wedding and I'm actually glad be didn't come.I don't think I want anything to do with any of them anymore.I've heard from the grapevine that my dad is on anti depressants nowadays. My grandma blames me for his depression. Did I overreact? I still don't want anything to do with him. My dad's family think I was and I am being cruel to him. AITA?**corrected a typo****for the people doubting it's fake, I'm not quoting what I heard, I'm paraphrasing what they were talking about. I'm stating the things I got to know that night. And yes, they were drinking. People got that right**"
538,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking my roommate out for something that her friend did?,20708,haq9ie,1262,"I am a 37 year old man and my roommate is an early-30s woman. I rent a two-bedroom house and it had a spare room, so I decided to look for a roommate last year. I had a couple of people interested, but a friend asked me for a favor and I let her move in. She pays about 30% of the rent because that's all she can afford.My roommate has one particularly good friend who she invites over regularly. I do not like that woman at all. She is loud, self-centered, and has no concept of boundaries, property, or privacy. She has ""accidentally"" eaten my food and drunk my beer several times when she came over, and I have voiced my opinion about her to my roommate regularly. My roommate's response has always been ""as long as I'm paying my part of the rent, the company I keep is between them and me."" On Saturday night, she invited her friend over. As I often am in my room, I was completely naked, lying over my covers, reading a book. I like being naked and expect a reasonable amount of privacy from civilized people. When my roommate was in the bathroom, my door door flew open like it was rammed by a siege engine. Her friend had barged in to ""surprise"" me, and instead of frantically apologizing for violating my privacy (and seeing me naked), she burst out laughing as I fumbled to cover myself. By now my roommate had come out of the bathroom, and her friend shouted to her ""I saw his little ____!"" My roommate snort-laughed loudly.The next morning my roommate was hung over, and so I told her that her time in the house was over and that she had a month to vacate. I looked up the laws in my state, and since I am the only person on the lease, I can legally kick her out as long as I give her proper notice. She told me that she warned her roommate about privacy after what happened, and I told her I don't care at all. She brought that woman into the house, she was entertained by my embarrassment, and I wasn't comfortable living with her for another day. I told her if it were legal I'd kick her out that second.My roommate has been nasty with me all week, saying that she has nowhere to go. I don't care and keep telling her that she might want to start looking. Our mutual friend who I originally did the favor for has sided with her completely, and so I just blocked him.Am I going too far here, or am I not the asshole in this case?"
539,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to financially help my family after they abandoned me even if it means they’ll end up homeless?,20702,iepi4i,1481,"I feel like this is such a cliché reddit story but I’m really struggling with what to do here so..I am my mother’s oldest biological child. When I was 5 my father passed away and she remarried my step-“dad” when I was 8. When I was 9 I was sent away to live with my father’s sister who lived states away because her husband didn’t want me to live there anymore. They used to pay my aunt some money to watch me but when I was 14 that stopped. My aunt and uncle worked low paying jobs and had two of their own children, so they really couldn’t afford the extra expense of having me around without that help. Despite that, they let me stay and continued to treat me like one of their own. I very rarely saw my mom, I think I saw her 5 times between 9 and 18. She never even called. She went on to have three more children (19M, 18F and 16M) with my stepdad. Growing up I used to stalk my siblings and parents on social media to see what their life was like and it was polar opposite to mine. They regularly went on expensive vacations, lived in a massive house and owned the latest gadgets, etc.  I went to college and got married at 23. My mother/siblings have no idea I’m married. I’m currently 28 and doing well financially. My husband and I own our own home, we have several very profitable investments and work high paying jobs. My cousins (30F and 27F) and I all contributed to help my aunt/uncle to finally purchase their own home last year. Recently, my mom showed up to my aunt’s house begging for financial help. Apparently, my stepdad suffered from a gambling addiction a few years ago and lost all their savings. Now with COVID he’s lost his job and they can’t afford to keep their house without help. My aunt explained she didn’t have any money to help her and when my mother demanded to know how she could afford her new house if she had no money, she explained what me and my cousins had done. My mom then asked for my number. When she called me and explained the situation. I told her I couldn’t help. She kept begging me and claimed my siblings would be made homeless if I didn’t help them. I told her maybe she should sell some of their fancy stuff or they could all get jobs like my cousins and I had to. I hung up before she could reply. Since then I have been receiving message after message from my mom, my siblings and even my stepdad begging me for help. I have NEVER spoken to my siblings in my life. They’ve begun harassing my husband and my SIL. They’ve also reached out to my aunt and cousins multiple times trying to get them to convince me to change my mind.I’m SO angry with them all. They threw me away and when they need something, they come crawling back? But the guilt is also starting to set in an I don’t know if I’m being an asshole. Am I?"
540,Not the A-hole,AITA for not giving my cat for adoption because my GF has a phobia?,20689,huppsn,2159,"My GF of two years is scared of cats, and I mean REALLY scared of cats. I have had this cat for 7 years. At first when she came to my place I had to take the cat outside, close all windows or doors and make sure my cat didn't sneak up to play with me or something like that. Long story short, she couldn't take it anymore and told me that she feels really uncomfortable knowing that there is a cat lurking around and that she wouldn't come to my place again if I didnt get rid of my cat. We tried therapy but it looks like the therapy is for me to cope with the loss of my pet.,I don't want to give my cat away so last saturday we talked about this and broke up ..Now I feel like shit for ruining my relationship.

It is hard to understand that things and plans sometimes doesn't work or go the way we want and that is fine, that is life. It is harder when feelings are involved. "
541,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling people I’m not the celebrity they think I am?,20683,ebtbnn,2299,"I look very similar to an actor and I live in New York City. Every so often a tourist would stop me and say “oh my gosh you’re that guy!” And I used to interrupt them and say “no I’m really not.”But then this guy started starring in a TV show so became way more recognizable. It started so I was being stopped 3-5 times a day by people. Once I was in a mad rush and on the phone so when someone said “Aaahhhh you’re that guy can I take a selfie” I just smiled for the selfie and said have a great day. It was faster than explaining and insisting I’m not the guy while they accuse me of being too big for the fans, it was kind of funny to think of a picture of me floating around as a celebrity, and it was kind of nice to see how happy they looked when they thought they’d met this guy even for ten seconds. So now when people stop me I just take picture or shake their hand and move on. I thought it was just funny and never really thought much beyond that. But I was on a date the other night and the girl said “hey has anyone ever told you you look like that guy from that show” and I told her this story and she was horrified. She said it was so mean to mislead people that way. That hadn’t occurred to me and I really don’t want to be a dick to people, I thought it was something they’d eventually look back on and laugh too. Didn’t occur to me it would be so upsetting. So is she being oversensitive or am I being an asshole to tourists?"

I have wanted to change so many things in my life and I couldn’t because I was and am an alcoholic... this group of friends is nothing but drinking. I can’t do it anymore I need to change my destiny, my legacy. I’ve tried to tell them numerous times but they always pressure me with the “one last time” thing and I was weak and always went for it.A few weeks ago it was my birthday, my 29th birthday. They all ganged up and me and convinced me to go out drinking. Well stay home and drink. So I decided to do it and it was a mistake. The entire time I was regretting the decision and as I got drunker and drunker I got sadder that I was doing it. A few days ago I sent a group text to all my friend and basically told them that I’ve tried to get sober for years and it’s incredibly hard and as friends I would have thought they’d be happy for me and supportive but instead they do the opposite and pressure me to drink. they know drinking gets in the way of my plans for my life but it seems they don’t care. Anyways I told them that I am moving forward with my life and as of now I don’t see any of them in my future. I’ve gotten calls and texts but have ignored them all. I feel better I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders but at the same time I can’t help but feel like I was kind of a dick.. and I the wrong one here?"
543,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving my fiance over his reaction to me getting a student suspended,20652,aylk38,905,"I am a librarian at a prek-12 school. I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.For any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say ""watch your hands!"" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.One day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, ""LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL."" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.I told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a ""joke."" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.I tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?Edit: thanks for your responses everyone, especially those of you PMing me telling me to kill myself or that I’m an emotional bitch who should listen to the logical men or I will die alone :)))))) love u all"
544,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to return a computer I bought after the store called and told me that I paid the wrong price for it?,20637,jzuz57,2340,"Last week, I went to a local pawn shop to sell some stuff. While I was there, I was window shopping and saw that they had a computer for $89. I only really use a computer for youtube or websites and my laptop is pretty old so I tested this computer, everything worked so I bought it. The next day, I got a call and it was from the manager of the shop. He was very rude from the start and told me that the computer was labeled incorrectly and told me(didn't ask, rudely ordered me) to come in that day and either A.) return the computer or B.) pay the difference. I asked that the difference was and he said over $800. I guess it was supposed to be labeled $899. I said I'd think about it and he said that if I wasn't in by the end of the day, he'd just charge my card the amount. I told him that he can't do that and he said if I didn't bring it in, or pay the difference, he was gonna ban me from the store and also call the police for theft. I just said I'd thnk about it again. I think he was mad cause the last thing he said to me was ""listen, b\*\*\*ch, either bring it in or go to jail, your choice"". Or ""you decide"". Something like that. Then ended the call. I don't think the police can even do anything cause the price sticker is still on the computer and I have a receipt of the transaction for the $89 and there's probably also camera footage of me buying it and he must have a record of the purchase too. It's not my fault that him or an employee labeled it incorrectly and it's not like I knew it was a wrong price when I bought it. I just saw a cheap computer that worked and bought it. I asked my friend who's into computers to look at it and see if it's actually worth that much or if this guy's just trying to scam me or something and he said that the parts are pretty high end and expensive. I don't think I did anything wrong but my friend said that I should take it back so idk."
545,Not the A-hole,AITA for going out in a pair of shorts?,20615,fmfd13,622,"So I (23M) am covered in burn scars over every inch of my body with the exception of my face, neck and back. For context, my house went on fire when I was 10 and I was lucky to survive. It was obviously traumatising and after a long time of hating my body, I became an alcoholic in my teens to cope. When I was 20, I went drunk driving, crashed my car and my right leg was amputated from the knee and I’ve worn a prosthetic leg ever since.Since it’s March, the weather is warmer now and I had to go out to get some standard shopping so I on instinct wore a jumper and shorts with it as it’s not cold out. On full display was my prosthetic and my badly scarred left leg. I should  also note I received a skin graft on that leg, so some of the skin is more visible and scarred than other portions.Anyway, I decided to take a little walk before going to the store and I cut through a park. There isn’t much people around but there’s a few out. I got a couple of stares but that’s normal and I got to the store. I browsed for the stuff I needed like normal and when I got to checkout, there was a huge queue. I was expecting this so I was waiting and eventually, a mom and her son of about 3/4 went in line behind me. Nothing was said but I could feel the kid staring at me and he eventually started crying.I then get a pat on my shoulder from the mom asking if I’d let them go in front of me so they wouldn’t have to stare at my “deformed leg” and my “robot one” as I was really upsetting her kid. I got really offended and told her that I wasn’t letting her skip and that some people happen to have visible deformities and that I’m allowed to wear shorts. My turn eventually came but she called me an AH and being inconsiderate to her kids feelings. AITA?"
546,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my mother that it's her own fault she'll never get biological children?,20600,hueojs,1284,"Edit: Just noticed the error in the title... **GrandchildrenI'm in my early thirties. I got my first period when I was nine years old and they've always been.. gruesome. More blood than anyone could ever imagine, cramping so bad that I had to miss school and couldn't eat or drink or do anything because the pain was so bad. In my mother's eyes... I was a faker. Making things up for attention or to get out of tests. She refused to take me to see doctors or anything. I wasn't even allowed pain meds. Well, when I moved in with my then boyfriend at 27, he convinced me to GO SEE A DOCTOR because that wasn't healthy. And I did. I later got diagnosed with a rare reproductive issue (vague for privacy) that essentially could have been fixed if caught earlier. But it wasn't. The issue had gone on for long enough that the damage was pretty almosy irreparable. In the end, I was basically given the choice of surgery A, which would leave me infertile, with less complications and a lower fatality rate, or surgery B, which would leave me fertile, but with a higher risk of complications/death due to the severity of my issue.I chose surgery A. I can no longer have biological children. My then boyfriend and I are now married, and we're looking into other options to have a child. We're heavily leaning towards adoption, and I confided in my mother about this. Big mistake. She started scolding me and basically told me that I HAD to have biological children. She told me if I didn't have bio kids then I was a failure of a woman, and ""HOW DARE YOU LET THE BLOODLINE DIE!"" or something like that. She told me that if we adopted, then she would do everything in her power to make me and my husband look like terrible people so it fails. And, the icing on the cake, she told me that I should just ""Reverse The Surgery."" I can't do that. It's physically impossible. It's not like getting my tubes tied. I literally no longer have a uterus or ovaries or any of it. There is NO WAY TO ""reverse"" this surgery. I went off on her. I explained that, and I explained that if she were a competent parent who actually did her job, then I wouldnt be infertile. I explained that if she had taken me to see doctors sooner, I wouldn't have to consider adoption. I called her a terrible mom and a terrible person, and I told her that if I ever do adopt a child, she would never get to meet them. She went silent, and then hung up. Hasn't said a word to me since. But now every woman in my family is calling me a useless bitch and a horrible daughter. Even family I havent seen since I was a baby. Now I'm wondering if I went too far or something. Reddit, AITA?Edit: Something several people have brought up now is how come I didn't go to the doctor before I was 27. For nine years my mom told me that I was overreacting and that I was a faker and that what I was going through was normal, I was just overreacting. That kind of conditioning is really hard to get over. And for a long, long time my mom was the only woman in my life who was actually aware of periods and things.  Sure, if id gone earlier, my condition likely wouldn't have been as bad, but I still would have suffered. Honest to God, I had no one in my life to tell me that my symptoms were absolutely not normal. Until I moved in with my husband. He witnessed firsthand what one of my periods looked like and told me that if I didn't go to see a doctor, he'd drag me to one by my belt loops. My point is, I never went to see a doctor before I was 27 because I was brainwashed into thinking I was overdramatic.Edit 2: WOW. this got a lot more attention then I thought it would. So, I'm gonna comment on some stuff. 1) Thanks for the awards! 2) To everyone wishing me well, thank you so much, I appreciate all the kind words. 3) to all the women and men who've had to deal with undiagnosed health problems and/or toxic families, my heart bleeds for all of you. I hope the best for all of your life situations. 4) If you think you have a medical issue, especially if you're female, stick to it. Go to a doctor, two doctors, five doctors. Find someone who will listen to you. Admittedly, I struck gold in that my doctors actually listened to me and were speedy about diagnosing me, but many aren't. Remember, you know your body better than anyone and if something is wrong, push the issue! 5) I am going to look into therapy- I feel like I absolutely could benefit from it. This post and some of the comments are making me consider some of my mother's behavior through my life and I really need to think things over about her and my plans going forward. I'm considering limited contact unless she can prove she deserves otherwise.6) Yes, my husband is amazing and I'm so lucky to have him 💞7) I've messaged most of my extended family explaining to them my side of the story. Most haven't seen the message yet, but the majority of the ones who have read it have apologized to me for not asking my side of the story first. 8) Should I have gone to the doctor before age 27? Yes. Would it have lessened the severity of my issue? Most likely. Why didn't I? Because my mother gaslit me. I fully accept that I should've gone. But I didn't because of her actions in my teenage years. I consider her at least half to blame in this aspect.9) Do I think I'm an asshole? Now, no! When i wrote this, and before? Of course I did. Half my family was bullying me. Sue me."
547,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I said something to my sons prek about him not getting a single egg at their egg hunt today?,20593,benjes,2100,"So I'm pretty pissed off right now. My son is 3 and goes to a pre k program with some kids upt age 5. Today they had a nice Easter egg hunt. I had to work today so I couldn't attend but they asked each kids parent send at least 14 eggs for the hunt. I love school functions like this. I wish I could have been there. So we sent some extra eggs with him and some cupcakes. His father got there late. Well he just texted me saying he didnt get one damn egg. The bigger kids just steam rolled the smaller kids and all had 30+ eggs each. He said he got there right when they started and our son was pushed over by the bigger kids and just started crying. He didnt get a single egg. The teachers didnt supervise this at all. I'm not saying he needed a lot of eggs, but one fucking egg. Hes the only kid with no eggs. My SO said they're now sitting there our so  is crying as all the other kids are opening eggs. I'm beyond pissed they didnt supervise this better. I need to know of I'm over reacting before I call up there and just let them have a piece of my mind."
548,Not the A-hole,"AITA for ""backing out"" of an agreement I never made?",20582,kpsy8o,1601,"2 months ago my Dad (54M) approached me with an opportunity to buy a female labrador puppy from his friend (let's call him Joe) who shows and breeds pedigree labradors. According to my Dad, Joe was offering me the labrador puppy for a heavily discounted rate ($80) because I was his friends daughter. Nothing else was mentioned to me about why the puppy was so cheap but I assumed my Dads friend Joe was just being generous. Looking back I was definitely naive but I'd been wanting a labrador pup for a long time and the offer was just too good to pass up. That same day I drove over 2 hours to Joes farm to collect my new 3 month old labrador puppy and sign the paperwork transferring the ownership of the pup to me. Joe never mentioned anything else about the terms of the sale and I never signed any other paperwork or contract regarding further terms. I want to stress that in the period directly after the sale, neither Joe or my Dad discussed with me the apparent ""extra terms"" I had supposedly agreed to. Until recently. I mentioned to my Dad that I had booked Jennifer (name of pup) for her desexing next month and my Dad immediately told me I had to cancel. He went on to explain that he had agreed (on my behalf) to allow Joe to use my labrador to breed more pups for him to sell. This is apparently why I was able to buy Jennifer for such a discounted rate.  I was shocked but frankly not surprised since my Dad has a long history of neglecting tomention important details/lying by omission.As far as I'm concerned, I never agreed to these terms so I'm not bound to them. Dad and Joe may have had a verbal agreement but I am the legal owner of Jennifer and there was no verbal (or written) agreement between me and Joe so I don't care. I called Joe and made it crystal clear to him that I absolutely was NOT planning to breed Jennifer, let alone give him the puppies to sell. He was upset, called me a few choice names, and demanded I pay back the difference between the discounted rate and the normal rate for Jennifer since I wasn't breeding her for him. I refused because I legally own Jennifer now and the sale is over. If he wanted me to breed Jennifer he should have talked to me about this personally because I was the buyer, not my Dad. Joe is apparently fuming, my Dad is angry because he doesn't understand why its a big deal, and other extended family members who know Joe think I'm being a bitch and should at least pay him back the difference. But I honestly just don't feel like I'm obligated to. It's their fault , especially Joe, for not mentioning these extra terms to me before the sale. He's the seller and he show know better when conducting his business. Also according to the ""agreement"" I would have to breed Jennifer whenever Joe wanted (so I'm guessing nonstop). Plus Joe would not have to pay for Jennifers medical expenses when pregnant and that would all come out of my pocket. Hard pass."
549,Not the A-hole,AITA for not taking a joke that my boyfriend made?,20571,hkqq8p,736,"On mobile, sorry... My boyfriend and I met a few friends for drinks this evening. He was finishing some work, so I left the flat first, and he met up with us later on. On our walk home, he abruptly asked me if I had the key. Small context: our lock recently broke and until it’s properly replaced, we have a temporary lock and only one key. Typically the rule is that the last person to leave the flat takes the key, unless we know that one of us will be home earlier. I said I didn’t, because I assumed he would take it, as he left the flat last.He became extremely upset and agitated. He demanded why I hadn’t taken the key, and said that he was sure I’d used it last and so must have lost it or misplaced it, causing him to forget it. He repeatedly said things along the lines of “we’re fucked because of you, you realise that?” and “I can’t believe you did this.” Towards the beginning, I assumed he was joking and laughed a little, which prompted him to snarl “you think this is a fucking joke?? You locked us out! You lost the key!” This continued for over five minutes. By the time we got to the flat, I was nearly crying. We stood outside of the flat for another few minutes while my boyfriend berated me. He made me peek over one of the windows, to look at the space where we normally leave the key. He said, “It’s not there, is it? Right. And whose fault is that?”I sat down on the front steps and was burying my face in my hands and thought I was going to be sick. Finally he said, “Alright then. Let’s go inside.” When I looked up, he was taking the key out of his pocket. It was all a joke.He’s now genuinely angry at me because I went directly to shower and have been very quiet for the remainder of the evening. He says I can’t take a joke. I hate being the humourless bitch, but I really feel this went beyond a joke. Am I being an overly sensitive asshole? Tldr: Boyfriend spent 5-10 minutes berating me for losing the key. Turns out he had the key. I’m hurt and annoyed. AITA?EDIT: I went to sleep and woke up to all of this, and my post is locked for some reason so I’m not able to reply. I promise to read everything and reply to all the DMs! I’m sorry if it looks like I’m ignoring everyone!!!Editing this on 5 July because the post is locked and I can’t reply to anyone....- We’ve had an on and off relationship for about two years now. I’m usually the one to “come back” because I have dependency issues and miss him too much. - Stuff like this happens frequently. His inability to apologise is his worst trait. The incident in the post hit different because I truly felt I did nothing wrong and couldn’t believe things fell apart so fast. -  I spoke with him about it the following morning. He said he wasn’t to blame for my overreaction and that I owed him an apology for giving him a hard time over a joke. We didn’t speak for most of the day and now things are more or less back to normal."
550,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to call my dad’s girlfriend ‘mom’ or obeying her rules?,20560,eh6n83,1990,"Edit:Wow!! I’ve never expected this post to blow up like this. I expected about 10 reactions First of all: Thank you so so much for your comments, all of the amazing advise and support, and all of the DM’s. (and the rewards!)  You are amazing people and its actually hard for me to put in words how I feel about this. It’s great to read all kinds of opinions on this! though I haven’t been able to read all comments and DM’s yetMy current plan is to firstly have a talk alone with my dad. I want to share my feelings with him about this situation. Then I want the three of us (without my brothers) to talk. If that doesn’t work, I’ll try to find a professional to help us out to find a solution :) One way or another, I’ll find someone to support me in the mourning process. I’ve already contacted my uncle for help. TBH I am kinda overwhelmed by the number of comments and DM’s and this is not an easy process for me. Sorry if I’m slow to respond :) \---------------------------------------Original post:Throwaway because some people might recognize me.I (17M) currently live in my fathers house, my brothers (13 and 11) live there too. I’ve always had a great bond with my mother, but she died about two years ago, which deeply traumatized me.Half a year later, my dad started to date someone else, let’s call her Elise (32f), she’s currently living at our place as well. Don’t get me wrong, Elise is not a bad person. My brothers really needed someone to cling to and she really takes good care for them. She makes dad smile again.However, she is a lot more controlling than my mom was. I am quite independent, do chores around the house, have friends and go out etc. But she insists that I should follow her rules, to be home at a certain time etc. I don’t like that. I’m used to have more freedom and am actually planning to move out next year, I don’t want to risk losing my friends over her controlling behavior. I am respectful towards her, trying not to pick a fight, but she’s not someone I would want to share me feelings with.She also insists that I call her ‘mom’ like my brothers do but I refuse. For me there was only one mother in my life and calling Elise mom just feels wrong, as if I’m forgetting my real mom. I also feel like if I call her mom I would accept that she has authority over me, but I never chose this person, my dad did. My dad just wants everyone to get along and live a happy new family but is afraid of confrontation and in general just lacks a spine. He also doesn’t like it if anyone mentions my real mom so I can barely talk to him about her.Elise has called me an unruly teenager multiple times. When I got home ‘late’ she gets angry. Among other things she’s told me at times that I refuse to accept her even though she’s trying, that I am the one thing stopping this family from being happy again. That I’m confusing my brothers by refusing to call her mom (which I doubt). I told her she should accept that I’m not a kid, that I’m still getting over the loss of someone she hasn’t even met. That the only mom I ever had is not here anymore and that if anyone could set rules on me, it would be my dad. One time when she was furious she told me to ‘get over it already’. I told her to go fuck herself, she has no idea what I went through.So, AITA?"
551,Not the A-hole,AITA for not paying for my daughters wedding after she went no contact with me?,20572,kgacpq,1362,"I payed college tuition for all three of my kids(27f, 29f, 32m) because I have the money and I wanted to. My older two studied Computer Science while my youngest one decided to study Fashion Design. I wasn’t really supportive about the Fashion Design degree at first and tried to warn my daughter that the job prospects for it wouldn’t be that great but she was insistent that, that was what she wanted to study so I paid approx. 60k for her to get her degree. However, afterwards she struggled finding a job in her field and the one’s she did find didn’t pay well so she came back to me and asked me to help her get another degree. I told her I could help her take out a loan but I wasn’t paying and it caused a lot of problems between us and she went no contact. She ended up going to community college part time while working as a server with the help of her boyfriend.I helped my older two pay for their weddings and my youngest daughter recently got engaged. She started talking to me and her mom again and we were excited about the wedding. However, she started planning for things way out of her budget that her older sister/brother were able to have at their weddings. Her mom and I were worried that this wedding would not be good for her financially and decided to talk to her about it. My younger daughter told us she thought we would pay for most of it and was planning on having a high end wedding close to what my elder two had. My wife and I told her we were not going to drop 30k to pay for her wedding after she went years of no contact with us. Furthermore, my elder two paid for most of their own wedding, we just pitched in about 5k for each of them. They both make good money, well into the six-figure range. My younger one got super angry with us and complained how it wasn’t fair that her siblings got better things than she did and said we were playing favorites. AITA for not paying for her wedding?"
552,Not the A-hole,AITA for making my husband take over for a day so I can play video games?,20559,js23h7,2663,"Hello reddit! Long time lurker, but I felt like you might be able to tell me if I was in the wrong here.I am a mom of 4. I know, that's alot of kids, but I wouldn't change it. The kids are 10m, 9f, 6m, and 2m. I am a stay at home mom while my husband works m-f 9-5. His saturdays are pretty relaxed, he hangs out with the kids, then goes out with the boys that night. Sunday is church and a family dinner. My weeks are the complete opposite. I dont relax. I'm 100% overwhelmed and %150 stressed to the max. My normal, daily schedule is5:30: wakeup, shower, coffee in silence6:30: set out clothes, wake up house7:30: cook/tend to 2 year old8:00: eating, make husbands lunch.8:30: get kids logged on and set up for school.9-11: breakfast cleanup, help kids with school, entertain 2 year old, light cleaning, fix snacks11-12:30: fix lunch, feed kids, take kids out to play while tending garden1-3: deep cleaning 1 room, entertain kids3-4: laundry4-5:30: dinner prep and cooking5-6: feed everyone6-7: run errands/after dinner cleanup7-8: bathtime/snacks, bedtime routine8-9: get kids in bed9-10: clean then sleepThis finally came to a head this last friday when my husband got upset with me for complaining that I was tired. I asked him what he did every day that hes too tired to help out and maybe that's why I am exhausted, that I do everything. I havent had a break since my 2 year old was born. He told me I didnt need a break, that it's easy to do my job. I ended up screaming that the next day, he is tending to the house and kids and that I was locking myself in our room and playing video games all day.True to my word, I refused to unlock the door saturday or do anything. My MIL called me pissed that I could do that to my family and that I was the AH for ignoring my family to play games. I told her that maybe if she raised her son better, it wouldnt have came to this. My husband is angry, my mil is angry and I feel like the AH. AITAEdit:My husband is a web developer. When he gets home, he sits down and relaxes for the rest of the evening. He doesnt entertain the kids, he doesnt help with the house, he relaxes because hes worked so hard and is exhausted.My kids do not get fed junk food, Kraft meals, or frozen meals. I make everything from scratch because its healthier. They get 30 minutes-1 hour of screen time a day. They do have small chores that help alittle but I do all of the big stuffI have tried to talk to him about this before and have laid out exactly what can be done to help me. I get ignored"
553,Not the A-hole,AITA for helping my child leave home and telling my ex wife that she's the reason our daughter hates her?,20549,k39s40,1091,"My ex wife and I split about 6 years ago. We have one child together, Sarah (18). Now, Sarah is a trans woman and came out when she was 14. I am extremely happy that she felt comfortable enough to be herself but my ex didn't agree. She was happy when we thought we had a gay son but she couldn't accept the fact that we actually have a daughter.When we first split, I moved into a crappy one bedroom flat in a pretty rough area, I have since moved into a bungalow in a slightly better area. I didn't want Sarah having to come to that area so she stayed with her mum and I would visit her, take her out and phone her everyday. My ex was going out of her way to call Sarah 'he/him' and would use her old name constantly. She even went as far as joking about how it was 'just her luck that she'd have a tr\*\*\*y for a child'. However, though it was absolutely disgusting, Sarah told me it was okay and at the very, very least she wasn't in any physical danger. I figured I'd deal with this until I found a better place. I'd offered to let Sarah take my room and I'd sleep on the couch but she wouldn't hear of it.Two months ago. Sarah phoned me one night in absolute tears. She had been growing her hair out for ages, and at the rate her hair grows it reaches just below her shoulders. She was thrilled.That night, my ex had offered to give her hair a little trim. She told Sarah it was to just cut off some of the dead ends. Sarah immediately said yes as this would help tidy her hair up a little bit and she had thought this was her mum's was of trying to accept her. She wasn't.My ex cut a massive chunk out of her hair, bringing it back to just above her neck. Sarah was absolutely gutted. She had been working so hard to get to that point. When she told me, I saw red. Over the next couple of weeks I helped Sarah move her things into my house while her mum was out. We made sure we had all of her important documents and such and then I went with her to tell her mum that she was leaving. There was an argument and a few insults thrown but I got Sarah out and she's now living with me. We got her hair cut and styled into a pixie cut until it grows back.Last week, my ex posted on Facebook about her depression. She had been talking about how she had never felt so low and that it was worse that she didn't have anyone at home who could comfort her when she was feeling down. In the comments she mentioned that I 'brainwashed' Sarah into hating her and that if anything happens to her then it's on myself and Sarah for leaving her by herself. I couldn't help myself and posted a lengthy comment about how it was her fault that our daughter hated her and that if she had been a better mother than maybe our daughter would still want to be in her life.Needless to say I've gotten some backlash. Even a few of my friends have said that I was a bit harsh. I don't know what to think here.edit - Okay, firstly I want to say thank you for all the kind and supportive comments, especially in regards to my daughter. I have shown her this thread and you guys genuinely don't know how happy you have made her. I am so grateful for that. Secondly, a  couple of people have asked about what my Facebook comment said. I figured I'd copy and paste it from a previous comment. Some things have been changed/ missed out for privacy reasons but this is the gist of it. ""Just want to clarify for everyone reading this post that Sarah is staying with me of her own accord. My ex had her chance to treat her DAUGHTER with the respect she deserves, accept and love her for who she is and make her feel safe in her own home. She has failed in every aspect.My daughter is staying with me because she feels loved, respected and accepted in my home. I am not a perfect parent and I am not claiming to be. But I, at the very least, work hard to make my daughter feel safe and loved and would never go out of my way to hurt her and make her feel like sh\*t.\*Ex's name\* If you are reading this. YOU failed our daughter. YOU made her feel unloved and unwanted in her own home. YOU made her cry. YOU made her feel worthless. YOU are the reason that our daughter hates you. Not me. Not Sarah. YOU.Maybe if you'd just tried to be accepting and put even a little bit of effort into being a better mother them maybe, just maybe, Sarah would still want you in her life.You screwed it up for yourself. That's no one's fault but your own. I am sorry that you are in a dark place but don't you dare try to pin this on me or my daughter.""As much as I am grateful to all the kind comments, I also accept that I am in the wrong for commenting in the first place. My ex used to do this a lot when we were together, making threats when I tried to leave her. I shouldn't have commented but I let my emotions get the best of me. Also I have found out that her sister is planning to move in with her for a little while, just in case my ex isn't lying. I know it sounds bad but I would rather she was lying as I wouldn't like to see any harm come to her. I wouldn't wish that on anyone.Anyways, apologies for the long edit. Thanks again folks :) "
554,Not the A-hole,AITA for not replacing my sisters $3000 gaming laptop after my child spilled juice on it because it was on the floor?,20525,d24zdo,5029,"Title is pretty self explanatory. But basically over the weekend, I had a work trip to go on so my sister offered to babysit my 2 year old. She’s babysat him a few times so knows what to expect. Well, this time, she left her $3000 gaming laptop *on the floor* of her lounge room. She gave my son an open cup of apple juice without supervision, and he decided to use the laptop as a table on the floor. Things happen and somehow it got knocked over.Her laptop no longer switches on. She’s blaming me and expects me to buy her a new one. I told her no as it shouldn’t have been in his reach and certainly not on the floor. She’s refusing to speak to me at the moment and said she’ll never babysit for me ever again. I really don’t feel as though it’s my responsibility.. AITA?EDIT: Yikes this blew up. A few people have asked for more info. Yes, I packed both a straw cup and sippy cup in my sons bag. I supplied everything he’d need for the weekend - including nappies and food. My parents were originally going to have him but my sister specifically asked if she could so she’d be able to spend time with him. It wasn’t just ‘babysitting’ but more enjoying time with her nephew. I gave her some money if she wanted to get takeout or for extra supplies and she was happy with that as ‘payment’ for watching my son. Every other time she’d had him, the laptop has always been far out of reach."

556,Not the A-hole,AITA For serving my husband's parents pizza on Christmas dinner when they showed up unexpectedly?,20493,knvced,1712,"I F33 am a nurse and I been crazy busy lately. So busy that I'd spend two consecutive days at the hospital. I covered shifts during weekends/holidays for this year. We're not doing well financially and I've only been working for a few months and we have debts to pay for on time.I'm exhausted all the time. I don't get to sleep much. My husband's parents are a.w.a.r.e of my work nature but still acted upset I didn't go shop for their gifts earlier. They did receive gifts from me and I made sure everyone was happy. My husband told me his mom wanted to bring the family and celebrate Christmas at our house. I politely declined and explained that I can't be serving 10+ people when I'm committed to a very demanding. Very strict schedule. My mother in law still pissed at me for this and told the family that I was using my job as an excuse since ""I obviously can't even cook a decent meal let alone host a celebration"". I really thought that they let another family member host Christmas dinner.Christmas day at 2pm I got off work and went home feeling exhausted and could barely take a shower. My husband didn't leave the house and when I asked him about wether his family invited him for dinner he said no because ""I ruined it"" when I refused to let them come. I knew he was starting an argument I just left it at that. At 6pm the door rang and I saw his mom and dad walking in. I greeted them and brought them coffee and biscuits. They said they came to give us our gifts on behalf of the family and they stayed for over two hours. His mom started giving me looks and asking when she and her husband were going to eat dinner. I got up and decided to reheat the pizza we had from the night before and when his mom saw it she stared at me and asked if I was serious, she asked me where is Christmas dinner and was stunned that I didn't cook for the occasion. I told her I didn't cook because I wasn't expecting anyone to be invited to the house. She got upset and said that I should've cooked for the occasion REGARDLESS  of wether we had guests or not because she said it's part of the ""celebration"" and talked about how every home had a Christmas feast. She said I had no ettiquete and that I was clearly Starving her son by not cooking even on holidays.I got into an argument with her while my husband and his dad sat there watching. She called me disrespectful and to stop using my job as an excuse for my lack of function as a wife. Then they left. My husband said I should've taken a few days off and hosted dinner completely ignoring that his mom made a big deal out of it. She's all over the SM talking about me serving her pizza instead of a real Christmas dinner.EDIT/ My husband works in construction. Work has been slow lately he spends more time at home than me. He does cook meals whenever I'm working so I'm not sure why his mom thinks he's being treated unfairly. He's an adult and can cook his own meals. Her problem is with me not preparing her a full Christmas dinner and thinks this stuff more important than work.EDIT/ fixed the word ""ettequate"" because that's how she said it (I laughed inside tbh)"
557,Not the A-hole,AITA? I cut somebody's water off as they were wasting it,20486,gktkkv,1293,"30 years ago my grandfather dug a well. It supplies our home and has a pump to supply water to a mini water tower thing to give our homes water pressure.Another person built a house nearby and there was an agreement for them to plumb into our fresh water supply for limited domestic use: Cooking, cleaning, toilets etc. This agreement has stood for 10 years without any problems.So what's been going wrong? The house next door was sold.It's now starting to get hot. So the next door neighbour has been filling a swimming pool. I don't see a problem with this. What I do see a problem is they fill the pool and drain it EVERY SINGLE DAY.Based on my calculations they're wasting close to 400,000 litres of water every single day. When I told them they can't waste water like this. They told me to f*** myself because the water is free and nobody owns it.So I gave them a warning showing that the water supply belonged to us and it wasn't free at all. I was told to f*** off again. I watched as they filled their pool again AND drained it again. I simply turned off their turned off the valve supplying their home which is on our land. They now have no water whatsoever as they tried to fill their pool again this morning.They're now complaining and whining about not having any water. I told them they can get a tanker to come and fill their pool and supply them.AITA about this?"
558,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my dad to get me feminine products because my boyfriend refused cos he felt too embarrassed?,20490,hsg9a4,2714,"I’m currently on my period and have some bad cramps today. My whole body is aching and I’m feeling very low energy. I’m nearly running out of pads so I kindly asked my bf if he could go down to the local store to get me some pads, chamomile tea and painkillers. He started huffing and puffing and said he wouldn’t get “that stuff” for me. I asked him why and he said it’s too embarrassing. I didn’t have the energy to argue so I texted my dad and asked him if he could get “*that stuff*” for me. He lives nearby and is currently WFH (he was on his lunch break). Fortunately he arrived within 15 minutes and got me everything I needed and then some. My BF got so pissed. He said that just because he refused, it doesn’t mean that I should go running to my dad. I asked him why that’s an issue and he didn’t fully explain himself. He just said that it’s HIS job to get me stuff like that which makes no sense because I asked him and he refused. He was nagging the whole time and I had no patience for that. He continued being moody and said that it was disrespectful of me."
559,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking my friend out of my car and telling her to never call me for a ride?,20474,lgzwgg,1948,"A little back story. I (24m) have a car rock, it used be my grandfathers and he would always have it in his car as a ""lucky totem"" and had it for about 30 years according to my mom, but he passed away when I was around 5. I don't have much to remember him besides a few pictures of us, his ring, a knife and this rock. When I turned 18 my mom gave me the knife, ring and rock because my grandfather wanted me to receive these on my 18th birthday. I keep his knife in my room, wear the ring everyday and in the past 6 years I've had kept that rock in my car too and kept it as a lucky totem as well. Sometimes when I drive ill have the rock in my hand and just rub my thumb over and it kind of gives me peace of mind. I don't really know how to explain it in words I guess.So onto the story. This happened last night. My friend ""Jane""(26F) car is currently in the shop for repairs of a accident (she got rear ended and it messed up her whole back end). So the past week she's has either been ubering or asking friends to pick her up when her shift is done and thats around 730 pm. Her work is about 30 minutes away from me and she lives about 10 minutes from me. So last night she called me at 7pm and asked me if I could pick her up and so I said sure no big deal. So I pick her up and everything was fine until I picked up  my rock and staring rubbing it, Jane asked what was in my hand. I showed it to her and said ""this is my lucky rock I sometimes rub it whenever I drive."" She asked to hold it and I gave it to her. She told me that the rock is stupid and before I could say anything back she threw it out the window. I screamed ""What the fuck why did you do that?"". Jane said ""Rocks are stupid and lucky items dont work."" At this point I'm probably 5 minutes away from her house so I pulled over in a grocery store lot and asked her to get out. Jane asked why I was making a big deal about so I told her the meaning behind the rock. And finally I said ""Until you find that rock and give it back to me, never call me for a ride and you're never allowed into my car again."" She ended up getting out of my car and I drove to vicinity of where she threw it at and I spent about 2 hours trying to find it. During those 2 hours friends from our group called me asking what happened and I explained my side. Most of the group knew the significance of the rock because I've given them rides before and they asked about it. Those ones are on my side but the last few are calling me the asshole because I left a woman alone to walk home in the dark. I do feel guilty for kicking her out and I felt like I could've handled the situation better.So reddit AITA for kicking my friend out of my car and banning her from entering my car over a rock?Edit: I will update if I do or don't find the rock.Edit 2: Thank you everyone for the kind words it really means alot. I haven't found it yet but I am getting a group together to help me search for it Friday. A few people have asked for updates so I'll probably give a more detailed one on Saturday or Sunday.Edit 3: for some reason my update got removed but here it is Update: AITA for kicking my friend out of my car and telling her to never call me for a ride?Hello! A lot of people have asked for a update regarding this, I ended up looking for the rock on the day I posted it (Wednesday) and the day after. I couldn't find it on those days either. I called the friends who were on my side and asked if they were free Friday so they could help me look also, the ones who were 'against' me were also willing to come look because my other friends explained to them the importance of the rock and are now fully on my side. Friday comes along and we(there were 7 of us including me) started searching the whole street, we took the advice of some very helpful redditors i.e. throwing another rock out the car to see where it could land, searching farther up or down the street and searching the other side of the street too. One of my friends(rick) ended up finding it about 200 ft. down from where we were searching. I screamed a fuck yeah and basically jumped on him crying, I told him thanks and asked the group if I could buy them all dinner as thanks, they said sure so  we all agreed on pizza and beer. Then we went to Ricks place to eat, as we were talking the topic of Jane came up, someone asked if she's still part of the group. All I said was ""I don't care if she's in the group or not, I'm not gonna not gonna force you guys to stop being her friend, I'll be cordial and make small talk  with her and that's it."" So as of right now Jane is still part of the group because two of them have been friends with her longer than the formation of the group (10+ years?). So the next day I call jane to let her know what happened, she immediately apologizes and doesn't give any excuse as to what happened or why she did it, she does feel guilty and told me she understands if she's out of the group. I just told her what I told the group and also ""Its going to take a long time for me to trust you again and maybe even longer for me to call you a friend."" I ended the call after that and thanked my friends again for looking. So that's really it I found my rock and Jane is still apart of the group but is like 4 arm lengths away from. I'm happy as hell for finding the rock! Thank you everyone for the advice and kind words. It really means a lot that and thank you so fucking much,."
560,Not the A-hole,"Aita for ""setting up"" my ex-husband look like a bad father?",20449,jefbmk,1635,"I'll keep this short. When my and ex's daughter ""Megan"" was turning 13 she wanted a tiered Harry Potter cake (she loves the movies). She was very specific in what she wanted. I told her as gently as I could that I didn't think we'd be able to afford that. And my Ex took that opportunity to be the ""fun parent"" and said in a doting voice ""Oh baby don't worry, Daddy will get you your cake."" She was all smiles and ran off to get her bags.I told him if he was going to promise this to order it early, cuz bakeries require advance order. He got all huffy and said he ""knew what the fuck \[he\] was doing"" and I should mind my business. I said anything involving our daughter IS my business. He said he didn't need my help, and I should just handle the birthday party and he'd get the cake. I said okay then they left for the weekend.I know my Ex. He puts things off that aren't about him. I knew he was going to forget to order. Usually I'd pester him so he wouldn't forget. But he said he didn't need my help so I decided to not bring it up unless he did. But I did call a friend I have who started decorating cakes to order the cake from her. It cost a bit more than I'd have liked but not as much as I'd been worried it would.Well he never brought the cake up again. At least not until the DAY BEFORE HER BIRTHDAY. Where he called me, frantic. **He forgot to order the cake.** And now NONE of the bakeries will take his order without tacking on a MASSIVE fee cuz there's no way they can have the cake ready unless they focus their FULL STAFF on ONE cake. I was going to tell him not to worry, I ordered the cake for him. But then he says ***""Why didn't you remind me?!""*** I just snapped and said he needed to figure this out and he better have a cake tomorrow, then I hung up.He brought a cake... a plain white sheet cake with red trim and one of those print out sugar decals on the front of harry potter and his two friends. And a wax '11' candle.... she was turning 13. He revealed the cake DURING her party so everyone was sitting quiet and Megan looked heartbroken and tried to be nice but she asked what happened to the cake she wanted. Ex floundered and I let him for a few seconds before laughing ""HAHA JUST KIDDING!"" And then I went and pulled the cake I ordered from the kitchen.Megan LIT UP and everyone laughed and it was just one huge joke and the rest of the party went great. But after everyone went home and Megan was in her room Ex tried to lay into me about ""humiliating him"" and ""letting him look like a bad father"" and I told him the only one who made him look bad was HIM.I think I was justified but some mutual friends think I should have just told him I got the cake to keep things civil between us. AITA?**EDIT:** I never told Megan or even planned to tell her (not until she was older maybe) but she started acting very chilly to Ex for a long while after her birthday party and when he asked her why she admitted to almost walking into the kitchen when he and I were whisper arguing the night of her birthday. She found out he'd completely forgotten to order the cake and the ""joke cake"" was actually the REAL cake he got her. So she was very cross with him for a long time afterwards.**EDIT 2:** To everyone thinking I purposefully waited to have him reveal the ""joke cake"" before showing the cake I ordered I didn't. I'd PLANNED on pulling him aside before the party and letting him know I just went ahead and ordered a cake for him. Then we'd take in the big cake and leave whatever he brought in the kitchen. But.... he showed up after all the guests had arrived. So I didn't have time to grab him before he sat the sheet cake box on the dining room table where everyone saw it. And I knew everyone would notice us taking his short pink box into the kitchen and coming back out with a taller white one... I thought on my toes.**EDIT 3:** Sorry but I can't post a cake tax picture because I only got one picture of her cake that day (i'd asked my brother to take pics for me since I was trying to handle everything else but he got distracted, never asking him again...) and the pic has Megan and all her friends around the cake and I'd prefer to not post pics of other people's children (even with them obscured) online. Also my friend doesn't bake anymore. She likes to try new stuff and baking/cake decorating was another thing she got into but lost interest in. But currently she's Very into photography! :)"

562,Not the A-hole,AITA for going behind my mum's back to get a diagnosis?,20437,kowici,1573,"So background to this: I [17M] have a twin sister [17F]. Our parents have always kind of had us compete with each other and are especially sticklers for academics. My sister has always done much better than me on that front. Tbh, I've always found school very frustrating. It's not like I'm thick or anything, I know loads of stuff and often know the answers in class, I've just always struggled with focusing and putting my thoughts together coherently in a way teachers like. I also have a horrible memory, so exams are a nightmare I can study and study and study something for *hours* sometimes and still not remember it when it comes to the test. And that's when I *can* study - sometimes I honestly really really want to but I just can't. Like I'll sit there, staring at my workbook for ages and there's just some block where I can't do it. My parents just kind of ignore all this and tell me to study harder like my sister. I try some of her study methods, and some of them help, but mostly they don't work for me. I always kinda thought I was just doomed to be shit at education. The situation: I started dating a boy about a year ago whose big sister is a psychologist. A few months ago, he and I were talking about school while she was in the room and she kinda said ""sorry to butt in, but have you ever been tested for ADHD?"" I said I hadn't, because I didn't think I had it. The image I had of ADHD was always the rambunctious kid who played class clown, which is very much not me. She explained that wasn't always the case and a lot of the things I was describing sounded like ADHD symptoms. I relayed this to my parents and they both (especially my mum) got upset and said that I'm just looking for a way to not take accountability and that ADHD didn't exist in their day. I got upset, but talked to my BFs sister again, and she pointed me in the right direction to go and talk to people about it without my parents overseeing. Obviously with the Rona, it was difficult but I managed to get the necessary appointments and *finally* had it comfirmed that I have ADHD.Now my parents are mad. They keep on about how I'm just trying to remove responsibility and how they don't recognise the diagnosis as valid. They've also said they don't want me talking to my boyfriend any more, saying his family are a bad influence. We're both upset about it. Was it a bad idea for me to go get the diagnosis when they told me not to?"
563,Not the A-hole,"AITA for sharing pictures of my bathroom after my new neighbor urinated all over my bathroom (my drywall, toilet, and trashcan)? They say they now don't feel welcome in the neighborhood.",20433,hutiqh,1505,"My wife and I wanted to welcome in our two new neighbors that moved in for privacy we will call them Blake and Jeff. We had an outdoor BBQ and had some drinks. Things were going well, we were all having a good time. Jeff and I are both into BMW's so we had a lot in common. Blake ask's if he can use the bathroom and I am like sure. He goes comes back everything's normal, and then 10 minutes later they say they have to leave. I think about an hour later I hear my wife scream, I go check the bathroom and someone URINATED EVERYWHERE, the seat was dirty, the dry wall was dirty, our carpets were wet. I get people miss but this was deliberate, and there was no attempt at all to clean the mess. The only person that went into that bathroom was Blake. Honestly I don't know what happened, but the only time I could imagine that would upset them was when my wife said her brother was a cop and that he was scared of doing his job. But that's it! Like our conversation was 100% PC nothing controversial at ALL. My wife talked to Sally and told them what happened with our neighbor. Sally didn't believe it, so my wife sent Sally the picture and then it got shared by everyone in the neighborhood. Blake and Jeff didn't even deny it, Jeff messaged me that just because we had a conflict doesn't mean I need to go tell the entire neighborhood. They said that as LGBT they face enough discrimination and now don't feel welcome in this neighborhood because we needed to snitch. LIKE WTF. We had no problem with them, we wanted them to feel welcome so we invited them over in the first place. And then they pee all over our bathroom. I don't even get it, Like WTF. We never had any beef or problem with them and they do this. I am just confused. When we tried to respond to their text it shows never delivered so it looks like they might have blocked us? I don't know. I don't see myself as an asshole for sharing with neighbors because how in any world is that okay behavior?"
564,Not the A-hole,AITA because an employee died after I fired her?,20428,j6xcb2,949,"Throwaway account.I manage a retail shop in a tourist city. I hired an applicant named Bruce. He had a fulltime job, but he was perfect for the 16ish hours I was looking to cover.Months later I was looking for seasonal help. Bruce recommended his roommate, a woman with a medical assistant background named Sally. Around the holidays a lot of people step outside their chosen fields to earn more money. Sally's references checked out and I hired her.Sally's training period was uneventful. During that time I learned she had Type 1 Diabetes. We worked out a break schedule so she could eat/test whenever she needed. It wasn't a hardship to accommodate her.Her performance was disappointing. When asking for ID with credit cards she would make comments like ""You gained so much weight since this picture"" ""This says you're blonde, your hair is blue, I can't accept this"" She would argue about tasks saying she's a cashier and isn't paid enough to sweep the floor or tidy up merchandise (the job role specified both tasks). She didn't accept feedback gracefully. I told her her employment was in jeopardyBruce calls me: They are are now married. They sped up the relationship because she needed the health care and he needed her to be on the lease of his apartmen. On my end, all I had to do was have them sign liability waivers and schedule them apart.A few weeks later I get a customer complaining Sally denied him service because she didn't like his tattoos. A 2nd customer calls to complain that not only did Sally deny service because of tattoos but she pulled down her pants to show him a tattoo on her backside. On camera I find Sally mooning the customer. I typed up a termination notice and fired her. She refused to sign it or take a copy. I treated the situation as any other, stuck to ""She is no longer with the company."" if asked.Bruce didn't quit. But he got angry at me not long after: Sally had applied for a hospital job and was denied because I gave a bad reference. NO ONE had called me for a reference. Sally told him I fired her for being ""messy"" and ""combative about breaks"". This is not true, but I can't tell Bruce that. Unless Sally signs a disclosure I can't share any details of her employment/termination with anyone.I called the hospital that denied Sally. The HR department told me that they had an application from her but had not reached out for references as she was not being considered. What I infer from this is: Sally lied to Bruce about why she was fired and then when she the job search went bad she told Bruce I was ruining her prospects.Soon after Bruce calls, He'd been trying to call Sally but she didn't answer. He went home from his other job and found her dead, complications from diabetes.Bruce quits. He says he says she would still be alive if I hadn't fired her or sabotaged her, that I am the reason his wife is dead.I didn't tell him she lied to him. I don't see anyway that would help him with his grief.AITA?"
565,Not the A-hole,AITA for no longer inviting my brother to my house?,20426,je4rm3,1408,"Last weekend I had a small get together for immediate family only (they are in our social bubble) for my sons birthday. My brother brought my nephew (8m) to my house. He has a history of being destructive to people’s homes, and my brother and SIL do not discipline him. According to them he just doesn’t listen so they just give him what he wants. This is not the first time my nephew has destroyed my house, or other relatives for that matter, and I finally had enough. The last time they were over, my son (17m) him mistreating our cat. After they left and saw that he dumped out all of our soap and shampoo in the bathroom on the floor when my daughter (15f) slipped on the tiles. This last visit he drew all over a brand new couch with the markers SIL brought for him to color with. I had asked her to not let him color on the couch, instead he should color at the kitchen table so it could be washed off. When I confronted my SIL about it she told me “it’s just a couch, you can get slip covers.” I told her that wasn’t the point, that once again he has come to my house and destroyed something and I was tired of having to pay to clean/replace the things he destroyed. My brother intervened and said that I was being over dramatic and that he was just a kid. I told my brother that they needed to leave. The next day I called him and told him that they werent welcome back into my house and that they could either pay for someone to come clean the couch or for the cost of a replacement. My brother told me that it was never going to happen. An hour later I get a call from my other sister who congratulated me for sticking to my guns and she plans to do the same. My mom got wind of this and called me and told me that I was being out of line and that nephew doesn’t mean to do this and that it was an accident. That according to SIL you can barely see it and I was just trying to get a free couch. So I sent my mom a picture of the doodles on my couch that nephew made. She now agrees my brother should absolutely pay to clean the couch or replace it but that I am going too far by banning them from my home. I told her I disagreed and that he can always go to her house and destroy her stuff if she wants to see us all together. AITA for not inviting them to my house anymore?"
566,Not the A-hole,AITA from bailing on my promise to sew my future SIL wedding dress?,20427,hvrpjg,1173,"TL: DR: I had agreed to sew on my SIL wedding dress, she changed the model she wanted for something far more complicated and expensive, I bailed out, now my family think I'm heartless.\---------------------------------------------------------------------Update: I am really touched by the support and the many great advices I received.Many of you here or on pm gave me ideas and leads on how to deal with this the best way available, as well as pointing out things I hadn't even considered.  \* On saturday I see my parents. I will explain to them that as much as I appreciate their faith in my capacities, I am not up to the task, and while their support is amazing, at this moment and on that's subject, it's misguided.  \* I will do an itemized list of the costs of the first dress (the one I agreed to make), a quote from a professionnal seamstress of my town for the new dress my SIL want, and a few picked up exemple of the prices of off the rack dresses and show it to them to demonstrate my point  \* Many of you also pointed out that while my SIL is planning on splurging... the question of who is going to shoulder the extra cost hasn't been raised. I want to touch that point with them too.  \* Also raise the point that it's all nice and well to ""faire des plans sur la comète"" ( I think in english it can be translated as wishing upon the moon) for a 2021 wedding, it's not even guaranteed! Yes, having her wedding ruined is hard and shitty and effed up, and to all of you here going through this, I really hope the postponement will only bring you even better things. But, it doesn't allow her to act like this, and I Will not go to that wedding unless big apologies are made.Last but not least. i had no idea there were that much fabric artists, may you all be sewists, embroidresses, stylists, and such. And I had no idea this community would be so supportive and I also learned a lotSo, again, thank you all. I will update next week when I have seen my parents\-------------------------------------------------------------------------My brother and future SIL had planned on getting married by the end of june, but Covid happened.Long before that, he had requested from me, as a wedding gift, to sew the wedding dress of my SIL: I am by no means a professionnal but I can do simple stuff rather nicely. I already sew stuff for my family and friends as gifts regularly, little outfits for the kids or cosplays, easy stuff that can be worn even if there are a few defects on it... They had planned on a no frill wedding with close family and friends only, and my SIL had her eyes on a flowing, layered grecian tunic style dress: rather easy to do and not too expensive as far as materials needed so I agreed.But with the lockdown, well, things got complicated (lockdown started here on march, so we were unable to get the fittings down, eg) and pretty soon they realised the wedding would have to be postponed.My SIL LOST it. Really. Crying and screaming and everything, nothing we could do or say could calm her down, until my brother asked her what she wanted to do instead and she said she wanted now a big wedding as a compensation. I mean, well, ok, I get her frustration, I really do. But the main reason they were having a small wedding was to save on some bucks to renovate the house and such. But that's none of my business, I know.My brother relented and they are now planning a big thing for 2021.SIL sent me her new requirements. She wants a full skirt, silk, bodiced, lined, embroidered, train-ed, the whole princess gig, dress. That, of course, I would still pay for in full for the materials.I told her I didn't feel I could do it. That it was too complicated for my skills. She went ballistic. Said I was lying, that I had done complicated things before, and that it was just "" nothing more than a couple more stitches"".I have been trying to explain to my brother (because she doesn't want to speak to me anymore, as I am conspiring to ruin her wedding) that I do not feel able to do it. His solution is that I buy the wedding dress she wants, or I wouldn't be invited to the wedding.So I said ok. I said I wouldn't go, because I couldn't do what they asked me. I can't sew that dress, and I certainly can not pay for what she wants.I'm now the heartless big sis who doesn't approve of her lil bro wedding/ wife, and honestly I just want to tell them all to go stitch their too big mouths closed!(Sorry if I made mistakes as english isn't my first langage)"

I do really enjoy my job because it provides a relationship with your patients and allows a lot of flexibility and it pays pretty well too I'm 25 and making $78,123 per year I ended up doing midwifery after nursing. My sister has always criticized my nursing career as ""not being manly enough"" and has told me women don't like feminine guys and I'd have trouble finding a wife etc and usually, I just put up with it since I don't want to cause any drama in the house but I reached my boiling point today. For some information on my sister, she has genuinely never worked a day in her life she either mooches off her parents any boyfriends she had at the time but now she mooches off her husband I feel bad for guy ending up with my sister. She made another comment about my career again today and I got angry, I told her she's never worked a day in her life and she's an incompetent mooch and that a stay at home mum isn't a job which I know isn't true but keep In mind I was pissed at this point.

568,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my pregnant and disabled sister that she needs to move out before baby comes?,20410,ftd115,2136,"So I feel terrible and guilty but I also feel like I have no choice. Looking for advice and unbiased judgment.I have a younger sister (26) who’s disabled. I won’t get into it but she’s unable to work a full time job and is on disability, which isn’t much. She’s been living with me for ~3 years. I pay for nearly everything including groceries but she chips in for utilities or takeout once in a while. Last year she started dating a guy and got very serious very quickly. He’s underemployed with social anxiety and lives off of a little money his parents send him each month. He also moved in with us a few months back. I live in a larger house so didn’t mind 2 more people at the time. Two weeks ago my sister told me she was pregnant. I was shocked. She said she’s around 1.5 months along and they’re excited to be parents. I didn’t know how to react and sat on it for a few days before approaching both of them and saying that I can’t have them raising a baby in my home. I basically support both of them at this stage, letting them use their own money (again, not much) for leisure things like movies or video games. I asked them how they plan on paying for a baby and they didn’t think it was a big deal. I imagine if the baby comes I’ll probably end up paying for all 3 of them. In the end I told both of them that they can stay with me until the baby comes, but I don’t want a baby in my home and the huge amount of responsibility that will probably fall to me. My sister cried and her bf accused me of being two faced, because they have nowhere else to go. I offered to help them pay rent for the first few months and budget for them but they’re resistant. My sister is now saying I’m essentially forcing them to give up their baby by kicking them out. I feel bad but I feel like if this keeps going I’ll be supporting an entire family on my own for who knows how long. AITA?"
569,Not the A-hole,AITA for giving my family the silent treatment over their slut bet?,20404,k7bpjd,1598,"I'm a freshman in college and before college I was homeschooled basically my whole life. Because of that I have pretty bad social anxiety.Regardless of that, I was really excited to go to college and finally have freedom (Apart from the COVID safety measures.) My parents really didn't want me to go and threw a huge fit about it since they think I only want to go to sleep around and drink. Every time I spoke to them while I was away they would try to get me to come back home so I stopped answering their calls as often which really pissed my mom off. I went from talking to my parents multiple times a day to around once a week though I would still speak with my siblings.They were literally obsessed with the idea of me leaving their home and becoming a ""whore"" which was odd since they'd never been like that before. They have this idea that I'm a ""good girl gone wild"". They used to let me have co-ed sleepovers and hang out with guys whenever I wanted.Anyways, I was talking to my sister (15) and she told me about this bet that my family had made. I guess in retaliation for me not answering their calls, they were betting if I'd become a slut in college. They were speculating on when I'd lose my virginity, how many guys I'd sleep with, if I'd sleep with a girl, etc.  She sent me a few screenshots and it seemed almost like a big passive aggressive joke.It wasn't just my parents in it It had my siblings, cousins and aunts. While they were seemingly kidding, I felt extremely embarrassed.I didn't know how to bring it up because I didn't want my sister to get in trouble for showing me so it went on for a while.I finally texted my mom about it and asked her if she would please delete the chat or atleast add me to it so it wasn't just my family talking and clowning me behind my back. I didn't mention that it was my sister who had shown me it. My mother insisted that they weren't talking about me and that I was being a primadonna even though I literally have evidence.Since it was obvious that they weren't going to delete it, I told my mom that I wasn't going to come home for Christmas and I wasn't going to come visit her after her surgery (She's having surgery soon and asked me to come). Partially out of anger and because of embarrassment.Christmas is my mom's favorite holiday and she always goes all out for it. She wanted me to be her caretaker after the surgery since after Christmas ""her money will be tight"" and she didn't want to pay for one. She says that I'm abandoning her and I think that she stabbed me in the back.TLDR: Family made a bet about how much of a slut I'd become in college so now I'm not going home for Christmas and I'm not taking care of my mother.AITA?"
570,Not the A-hole,WIBTA If I don't share my rather large (to me at least) inheritance with my aunt and 3 cousins?,20406,auzirj,3814,"Some background: My grandfather just passed away at the end of January. He was closing in on 90 and lived a very full life and died very peacefully in his home which is exactly where he wanted to be. This is where the story gets very sticky, my grandfather lived in a cheap tract house and was very frugal. His only passions in life were woodworking and his garden. But to my huge surprised I was named as his sole heir with life changing money. With the house, everything in it and cash his estate was valued at a little over a million dollars. Here's where it gets even stickier. My mom passed away 6 years ago. She had one sister who I was fairly close to and from her I have 3 cousins. I don't know the full details of why my aunt was estranged from my grandpa, in fact all my mom ever told me was ""it's between the two of them."" I have mixed relationship with my cousins and because their mom was estranged from my grandpa, they never had a nice word to say about him and I don't know if they ever met him. To be fair, they probably never had the chance to get to know him like I did. Cousins and aunt did not attend the very small funeral I set up for my grandpa either. Now she and my cousins have been basically calling me nonstop somewhere between begging me and demanding of me that I split the estate 5 ways. This is what both of my attorneys have essentially advised:No matter what I shouldn't split the estate 5 ways. If I do decide to be incredibly generous, it should be split 50/50 and my aunt and cousins can divide their half however they like. Both attorneys have advised against this period, as it's not in my best interest. I can write 4 $5000 checks out of the estate to get them to go away. $5000 in our state's probate system is generally seen as ""enough"" of an inheritance to be essentially be uncontestable and my aunt and cousins will have no further claim on my grandpas estate, or none that a judge would be willing to hear. The first attorney strongly advised I do this. I do nothing. I am carrying out my grandpa's wishes to the letter and that is my responsibility and also my benefit for staying close to him in his lifetime. This is my second attorney's preferred course of action. But this is not about the legality of the situation. This is about what SHOULD I do and would I be the asshole if I keep the entire estate for myself. Just over a million dollars is enough money for me to finally fund a retirement account, have a down payment on a decent house and actually save some money. I have no designs on a big blow out but maybe updating my car would be nice. I could do all of that with $500k, but that number sure looks different that $1 million. Basically, WIBTA if I don't share this inheritance like my aunt and cousins are asking of me?"
571,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not letting my wife have mothers day after she ""canceled"" fathers day?",20399,bkrxqk,2191,"So, this is a little strange of a situation but hear me out.I've been married to my wife for almost 7 years now and we have 2 children, one 6 and the other 4. I love her but she is a bit strange sometimes. She is very heavy anti-corporation/government (you know the type.  I will give her credit and say she's very moderate with these views though and not crazy). One of her big beliefs though is with holidays. She still celebrates holidays with the family (Christmas, Easter, etc) but likes to keep them minimalist and not embrace the ""Money"" side of things. We're not monsters though, we still buy our kids stuff for Christmas and for their birthdays but we've tried to make them know this is now what these days should be about and that generosity, not materials, should be what we thing about.Last year in June my wife told me she doesn't want to celebrate fathers day. Her reasoning was simple, she wanted our children to respect us everyday and not make one day a special occasion for celebrating fathers or mothers. I was a little hesitant but I agreed and we took the day to try to teach them that.Well, now that mothers day is coming around she's changing her tune. All of the sudden she wants me and the kids to take her out for breakfast, buy her gifts, and do other things for her. I obviously told her no, that we didn't celebrate fathers day and this was her idea to begin with. All of the sudden she got super upset and is claiming i'm the asshole here. She's now saying we should celebrate both days and that it's unfair to her that we aren't celebrating mothers day. We fought about this last night and she's still mad about it.Am i being unfair here?"
572,Not the A-hole,AITA for making my nephew a dinosaur quilt? My sister is deeply Christian,20394,i9vw78,2749,"My sister and I weren't raised religious. She went off to uni at 18 and became a Christian when she started dating another Christian. Basically the point is she doesn't believe anymore that dinosaurs exist. She's now married to a man who isn't religious which is a sore point for her that he won't convert. I have a niece (9) and a nephew (6). A couple of weeks ago while watching them, my nephew mentioned his quilt I made him was getting too short so I told them both to go into my craft room and pick some fabrics they each want on a quilt. I could easily open a fabric shop with all the fabric I have so they had a rare time picking out their fabrics. My niece went for some space/galaxy themed and my nephew picked out some dinosaur fabrics. I thought nothing of it and got to work.Today I went over with their quilts, excited to see their reaction. They were so happy until my sister noticed my nephew's quilt and asked 'what the fuck?!'. I was confused and she quickly went on a rant about her knowing dinosaurs don't exist and how dare I try brainwash her child like that. I told her he picked out the fabric himself, I genuinely didn't make the connection and I would let him pick more fabric for a different quilt. By this point my nephew is crying saying he doesn't want a different quilt so my sister called my BIL in telling him to set me straight. He basically shrugged and asked what the big deal was, it's only fabric, their son likes the fabric, it's his son too and he believes in dinosaurs so he should get a say on the quilt too if it's such a big deal.My parents are now involved and despite not being religious, they are pissed at me for what I've done.  No one but my BIL believes it was a genuine mistake or oversight and they think I've set out to mock my sister's beliefs. I honestly didn't think I'd have to vet my nephew's fabric choices with my sister as all the fabric they had access to was kid friendly prints. The stuff with swearing etc is kept elsewhere as they like going into my craft roomEditThank you good people of Reddit for your comments and advice. If there's anymore comments tomorrow I'll try reply to them! I'm off to sleep now and here's hoping I don't dream of dinosaurs ) night night!"
573,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling someone to fuck off?,20392,k24gun,951,"At my fiancées work there is an attractive guy. My fiancée and her friend were talking about him and apparently the friend tried to convince my fiancée to cheat. She refused and told me. I visited her at work recently and this friend began telling me that we should have an open relationship and I’m holding my fiancée back. I mostly laughed it off at first and told her I wasn’t comfortable with that kind of relationship. She kept pushing so I told her, “ Can you fuck off? I barely even know your name lady. Your opinion does not matter to me.” She got mad and called me an asshole. My fiancée was mad I treated her friend that way because, “she was joking.” Am I the asshole for getting mad?Edit: one common question is why doesn’t the friend get with him. She did, from what I have been told she is a very promiscuous girl. Also I know my fiancée has issues with people pleasing and abandonment, she’s in therapy. I’m going to bring up a lot of this to her tomorrow and tell her that I am not comfortable with her friendEdit: I just wanna say that my fiancée is not cheating on me. I trust her more than anyone, I will take some of this advice and deal with it from there. Maybe she was curious about open relationships but that’s a different discussion"
574,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my husband and his family to suck it up when they complained about my daughters wedding?,20377,lbu51k,1040,"I won't complicate this. I have a daughter Cara who is not my biological daughter, nor was she my legal daughter until she reached the age of 18 when she asked me to adopt her as an adult. I married my husband when she was 14 and together we have two children. Cara gets along okay with my husband. But admittedly her upbringing means she was maybe not as able to bond with a father figure as she was with a mother figure and her age was also a factor. Regardless, everyone gets along and I think that is the best you expect when you have someone who went through as much as she did at a young age.Cara is engaged and came to me recently and told me she would like to walk with me down the aisle and do a dance with me while her fiance dances with his mom.  She told me she didn't know how to ask for that without hurting my husband. I told her he would understand and I would be honored to do it.I did not expect my husband and his parents to take offence. They believe she snubbed my husband and is making it seem like he's nothing. After listening to them complain about this for ten minutes I told them to suck it up and accept that she asked me, her mom, to do both of those parts of the wedding and that I was proud to do it. I dared them to tell me I was less deserving than my husband.My husband and his parents believe I wasn't very understanding (and downright rude!!! according to my MIL).AITA?So to clarify for people because I was not clear. My husband is not her father, he is her stepfather through me. I was married before and she was my stepdaughter who I ended up with custody of but never legally adopted as a minor because her biological mother was alive. She has trauma relating to father figures (two prior ones to be exact) so she has never really considered my husband as such but their relationship has been good considering everything she has been through.I did adopt her when she turned 18. Not my husband, just me.Adding some more to this. Had my husband confided in me that his feelings were hurt that would be one thing. But he did not. He went to his parents and then all three decided to take offence to the fact not only was he not asked but I was. And while they never came out directly and told me that I should say no it was implied throughout their complaints. None of which were about his hurt feelings and all about the ""snub"" and how unbelievable it was that I would be filling that role in her wedding."
575,Not the A-hole,AITA for disallowing my son from being alone with his girlfriend?,20350,ihwkr2,1094,"My son is 16. His girlfriend is too. They’ve been dating for about a year. When they started dating it was normal and appropriate. Then, over the last several months, I’ve noticed strange behavior, especially around her. He’s usually really talkative and emotive and energetic but he‘s kind of withdrawn whenever she’s around. She’d answer questions for him and finish his sentences, too. I didn’t think much of it at at first. But then I realized he wasn’t spending time with his core group of friends anymore. Turns out it was because his girlfriend said he wasn’t “allowed” to see them without her.He wasn’t going out and doing things he used to enjoy. I asked him about it and he said his girlfriend didn’t think they were “cool” things to be doing (she sold his skateboard, she threw out all his drawings.) We had a talk about not changing yourself to please others and I thought she was a bitch but it was all normal teenage coming of age stuff. Recently, I was on the road for work, and he had on a date with this girl so I texted to ask how it went. He didn’t reply. I followed up to be sure he made it home, he called and said he couldn’t reply over text because *she reads all his messages* and asked me to not ever text him about her. I told him that was a red flag, but he said that when things are good with her they’re really good so he’s fine to put up with her when things are bad. I’m a single mom, so I thought maybe I was being too overprotective of the whole situation, and I just needed to stop interfering. But on that same trip I called again to ask how a visit to his aunt had gone and he said he didn’t go because his girlfriend feels like he spends too much time with his family lately. I advised him that wasn’t her decision to make and if he felt like he spent too much with family, that was one thing, but he needed to learn to tell her “no” and if she couldn’t handle it she didn’t deserve him. He said he couldn’t do that because he was afraid of what she would say and she’s unpredictable when she gets “in a state.”I was still at crossroads because I know he’s at an age where he needs to problem solve for himself. But a male coworker couldn’t help overhearing us talk and he said, “Just consider, if you had a daughter instead, would you be letting a boyfriend treat her like that?” I hadn’t thought of it like that. So when talking didn’t work, I eventually banned them from being alone together and took her off his social media so she can no longer monitor it. A lot of men who I trust to give me “single mom parenting advice” are saying this was an asshole move, because my son is not in any danger and needs to learn not to let girls push him around just to get his rocks off. But the parenting instinct in me said this was a double standard placing him at risk. But maybe they’re right and it’s actually just be overprotectiveness, in which case I’m the one who’s making things worse. I’m at a loss. AITA?Edit Thank you so much for all these replies. I’ve been too overwhelmed too answer everyone individually but I’m so touched and really really appreciate all of you!"
576,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling my brother a piss baby?,20321,gw2p4i,1408,"My brother (27m) lives with my parents and I (16m). My brother is a nice guy/incel. He’s constantly ranting about how girls won’t go out with him, and how apparently they’re all dirty whores for not liking him. My parents seem to only encourage his behavior. What’s worse is he’s a gym teacher, so his female students (some of whom are my classmates) are exposed to his nasty ass attitude. Last night, my brother went on another long rant about the latest girl who managed to resist his ‘nice guy charm.’ He kept going on about it, and I got annoyed because of it. I told him, ‘Maybe if you weren’t such a piss baby someone would want to date you.’ (Piss baby was said because my parents have forbidden the term incel in our house. Because my brother gets upset over it. Also, it was the first thing I could come up with other than incel)Surprise, my brother gets upset about it. My dad tells me to apologize to my brother, and I tell him I wasn’t going to apologize to a nasty ass piss baby who goes around treating people (mainly women) like shit just because he’s a ‘nice guy.’ Things escalate to where my dad, brother and I are all screaming at each other at the dinner table. It ends with me being told to find a friend to stay with for the night, because my parents (and brother) are sooo disappointed in me. I got a long voice mail telling me how disappointing I was. I got told I went too far, and should regret my actions. I don’t regret my actions, and I don’t think I went too far, but whatever.AITA for calling my brother a piss baby?"
577,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling a coworker I was going to ""make a baby"" and name it a name she wants?",20325,dwgbbx,1908,"This is the dumbest argument I've ever been involved in, and definitely the most absurd work conversation, too.I have a friend, ""Julie"", who has just come back from maternity leave. She and I work on neighbouring desks, and the setup is that the longest part of our desks are against each other in a way that leaves us effectively sitting on opposite sides of one large desk. We were on lunch break, eating at our desks, and Julie asks me about when my husband and I are planning on having kids.I reply ""it's in the works, hopefully within the next year. Definitely sooner rather than later""Then another coworker, who sits on the next set of desks over, hears us talking. Her name is ""Anna"" and I'll admit that Julie and I don't really like her, and try and avoid conversations with her in general.Anna interrupts us and says ""Hubby and I are working on having a baby right now.""Julie says ""that's lovely.""Anna then says something about hardly being able to wait for baby ""Joseph"".I say ""that's a lovely name, my father is called Joseph.""Anna then says in a light tone, but there's clearly some venom to it, ""don't you go stealing my name now"" and laughs.I'm a bit taken aback by this, tbh. I'm not offended but it's just a bit like '... ohhhkay, never mentioned it but... sure', and it's really confusing to me because I know about a dozen Josephs, it's not exactly a unique name or something anyone could ""steal"".Julie tries to change the subject, but there's 2 more occasions during the rest of the work day where Anna just sort of says something to me about not ""stealing her name"", both times in the same jokey but menacing tone. At this stage she's getting on my nerves.And then Anna says right as we're leaving ""promise me you'll wait until after me so I get Joseph"", and as she says it she laughs like it's a really funny joke. Julie and I give each other a look that says we really do not get this joke and I realise that she's said I should wait until after she gets pregnant for me to get pregnant in case I ""steal"" the name Joseph.We all head off, the three of us end up in the lift together, and Julie asks about my plans for tonight. I say, totally deadpan, ""going to make a baby. The name Joseph is so rare I'm worried someone is going to steal it if I'm not quick enough"" and Julie and I both burst out laughing.Anna is really really offended. Cannot stress enough how livid she was after hearing me say that. Julie and I both think it's really funny but I told my sister and she says that while it was funny, I was kind of a bitch about the whole thing. I am now doubting how funny it actually was.Am I TA?Backstory because people are asking: Anna was fine when she first started working here a couple years ago, but she was a little too ""by the book"" and got a bit email-happy with HR early on, and would send emails roughly weekly, CCing in whoever it was about, reporting Coworker X for saying she was going to vote on her way home (not allowed to talk about politics) and Coworker Y saying he was going to his niece's confirmation (not allowed to talk about religion) and stuff like that. We all just collectively stopped talking to her so she no longer had ammo for HR. She eased up around the 3 or 4 month mark when she realised it was making her pretty unpopular, but people were still cautious around her. Me, Julie, Anna and a couple other guys who work in different parts of the office are the only people still here who were here for that, and we're still cautious around her even though she hasn't emailed HR in a while. Anna has previously tried to befriend us and she's apologised for her actions in the past, but we still aren't her biggest fans. Anna's desk has the same set up as ours but she doesn't have a desk-mate because hers retired a few months ago and they haven't replaced her yet, and since then Anna has been trying to talk to us over lunch or while we're working. We've tried to keep it professional, asking if she has a certain form or if she got my (work related) email, or stuff like that, but she wants to talk about outside of work and generally get to know us. We're cautious about this because of what happened when she started working here.Also I know I could have said ""I'm not naming my child Joseph"" and been done with it but first off I'm not going to promise not to use it for the sake of a coworker I don't get on with and also it is in the running, as a middle name, along with a few other options, in the 50% possibility that I get pregnant with a boy."

Well the train came on time and everything went Ok and I got into his car. I greeted him but he didn’t greet me back and just slurred out that I was another man’s mistake. I told him that I would tell mom about this but he begged me not to but I still did because it was jut way too much.

581,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling my wife lazy and a terrible mother?,20274,jvx2b5,1922,"This is my first time posting so excuse me for any mistakes I make. I’m a 57 year old male, and my wife is 51 year old female, we’ve been married for 28 years and have one son together that is 25. She’s a stay at home wife, she never worked a day after we got married since I inherited a company that had been in my family for many generations so money was never a problem and we lived more than comfortably. When our son was little she took care of him and the house. Now that he’s an adult the chores are the only thing that she does, she used to take on writing but gave up because she said that it’s not as easy as she thought. Now I don’t consider myself sexist or that woman belongs in the house with kids, this was her choice because she never liked to work. The problem is I work long hours and expect to at least have a dinner after the long day.We have a housekeeper that comes over twice a week so her responsibilities are basically cooking and smaller chores. She stopped cooking and doing things lately because she doesn’t feel like doing it. She spends her days hanging with her friends and shopping. Also our son was born as a female and my wife always wanted a daughter, when he came out as trans she threw a fit and was unsupportive, I paid for his  surgery and he transitioned, she was never as caring towards him as before and uses wring pronounces and his old name all the time.The other day I came home and she didn’t do anything whole day and I snapped, I told her that I’m sick of her not doing anything while I’m providing for our family ( My son is also still in college, and I pay for all of his expenses and apartment because I want him to focus on school). The argument went on and she decided to throw in my face how it’s my fault she lost her daughter. This really socked me and I told her that she is lazy and also a terrible mother for talking as if her child is dead when we have a perfect and healthy son.I am at lost, half of family members are siding with her half with me ( including our son), she called me an asshole and went to stay with her sister. Was I the asshole? I’m seriously considering divorce.Edit: thank you for everyone commenting I just wanted to clear up that my son has been out since he was 14 and had his surgery 5 years ago.Another edit: few of you questioned my son siding with his mom, I don’t know how you got that but my son is definitely on my side (even tho he doesn’t know the full story)."

He told us at dinner that he needs our signatures to drop out of school. We know that he has been struggling since remote learning started last year. We have worked closely with his school to develop an IEP and he goes to therapy three times per week. His school has implemented everything that his therapist recommended including reduced assignments, more time on tests and frequent breaks during lectures. I have even cut my hours down to part-time at work so that I can be home to help him when needed.He told us that if we won't sign the paperwork that as soon as he turns 18 in May, he will sign the forms himself and drop out. My husband asked what plans he had if he were to drop out such as work, living situation and transportation and he said he was going to stay here so he wouldn't have to worry about any of that. We both told him that if he dropped out of school that he would not be leaving here, that he would have six months in which he would need to find a job, a place to live and his own transportation to get back and forth from work. We told him that if he is going to make the adult decision to discontinue his education that he would need to be able to support himself, because we would not be doing that. My husband (a mason) knows several people who are looking for apprentices in HVAC and as an electrician but our son says he doesn't want to do that kind of work. He says he wants to make his living as an influencer because he can't work for other people.We told our son that our decision stands, that at this time he has three choices graduate and get a job/go to college, graduate and work a trade or leave.Our son called us both ""stupid assholes"" and told us ""we don't understand that he doesn't want to work like dad.""AITA for telling our son that if he drops out of school he has six months to move out?"
583,Not the A-hole,AITA for not breastfeeding my baby because she bites?,20261,gj5w26,735,"My daughter, 10 months old has recently started biting during breastfeeding. When she starts to bite, I simply tell her ""no"" and put her down immediately. I only started doing this recently because my breasts kind of look like a war zone- I'm bleeding and sore because of the biting and simply cannot take it anymore. Instead I've been pumping, but even that is extremely painful until I let my breasts heal. Instead I've been doing a mix of pumping and formula. My husband does not like this. He was okay with me pumping and feeding our daughter until I started supplementing with formula. He believes that breastmilk is best and formula is the devil because it's not ""natural"" or something. At this age, I'm giving her milk around 4-5 times a day, and still attempt to breastfeed once or twice a day. It reached the tipping point yesterday when he hid the formula so I'd have ""no choice"" but to breastfeed our daughter. I ask him why he's doing this, and he simply says he doesn't think I'm not trying hard enough because I stopped simply because she's biting me, and that a good mother wouldn't stop doing what's best for her child simply because she's in pain."
584,Not the A-hole,AITA for not being nice to the people trying to force me to sell my home?,20264,l0ghlm,1353,"A large company is trying to buy up all the houses in my area to luxury resort with a golf field, pool, and other things. A few days ago I got a knock on my door and someone came over and she told me she was offering to buy my home, willing to give me 5% over ""market value"" (their bullshit market value is less than I bought it for). I politely said ""No I'm sorry but I am not at all interested in selling my house, have a good day"". She kept trying to sell the house and I told her have a good day. 3 days later she came back with a new offer, now 7.5% over market value. I said the same thing, please go away I am not interested. Next day someone else called me, I just hung up on them. All of my neighbors have been getting the same thing, some are deciding to sell, but most are refusing. That same lady comes over, I was outside doing yard maiteance and says ""hello, good news we have a better offer for you, 12% over market value, that's great isn't it? surely we can work something out."" I then asked ""do you have kids? a pet?"" she then responded back and said ""I have a son and 2 cats, why?"" I then said ""how much for your son? I'll give you 15k for him, and 2k for both your cats"" She confused said ""um those aren't for sale"" so I responded back ""ok asshole, neither is my house, I hope you understand now, get the fuck off my property and never come back, you're not welcome here or anywhere in this neighborhood."" She said ""listen I tried being nice to you, your house will be sold, and we will try other legal means to get your house"" me ""did you not understand what I said, get the fuck off my property you ugly disgusting bitch"" she left. I'm scared that this company is going try to use ""dominio eminente"" to force me to sell my house."
585,Not the A-hole,"AITA for bluntly telling the people I work with that no, not “everyone in the office” can afford to buy a house?",20248,lymr25,1417,"My coworkers are usually pretty good to work with. The average salary for them is around 100k+. I’m their administrative assistant and I make about $32k. Anyway some of the things they say are kind of weird.For example this one woman was shocked that I’d never had any of my clothes tailored before. I think they just really caught up in their own reality you know? Like in their world everyone is beautiful and skinny and rich with purebred dogs and perfect white teeth.I was helping organize and someone announced they finally bought their first house. The conversation continued on to them kind of being rude and saying like “I don’t get why people think no one can afford to buy a house, it’s not hard?” and someone was like “Yeah I can’t imagine being in my 30s and still renting, I’d feel like such a failure” and they all agreed.I don’t usually get upset about the shit they’re talking about but I finally had it and was like “I’m 38 and rent, I don’t think I’m a failure”One of them was like “Oh well we weren’t talking about you, it’s just that all these people always go on and on about how it’s impossible to save for a down payment.”I was just like “Yeah, it is pretty hard.”It was obvious the whole atmosphere in the room changed so I was like “Anyway” and got up and left to the main office to get back to work. Later on one of the other women in the office came up and was like “Hey I’m sorry about earlier I didn’t mean to offend you. It got kind of awkward in there.”I said yeah, it was pretty awkward listening to them talk about how they’d feel like a failure if they were in my shoes. She said that’s not what she meant, she actually meant that it felt like I was trying to call attention to the wage gap like it was their fault, and that if I wanted to better myself they could help me figure out how to apply to schools and work my way up just like they did.I said a kind of half-hearted “thanks.” It’s been weird in the office since then. I know money is one of those no-no topics but it’s not like it’s a secret that I only make what I make. AITA?**forgot to add** we don't have HR and this really isn't an HR thing"

That's when I found out he can't swim, and he was serious. I drag him to shore and he asks if he can just lay on the board and I can just bring him over so he can wait for a wave. I was pissed that im wasting my time on this when I had a class to teach ""listen dumbass, you need to know how to swim to go surfing, just like you need to know how to swim for waterpolo, scuba diving, and many other activities, if you really can't swim then go away im done wasting time here"" he leaves and there was a massive argument that I can hear from the beach where he's yelling at our staff demanding a refund and other shit.

I was in public today when a small girl (maybe 5?) asked me what happened to my leg. I whispered “I’m secretly a robot, shhh, don’t tell anyone.” Her eyes went real wide and she whispered back “okay” and scurried back to her mom. I always get a kick out of little kids reactions. But then the lady standing behind me told me that I shouldn’t lie to children like that and instead teach them “acceptance and body positivity.”I told her it’s great to teach children that, but I just like to get a laugh when I can.I only do this sometimes when kids ask, it’s really funny to see their reactions.AITA?"
588,Not the A-hole,AITA not helping my assigned roommate with his child? And responding with a mean comment,20213,ieule7,1512,"I (30F) moved into a two bedroom place with the understanding that the landlord would be assigning another roommate at some point. I didn't really like this much but I didn't have a choice since housing is so hard to find where I am, especially when you're trans.One morning a week ago I was woken up by the roommate (20s M) moving in. I would have liked some notice but whatever. What was really a problem was that he had a small kid. I really didn't like this but had no choice to accept it. I have a really big room with a bathroom so I could deal with just isolating myself away from the rest of the house.The problems started immediately. Roommate let his kid use my microwave and he just exploded a mysterious substance all over it. I was horrified and demanded the roommate clean it up but he said he was ""too tired from parenting"". So I cleaned it up and put it in my room as well as all my other appliances. My room has the space and while it's not ideal I could fit my fridge, microwave, toaster, etc all in there with a bit of creative setting up.He really didn't like this though and demanded I put the stuff back out in the kitchen. I refused and told him to get his own appliances for the kid to destroy. He said he couldn't afford to. I said not my problem and went back into my room and locked it.Today I was woken up to him knocking loudly on my door. I was kind of fucking terrified by this strange aggressive man behaving like that so I texted him asking what he wanted. He said he needed me to watch his demon for the day because of a family emergency. I said no because I had plans (scheduled event in an MMO so I couldn't cancel without letting a lot of people down). He kept insisting so I just turned my phone off and ignored him.I don't know how that situation resolved itself but shortly after I got a call from the landlord asking if I could help with the kid more because the tenant is trying to break the lease over it. I said no I'm not a live in babysitter. He agreed in the end and said that he wouldn't make the mistake of letting a kid live in the house again. I thanked him and we ended the call. Just now I needed to grab something of mine from the living room and roommate was there looking distraught. I tried to ignore him but he just yelled at me ""what kind of so-called woman are you"". That really pissed me off so I said what kind of so-called man needs a live in mommy to wrangle his kid and went back to my room. I felt a little bit bad about that comment but I felt that his transphobic comment was really uncalled for so I snapped. AITA?"
589,Not the A-hole,Aita for telling my daughter that she can't have kids while she still lives in my house,20182,eaq61q,2220,"I know it sounds bad but here's the story. I  (62f)  live with my husband (65m) who I my kids stepfather. I had 3 kids with my first husband who passed away a few years ago, they are all relatively successful. 2 of them have moved out but one still lives with me, which I don't mind, but I think it's time that they be on their own as the others are.Oldest kid: 30 Male. Moved out years ago, lives with his wife and the recently had their first baby.Middle Kid: 27 Female. Married for 2 years, her and her husband live with me while they save up for a place.Youngest: 22 Female. Lives in a college dorm in another city. Ever since my son and Dil had their baby, my oldest daughter has been baby crazy and has been constantly talking about how she can't wait to be a mom. I love my daughter but I don't want a baby in the house. I stopped at 3 for a reason.  I don't want her to live here forever, I want her and her husband to have their own lives, while my husband and I to have our own lives by ourselves. A couple nights ago at dinner I sat her down and told her my reasoning and told her that if she wants a baby that badly then her and her husband need to start looking for their own place. She didn't take it too well and called me selfish and that I only think about myself. Which right now is true, for 30 years i've put my kids first and now I want to put myself first. I hardly think I'm selfish for that.I tried to explain my reasoning and her husband said he understood but I know he was angry too. My husband is on my side and says I'm nta. For the past week my daughter and son in law have been ignoring me an only talks to me when its necessary. I told some friends about what happened and most understand where I'm coming from but a couple said that I am TA as it wouldn't matter because its not my baby so I wouldn't have any responsibility towards it. I don't know what to do, I don't want my daughter to hate me but I'm getting older and I would like for my kids to be independent while my husband and I can enjoy retirement together. AITA?"
590,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my brother's entire family to move out because my nephew set my bathroom on fire for a tiktok?,20183,l0xiqa,3081,"My (32F) brother (43M), his wife (40?F), and their two kids (9F and 15M) have been staying with me for a little over two weeks now because they lost their jobs due to coronavirus and were evicted. Four people is obviously a large addition, but I didn't want them to be homeless and they assured me it'd be a temporary stay. Two days ago, my nephew set my bathroom on fire for a tiktok. From what he told me after, there's some kind of trend where you draw a shape on your mirror with hairspray and then you light it on fire, and it's supposed to go out on it's own without any damage. Well, his fire spread onto a nearby stack of towels and got out of control. We all had to evacuate, but luckily I live relatively close to a firestation so the damage wasn't that bad. My guest bathroom is scorched and will need repairs, but the rest of my home is okay. I think that my brother and SIL had to have been wildly negligible to allow this to happen, especially considering the lighter he used was my brother's, meaning he must have taken it from him at some point. I'm asking them to leave within the next week because I don't want to risk something of this nature happening again. They've apologized and asked me to reconsider because it was an accident, no one was hurt in the end, they'd be homeless if I kicked them out now, and to think of my niece who did nothing. I'm not going to charge them for the repairs because they flat out can't afford it, but I no longer feel safe living with them."

No, I don't have any debt also I want to have the house for personal usage as I currently live in a cozy apartment by myself however, I'm afraid that if anybody found out they would try to use me or get me for my money.

592,Not the A-hole,AITA for giving a company my honest opinion on their interview process when they asked for it?,20157,hi6t5z,1210,"I applied for a job a few months ago, it was a completely online work from home job regardless of the current situation so all communication and process was done online. This was for a retail consultant position for the online shoppers. They could seek advice from the consultant if they needed help choosing products. I received an email saying they would like to interview me. Sweet. I got an email link for a zoom call the next week. I had no idea how many people would be on this call or who I would be talking to. I join the call and there are like 30 of us on there. The hiring rep tells us all to mute ourselves as we will be listening and not talking. We proceeded to sit through a 2 hour presentation on the company history, their finances, goals, and every little gritty detail that nobody actually cares about. At the end of the presentation they told us that they had been watching our faces to see how our engagement was during the presentation to determine who would move onto the next interview step. They said they would select 5 people out of the 30 on the call. After the call they wanted us to write a 3 page essay about a particular topic from a list they provided us. We had 2 hours to turn it in. Well I did not get selected and received that email the next day. Along with that email was an attached form they wanted reviewing the interview process with a blank box at the end to “give them our honest opinion on the interview process”. I told them honestly that I found it a bit inappropriate and not very well organized that I had to dedicate 5 hours of my time to an interview for a position they weren’t even considering me for. I explained that had I been in the final pool of candidates it would have been fine but having me watch a 2 hour presentation on the company and write a 3 page essay just so I can be weeded out in the first step was just not the business. I received a nasty email back from the hiring recruiter saying that they’re glad they didn’t hire me with that kind of an attitude and just a bunch of other rude stuff. I didn’t reply. My bf and mom think that I was out of line and that if I really wanted the job I wouldn’t have an issue with doing all of that work. Again I wouldn’t if I was actually being considered for employment but I just found it weird that I had to go through all that as a preliminary screen. AITA?EDIT: a lot of people are telling me this is an MLM/pyramid scheme. It looks like it, but it definitely wasn’t. I found the job on indeed, they are a company similar to Ulta/Sephora who sell their own products as well as other brands. The job was basically to be like an online Sephora employee where people could request help matching foundation shades, asking skincare questions etc.EDIT 2: thank you kind stranger for the award! And thank you all for the well wishes on finding a new job. I did find one that pays me well and had a very reasonable hiring process!"
593,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing my mother's dying wish,20154,fxsho6,2333,"33F, married, financially stable and happy with a couple cats and a senior dogMy mother (67 F) is a cancer survivor and was recently diagnosed with another, more aggressive form of tumor. Considering her history with treatment, the prognosis isn't good. She and I aren't close. She has untreated mental health issues (I suspect BPD) that made my life hell growing up, and even in my adult years she's often tried to control my life to make it more like hers. One thing we've always disagreed on is the topic of babies. My mother *loves* babies (but not children, who have opinions) and has desperately wanted to be a grandmother from the moment she found out she was having a daughter. Unfortunately for her, I'm childfree. I like kids. I even work with babies, and I'm good with them. But I've never wanted one, and I'm an only child.I called her after the diagnosis came in to check on her, and - in tears - she declared that now is the time that I *have* to give her a grandbaby. The doctor is giving her about a year to live, perfect timing if I get pregnant now apparently. She says this is the only thing that would make her feel better about dying.As usual, I said no. I don't want a kid. My spouse doesn't want a kid. That's it.Now, several of my mother's friends, who in the past had supported my decision, are calling me up to say I'm TA for refusing her dying wish. They're pointing out that my spouse and I could afford a child (true) and that we already have more space in our home than we need (sort of true), and therefore the only thing that's stopping me from popping out an infant in 9 months is, in their opinion, that I'm a horrible selfish child.To be clear, I'm not going to change my mind. A lot of factors have gone into my decision not to have babies, and a few old people calling me a self-absorbed bitch won't change that, but I'll admit that perhaps I am, in fact, a self-absorbed bitch. What say you, reddit?"
594,Not the A-hole,"AITA for using my BFs last name, even though we're not yet married?",20136,jstemd,1937,"I've created a throwaway because I usually lurk here but don't have a main Reddit account. This is not a big dramatic situation, but I'm curious about what people will think since this has really divided people in my life.I (30F) work as a copywriter in a fairly competitive field. I write in English even though I'm not an English native, but I have been working in this field and in English for over 6 years. Now, a couple of years ago I was looking for a new job and having difficulty getting interviews. After some time, I realized it may have been because my last name is very typical of my country (think Martinez or similar) and people were screening me assuming my English level. To A/B test this theory, I asked my boyfriend, who is white and English-native, if I could use his last name to apply for jobs. I didn't see it as a big deal as we're planning on getting married and me taking his last name anyway. To be clear: other than the name on the CV, I made no claims to be an actual English native, just native-level, and I'm always honest about my background in interviews. Well, guess what? It worked. I got my current job based on that CV, and now use his last name on LinkedIn and all professional channels. Recently, I shared this story with a (white, English-native) friend of mine and they were extremely offended. Firstly they accused me of denying my culture, birth country, and trying to be white. Then they said I was lying to companies and misrepresenting myself, and that I could be stealing this job from more deserving people. He even implied that he would go to my current company and ""reveal my secret"" which is ridiculous as I've provided my ID to them, so they know that this is not my ""official"" name??I was taken aback at how seriously angry he got at this, and I wanted to know... Am I the asshole for using my bf's last name professionally?"

I grew up as a fat kid however when I started college and moved to a very fitness friendly state (CO) I lost alot of weight. I started to care more about my looks. I became a personal trainer last year and got a rhinoplasty recently to fix my crooked humped nose. My sister decided to move up with me. My sister was not very approving of my weight loss nor was she happy I did alot to change my appereance. While we get along wonderfully most of the time we still have fights about her thinking I'm vain. My sisters weight is around 300lb, I have offered her help however she just tells me life isnt about looks. Frankly I dont care what she looks like I just want her to be healthy and confident.My sister sometimes acts out at me alot especially when it comes to guys. When we have gone to bars people can be cruel saying ""what youre sisters couldnt tell"" or outwardly paying more attention to me. I defend her when I see it but it still hurts her confidence she has cried to me multiple times about dating asking why cant anyone accpet her for who she is. In Jan my boyfriend of 2 yrs cheated on me. My sister told me that maybe he left me because I was too vain and high maitinence. I ignored her. Around the time of the break up she started dating a guy, and I was happy for her. However the guy gave off some weird vibes, the way he looked at my sister when she ate and making plans when my sister and I are supposed to do healthy activities. Since then my sister has gained a massive amount of weight and has become more hostile towards me. Her boyfriend buys her large quantities of unhealthy food and insists that she needs to eat more, he is weirdly touchy with her and often dismisses things she says. They dont talk and just watch tv, she hasnt met his friends or family yet also. She complains how he never posts about her on social media. About a month ago I had a friend over, this friend is interested in fetishes and they regonized my sister's bf from a feeder site, I didnt want to bring it up with my sis because that didnt seem like it was my place but it worried me greatly.I recently downloaded multiple dating apps and my sister like any sister wants to see who I matched with, I showed her and she immediatly said the only reason I got these matches is because I'm shallow. She then told me I might be more sucessful if I stop worrying so much about my looks and said that her boyfriend loves her for her personality not her looks and girls who look really good get men who want them just for their looks. This angered me to the point where I told my sis that her boyfriend is a feeder and he doesnt love her if he did he would put her health over his fetish and actually want to introduce her to the people in his life. My sister has refused to talk to me for a week so far and calls me a horrible person along with my parents joining in."
597,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I cut my boyfriend off financially after he ignored my basic requests?,20092,i2xgut,2418,"Also posted in the advice subreddit. I'm 26F, he is 27M and we have been together for 8 years. I was in a bad car wreck a few months ago after getting T-Boned by a Semi. Because of this I got a check for almost $19k, as well as a brand new vehicle. I practically begged my boyfriend multiple times not to tell anyone we received the money because both of our families suck and like to mooch off of us, even though we are the ones struggling financially and we are the ONLY ones who lost our jobs to Covid. We got laid off within a week of eachother and were both denied for unemployment. So it's been rough. I received the check from the accident 3 days ago. He instantly went and paid $100 to his sister that we owed her and apparently she asked where he got money and despite me telling him not to, he told her I had gotten my check. He instantly told me about it and said that he felt ""cornered"". His sister has that affect on people so I tried to push it out of my mind even though I was peeved. Since that point I have gotten phone calls from all 3 of his brothers, his 2 sisters and even his uncle who I have never even met, due to him living out of state. All of them were asking for money. I hold true to my restrictions and didnt allow anyone to borrow anything because I know they will NOT pay me back and I have more important shit to do with my money (pay bills, rent, pay off my car loan and student debt and put away a big chunk so I can save for a home). The final straw was this morning. I wake up to a call from an unknown number at around 530am and it's his father. Hes like ""Hey Champ, how you doing? How are you recovering?"" So I gave him the run down. Well, before he hangs up he says ""So Julie (my boyfriends sister) told me you got your money. Peter (his step son) turns 5 today and I didnt get my paycheck and I'm fighting with payroll about it. Can you spot me $500?"" I instantly hung up and confronted my boyfriend about it.I told him my basic requests were ignored and that I felt disrespected and that I didnt want people knowing for this exact reason. He told me I was blowing it out of proportion and that I could simply tell them no. I explained that that was besides the point and that I wanted to avoid having to turn people away left and right. He still thinks I'm overreacting. So now I am at a loss where a part of me wants to cut access to my check from him entirely since he cant even follow basic requests. Hes not spending the money or anything like that, especially without asking first but the fact that he told people after I practically begged him not to sits really heavy on me. A part of me knows he is right and that I could just say no but I dont want to have to do that. WIBTA if I cut off his access to this money?EDIT: I truly did not expect this to blow up the way that it did! I went to visit my mom shortly after posting and neglected to check it again until this morning so I have over a thousand notifications. I'm slowly going through all of them and if I dont directly respond to you, I apologize!EDIT: I'm actually going to jump back off this post because now I am becoming slightly irate at people jumping to assumptions without asking for info. First and foremost (I only ready maybe 100 comments), me telling my boyfriend not to discuss my financial matters with his family is not me being controlling, at all. This is my money, not his families, and some shit is on a need to know basis. This is not something they needed to know, period. Secondly, no, him keeping this information isnt something that would have made him uncomfortable. He has no problem withholding this sort of info from my family but when it comes to his own, it's a complete double standard. This has also happened in the past with my tax return money as well, which coincidentally I happened to be conned out of nearly $8k by the same sister in question. She never paid us back. This is also the same family that saw that I needed a place to stay while getting my new home situated and knowingly pushed all their Bill's on me, resulting in me being $1200 in the hole by the time I left their house. My boyfriend doesnt mind these things. But as I said, hes all for helping his family while telling my family to basically go fuck themselves."

I took care of myself starting in high school and so did my twin. He paid his own way through college with no parental help while I built my business also on my own. Our younger siblings did not. Our parents bought them cars in high school, paid 100% of their tuition and living expenses in college, and supported them in starting their adults lives. Both my sisters ended up in bad relationships where they had kids that the fathers eventually had nothing to do with. My parents have always given them plenty of money and support. I just got diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor. It’s inoperable and I am going to die within six months. I have made my peace with it. I opted to leave everything to my brother in my will. That was he can pay off his student loans and have a vehicle and home free and clear. I want to know he has a good life while I’m gone. My parents and sisters found out that I’m leaving everything to him and flipped out. They accused me of favoritism and being a bad daughter, aunt, and sister. They said my parents deserved money for raising me, and that my nieces and nephews deserved my money for future expenses since their mothers couldn’t afford things like cars and college. Even my grandma and my uncle’s wife who I barely see messaged me on Facebook to tell me how selfish I’m being. I blocked all of them in Facebook and told my brother I only wanted him to be at my bedside while I died. AITA for giving my inheritance solely to my brother, and for cutting my family off?"
599,Not the A-hole,"AITA for ruining a 'old mans' reputation? -After he altered a story where I asked him to clean up after his dog, to make me look like the 'bad guy'.",20081,gyyfk1,1076,"(Note, Since people asked this was translated, he was a bit ruder in my native tongue.)Edit: Sorry I can't keep up with the comments anymore!I love dogs.

He woulnd't do that!!Me: Sir I just watched him do it, if you look at the door you can see the pee on there, a puddle-Man: -NO, don't accuse my dog! Everyone here has dogs! Maybe it was your own!Me: Again, I saw him. That golden with the red collar is your dog correct? It was thát dog.Man -Full volume-: MY DOG DID NOT PEE ON YOUR CAR!

My sponge got sand in it and was ruined.. I ended up washing my car door, neighbour got a broom 'n cleaned the sidewalk.Later he posted a nasty topic on a neighbourhood info/watch app, he obv didnt expect me to be on there. He fabricated a story: That I am a doghater that tried to force a reumatic 'old' man to clean his entire car, while he was just walking past. He is afraid of me now blabla. Mentioned my name/info too.I replied with screenshots of him (security cam) With his dog peeing on my car, + picked out the worst looking screenshots of him getting in my face/ knocking over my bucket, also one of him dragging his dog away by its neck that caused a big backlash. And wrote what really happened. My neighbour thinks I went too far because some of our neighbourhood people are apparently 'after' him on the app now sending nasty messages. He said I made it look worse than it was by picking those specific images, that he was just a old grumpy man having a bad day. I feel justified though, because he tried to paint me off as a horrible person and I just stated the truth. AITA?Ps. I did not add his info- despite him adding mine."
600,Not the A-hole,AITA For making my little sister walk home.,20072,dom0df,3058,"So recently I got my license and my dad thought it would be a good idea for me to drive my little sister home. She would normally walk speaking she falls right under the 1.5 mile rule our school system implemented. The first few days went fine but then she unplugged my phone from the aux cord and started blasting her music. I took notice by not moving and giving her a funny look. She replied with a snarky what and I asked her why she unplugged my phone. She responds with ""I got tired of listening to your music"". I told her that if she wants a ride home she'll have to listen to my music. I then unplugged her phone and started driving. Then she gets bold and while I'm driving unplugs my phone and starts playing her music again. So I pullover and tell her to get out. She kinda sat there and looked confused but after repeating myself a few times she hopped out. I wasn't expecting the backlash from my stepmom when I got home. She was pissed and ""threatened"" me with calling my dad and telling him about my reckless behavior. She went on to call me an ego maniac and other names. When my dad got home it started a argument between them because he thinks I was justified. From my POV she's a 7th grader that should understand that her actions have consequences. I understand it is a little thing but I gave her a warning and she didn't respect it.EDIT: It is my vehicle I pay gas and Insurance. I didn't feel like this was relevant but I digress. EDIT 2: I drive a coupe so I don't have backseats."
601,Not the A-hole,AITA if I back out of being maid of honor at my best friends wedding next weekend? Best man is my ex fiancé who cheated on me and I can't be around him let alone walk arm in arm with him.,20058,bkpb4c,1717,"Jump into the worst week of my life. I was with my ex fiancé for 6 years. Loved him with every fiber of my being, wedding planned for August. Refused a job offer so could move with him for his next Air Force assignment. Monday a call girl from a website called massage republic texts him in the middle of the night saying she's reaching out to old clients because she's back in the game (his phone was at my house while he was flying) I text back she must have wrong number. She says she doesn't. In a moment of brains I pretend to be him instead of the jealous girlfriend and call girl gives me all the details. I'm such a fool this had been happening under my nose for years. I confront him, he claims to be a sex addict and promises to change. I consider it for half a second and say no. Cue uncontrollable crying, self doubt, a battery of STD tests, awkward encounters with him, fight over the ring, his mom (who I loved) calling me non stop and begging me to reconsider and on and on. And on top of all this my best friend is marrying his best friend may 11th. Groom doesn't want to rock the boat at this late date and selecting a new best man. Bride says she has way too much in her plate and is begging me to just go through with it and she'll ""make it up to me."" I've never hated a human being as much as I hate him. I can't be in the same room with him let alone walk arm in arm with him. I understand the whole wedding doesn't need to fall apart because I'm upset. so I just want to not go and spend the day downing the left over percocets from my wisdom teeth operation, fucking as many tinder dudes who can stand to be around me after not showering and burning all his shit. Woukd I be the asshole if I back out of the wedding?Edit: wow I checked out for a few hours to try and sleep and this exploded. I’m so sorry I haven’t been reading I’ll try and catch upEdit 2: ok guys I don't know what the verdict is but whether or not you voted yta or NTA and said I should go anyways to support my friend (we were friends before we were born, our moms were college roommates) your argument were the most convincing. I'm going to suck it up, participate, have fun, make my lock screen image the text from ""Panama"" where she said ""remember, you liked tounging my asshole?"" so when I get sad I have an instant reminder of who he really is. And then when it's all over I'm going to scream myself hoarse and beat the ever living fuck out of my pillows. If I can update a week from now I will. I still have a lot of reading to do so thank you all for commenting.Edit 3 (that wont be seen): guys I've had the worst week of my life and been crying almost non stop since 3AM last  Monday (or Tuesday, or whatever). I have to clear up people calling my best friend the asshole. That just isn't the case, at all. I love her as much as I love any person on the planet and she has my back. But this wedding is now a week away. It's not a simple thing of kicked me out or asking ex-fiancé not to come. Everyone is furious with him but only she, me and he know the details of call girls. My ex's parents, grandparents and everyone else are going to be at the wedding. He's as close with the groom as I am with her. If they make big changes now then the day becomes about what HE did, not about the wedding. It's not my place to demand the groom change his best man... a week out no less...plus like I said he knows my ex cheated, he doesn't know my ex was sleeping with prostitutes. If I bring that up then this whole week becomes about THAT. My best friend and her groom being assholes isn't even an option on the table. They didn't do anything wrong and just reacting with the best information they have. My friend has offered me the chance to allow me and ex-fiancé to walk in with other people or even separately, but I'm not going to do that. First of all because I think it will look weird. And secondly I foresee getting a sick since of satisfaction of touching him ONE LAST TIME--FOREVER and have him know that that spark he feels...could have been forever come August but he fucked it up."
602,Not the A-hole,AITA for letting my sons girlfriend sleep in his room,20028,g1js19,543,"So I’m a single dad of my 19 year old son. He’s been dating a girl from his college since the beginning of freshman year, and when he came back she asked if she could stay with me instead of her parents. I thought about it pretty deeply because I didn’t really know how I felt about it at first, but I have a lot of extra space and I figured if I said no they’d try and see each other anyway despite the stay at home orders. I’ve been treating it as close to a regular roommate situation as I can, although he is my son so it’s not quite the same, but my house is big enough that they can keep to themselves without bothering me.And not that I’ve been trying to listen to their conversations, but from what I’ve heard they’re very good for each other. They’re always very happy and nice to each other and there doesn’t seem to be any conflicts.Anyway when she first moved in her parents had a meltdown, they called me and demanded I kick her out and make her go home. I told them I wasn’t going to do that and if she wants to leave she’s free to. She has her own car and it’s only a 45 minute drive to her home town. They berated me over the phone a few times and then finally gave in and let her stay. Apparently she let it slip over video chat that they’ve been sleeping in the same room(I don’t really know what her parents expected when she moved in with him... but ok) and they called me again and demanded I separate them. I told them that again if she wants to leave I’m not keeping her, she has the means to go home, it’s not like I’ve locked them in the same room. And there’s a third spare bedroom that she can stay in if she decides she for some reason does want to be separated. They said that I know what they’re doing in there and that it’s a tragedy that I’m endorsing it. From my point of view is they’re both the same age, technically adults, they can serve in the military, I’m sure whatever they do in there they were doing at college. They’re old enough to decide for themselves what they want to do.AITA here?Edit: for clarity she is also 19."
603,Not the A-hole,AITA for keeping my grandmothers ring when it was given to me by “mistake”?,20020,d0lpvl,1480,"My grandmother passed earlier this year and she had a pretty nice jewelry collection. Before she passed she knew what went to who and had had me meet to see what I’d like. Instead of jewelry I asked for her wedding dress. No one else wanted it, I had gotten married in it, and she was really touched. After talking to her kids she went ahead and gave it to me before passing. When she did pass away I was surprised she hadn’t written down who got what pieces. Since I had already passed on inheritance of a piece I didn’t go to the meeting with the rest of the family. Basically they sat down and went oldest to youngest and let each person pick until there were no pieces. From what I heard it was peaceful and everyone was happy. Since I wasn’t there they still wanted me to have something and picked a ring they thought had fake diamonds. It was the biggest and they assumed it was a diamond substitute. It was sweet of them to do that, so I could have a piece of her everyday too. When I got the ring I didn’t examine it. It was big enough I thought it was fake too. But then I saw a diamond on the inside band (indicating Leo diamonds). I took it to get it evaluated and it has real diamonds. It’s value is about 5k more than her next expensive piece (they had the papers on all of those). Essentially I got a nicer and more expensive piece than even her oldest daughter. But they chose it for me. Now, they want to redo the distribution. But I feel like it’s fair. I didn’t ask for anything, they gave me something anyways, now they realize the value of it and want it back. AITA if I refuse?Edit to add INFO:I didn’t tell anyone. The jeweler mentioned it to my Aunt and it got around to the rest of the family."
604,Not the A-hole,AITA for making a complaint against a nursery worker due to how she reacted to my wife picking our kid up?,20020,gugl7y,1561,"My wife (36) and I (37M) have 2 kids, a daughter (8) and a son (3). My wife is an essential worker as she’s a doctor. She works extremely long hours with hardly any days off whilst I work a typical 9-5 job so I’ve always taken care of arranging the kids for school and care etc.Well with lockdown, I’ve been able to homeschool my daughter but since my wife is an essential worker, my sons nursery has still been able to take him in so I have dropped him off there as normal as even though I’m homeschooling my other kid, I’m fitting that around me working from home. It makes it easier for my son to still have his routine and so I can do my work and so on.Anyway, I was going to pick him up like normal but my wife chose to do it as she was off at that time and could actually get him. The people at this nursery know my wife as do the parents even though she’s rarely there. She was actually happy to be able to pick our son up from nursery for once and I thought it went fine until she came home in tears.She told me this nursery worker who has just started there didn’t believe that my wife was our sons mother as this worker had only ever seen me. The other workers and my son told her that my wife was in fact the mother and that she wasn’t a danger to my son. The new worker still didn’t believe it and said that she didn’t feel comfortable with letting a 3 year old go off with a random woman she’d never seen before. My wife got really upset and it in then upset my son as everybody was practically saying there was no danger as my wife was a mother. A few other parents got dragged into this and backed up the other staff and it was only through relenting that the new worker gave up but she made a really angry comment along the lines of, “maybe if you were here more often, I wouldn’t have to verify your identity.”My wife wants to forget it happened but I am very angry so the next day I picked up my son and asked to speak the woman in charge about the new worker. She wasn’t there when it happened but I complained and said that how my wife was treated was ridiculous and that the coworker was out of line for her snide comment at the end. The woman wasn’t happy and I’ve now learnt the new worker has been given a severe warning and that her behaviour is being watched.The parents who backed my wife up are torn. Some think I did the right thing as the woman didn’t act professional whilst others think I’m an Ah for interfering. My wife is annoyed as she thinks I shouldn’t have said anything. I really don’t know if what I did was right or wrong so am I the AH?"
605,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling my mom I own her house?,20014,jxtred,848,"My wife and I have been having a discussion and she finds it really weird that I’m keeping this secret.I bought a house prior to covid and so during the lockdowns I was able to get some really cheap contracting done because people needed work.  I got it fixed up to rent it out, not to my mom, but just anybody.  When it became clear people were losing jobs I didn’t want to rent to a stranger just to kick them out:  so I kept renovating at a slow pace just to keep the house on the ups.Fast forward.  I find out my mom is being evicted for not paying rent.  I refuse to send my mom money.  I used to and it damn near made me broke.  She has a gambling addiction and drinking problem.  She lost her job.  So I tell her I have a friend who owns a house one state over.   With nothing to lose she found a job out of state, applied With an agent I know out there who handled the beginning part but really it’s my house and she wouldn’t have been approved otherwise I rent it to her at below market rate but enough to where I know she’s not wasting all money on gambling and drinking.  My brother and his son also live there. She didn’t tell “management” that go figure.  So my wife is like, I want to go see the house.  I tell her what I did and she doesn’t seem to understand that I never told my mom it’s my house and why.  As soon as I tell her it’s my house she’s going to go back to being irresponsible and it’s bad enough my brother is freeloading there too but this is going to be a financial burden on us if we tell her.  As of now, it’s not because she thinks some company owns it."
606,Not the A-hole,AITA for letting my picky eater child go hungry?,20005,bs3303,3819,"My four year old has decided to become a picky eater. He doesn't have autism or anything else that causes sensory issues, he's just picky now, he used to be willing to eat anything. If he had his way he'd only eat french fries and Goldfish. Obviously I'm not going to let him only eat those two things. I'm also not going to be bossed around by a toddler. What I've been doing is that if he turns up his nose at a meal, I'll just say something like ""Alright, I guess you can eat this later"" and put the food in the fridge. If he asks for a snack, I offer him the food, and if he refuses, no snacks except for milk at the next meal, I'll offer it to him then if he didn't eat it before. He carries on for a bit, but he eventually gets hungry enough that he'll eat whatever it was he was refusing to eat before. He's never gone more than a day of refusing to eat, if he did I'd probably feed him something else. My mom friends are horrified I'd do this to my kid, and tell me I'm old fashioned. I also feel like the worst mother in the world when my kid is whining about how hungry he is. For the record my husband is completely on board with this method. AITA for letting him go hungry?EDIT: This must have reached the front page or something, thanks for all your comments, I'm a bit too overwhelmed to reply to them all. Even though this sub I just want to address some common points:\-I don't want to force him to eat things he hates, I do want to promote his individuality. I feel like I have no other choice but to be strict because if I'm not he'd have me serving him an unhealthy diet.\-I don't want him to grow up thinking he's entitled to order me or anyone else to cook special meals for him.\-I do season my food and cook it in other ways besides steaming or boiling.\-I would never let him not eat for a long time like some of you have described. Or try to serve him uneaten food for days on end like Mommie Dearest. I'd cave at that point."
607,Not the A-hole,AITA For refusing a necklace with my son's ashes after my husband let his mother take the urn?,20001,j45ufi,3808,"My son Tom passed away 4 months ago, at the age of 6, he had a heart condition that robbed him of living his childhood like any other kid, He was such an angel and he loved food so much, I tried to feed him as much as I could because he was so thin and didn't have enough energy to run around and play because of his condition.My husband's family were directly involved in my son's care, they were always there but they never stayed at the hospital so I could go home and get some sleep, they stopped their kids from being around him, they did not help at all, when my son passed away, they felt free to take his belongings, clothes/toys/blankets and my mother in law insisted to have a burial service but I chose to have him cremated and kept his ashes in an urn inside my bedroom.My mother in law started visiting regularly (she didn't do that when he was alive just visited the hospital) and she started talking about making ashes pendants for me, my husband and her family as a way to carry Tom's memory with us and keep him close wherever we go, she told me that my brother in law loved Tom so much and wanted a pendant made for him as well, I was stunned and I didn't know what to tell her, I remember telling her that this was never gonna happen, and that all those family members have their kids with them and that I was the one who lost a son, she started arguing talking about how important Tom was to her and the family and that my husband would agree with this fair treatment instead of keeping an urn in my bedroom and refusing to let the family share their grieve, I told her there was no way I'd say yes, she seemed so upset and took it personally, started berating me and talking about how everyone else was trying to show support and that was the last time we spoke.I got invited to a road trip by my family to help get me relieve so much stress, and when I returned after 6 days, I found that my son's urn was gone, my husband showed me a necklace that he said had my son's ashes in it and pulled out another one that belonged to him that was in the shape of cross, he told me that his mom made necklaces for me, him, her,brother in law with our son's ashes, paid money to get it done and so we could all have Tom with us, I was in a shock I had to sit down for a minute, turned out he allowed his mom to take the urn while I was gone, and his defense was that his family cared so much for Tom and they all deserved to keep a momerial necklace as a way to remember him,I yelled at him that this was my son not theirs, she had no right to take the urn and do what she wanted with it especially when I told her no, I was so mad with him, I couldn't even look at him, I took my things and went back to my family and refused to take the necklace that she ""put thousands"" on, I called her and berated her for her awful behavior and told her she was selfish and inconsiderate for taking my son from me like that, my husband is trying to apologize but I can't accept he did this and betrayed me."
608,Not the A-hole,AITA For reporting my son's doctor after she shared his medical information with my mother in law?,19991,jyzogq,1844,My F38 son 9 has a medical condition. We're struggling so much trying to do everything we can to help him deal and cope with his condition. It's been difficult enough without my mother in law getting involved and making decisions without talking to me and my husband first. She'd completely disregard our fears and concerns as parents and claim we don't know what's best for her grandson by trying to control doctors appointments/arguing with doctors. Criticizing and telling them how to do their job/ bringing medication that her friend doctor prescribed without even diagnosing my son.She'd get mad if we don't comply and do what she tells us. Her latest stunt was showing up at my son's appointment and making a scene resulting in me and my husband going no contact and changing the clinic by having my son's medical file transformed to another clinic.My mother in law was removed from any emergency contact we had before and we made it clear to the new doctor to not share our son's medical information. My mother in law kept trying to find out what clinic/which doctor our son goes to and she tried to guilty tip my husband and also get the family to pressure us into letting her know. No one realized the negative affect she had on my son's health and progress and the family kept calling me awful and resentful because she's just worried for her grandson.Last week. I found out that my mother in law was at the clinic and was speaking to my son's pediatrician about my son's condition. My husband told me his mom called and told him she was talking to the doctor discussing our son's condition. He told me he didn't want to speak to his mom but she called to let him know that she has a right to take part in her grandson's care and that we shouldn't try to hide things from her since she eventually was able to find out.I was livid. I was so angry I went to talk to the doctor about the conversation she had with my mother in law and the fact that she disclosed medical information after being told several times that this would cause us plenty of issues because of my mother in law's behavior. Mother in law is already trying to get involved and I just couldn't take it. I reported the doctor and filled an HIPAA complaint.I was told to back off but I couldn't take this massive lack of professionalism on the doctor's part and the fact that now I'm having to deal with my mother in law's attempts to control the situation.My mother in law spread the news about the doctor and the whole family was stunned saying my bitterness jeopardized the doctor's career and that she only shared information with my son's grandmother not some stranger. Also said that I'm not being focused on my son and choosing to start arguments instead. Basically made it look like it's my fault. I'm so tired and I can't take it anymore. My husband agrees that I shouldn't have filed a complaint like he has no problem with his mother now showing up at the clinic and causing scenes.Information to add here: my son goes to a licensed medical doctor. Mother in law says she knows a doctor that happens to be friend of hers but I'm not sure if he even has a license or even work at the hospital or clinic we were never told who he was nor even met him before. But that was before the fight we had with her. She no longer mentions him and is focused on getting directly involved with my son's care.
609,Not the A-hole,AITA for pointing out that my co-worker is trans/doesn't pass?,19966,do75t3,758,"Alright.I'm a European woman in her mid-twenties who recently moved to San Francisco for a fancy-pants internship. It was a huge culture shock, but in a way, a welcome one- I'm gay (the very girly type people don't really clock as gay, but still) and this is the first time I've ever been out at work.There is one co-worker who we shall call Linda. She's a trans woman (MtF).Linda's position means that me and she and I don't really interact at work often. Therefore, I was told about her before I met her. One of my co-workers told me that she existed, I was due to meet her next week, and that she was a trans woman who uses she/her pronouns. I met Linda, didn't even ask for her pronouns and just used she/her, everything went alright, I thought that was the end of it.Now, Linda does not pass as a cis woman.  She's still a woman and I'd never misgender her, but it is objectively visible that this is probably a trans woman, not a cis one.This now caused an issue. A few of us had a Halloween get-together and invited Linda. At some point, she and I were alone at our table. We got talking about what it was like for me being this very girly gay woman in a male-dominated field in a conservative European country. At some point, I made a remark along the lines of 'but of course, you as a trans woman probably faced similar experiences'.Her face just fell. She started hissing at me about how dare I presume she's trans, she hasn't been misgendered (I did NOT misgender her, at no point did I use 'he' or anything like that- I just said she was trans, which...she is) in years, and no one at work has ever had to ask for her pronouns etc. Drunk idiot I was, I blurted out 'but...we all know?' Which we do.I was extremely confused. Apparently, out of the younger group of co-workers, no one ever actually asked her for her pronouns or gender identity because we all, just like me, got told by some colleague who'd been there longer that this was a trans woman who uses female pronouns. This somehow led Linda to believe that we didn't 'clock' her, which was a huge source of self-esteem for her.Linda now, and I say this without a hint of exaggeration, hates my guts. She confided to another coworker that she's extremely hurt by me pointing out that she doesn't pass and that it was invasive and rude and how dare I judge her. I, on the other hand, don't really know what the hell happened here. She is trans, that is a fact of life, everyone knows and it is clearly visible.AITA for saying what I said?"

At around 10 I decided to text Hannah's mum to ask how it's going and she gets super confused at my question, I said you have my daughter right? she goes no, hannah is with her dad this weekend I have no teens with me atm. so she calls Hannah's dad to sort the situation out and he tells her that he is still at work and hannah should be home alone. I walk over to Hannah's mums house and we drive up to Hannah's dads. turns out hannah and my daughter wanted to get drunk and throw a house party with older guys, I was seeing red at this point and grabbed her by the arm and dragged her out. when we got home I made her hand over her phone and laptop which she has lost the privilege of having for 2 weeks (exluding school work) and she is banned from going to the shops with friends for 2 months. my family/ some friends are saying that's a tad harsh and now I'm worried I made the punishment to long. aita?

On the day that I gave birth, Anna's brother got into a car accident. My husband got a call from her in the middle of the night and asked him if he could drop her at the hospital her brother was at (an hour away from us) since she was too scared to drive. My husband agreed, told me quickly while I was half-asleep and rushed out. A few hours later, I had contractions and called my husband. He didn't pick up after multiple tries so I gave up and called my Dad, who drove me to the local hospital (12 minutes away). I was so scared of giving birth alone since I've had about 3 miscarriages and 1 stillborn. My husband promised me that no matter what, he'd be there for me. Guess what? He wasn't. We called multiple times while I was in labor and when he finally picked up my Dad's call when I was giving birth, saying that he'd misplaced his phone in the chaos, my Dad informed him that no matter how fast he drives anymore, he's going to miss the birth of his child. Well, my husband took that as ""he's already screwed up, so it doesn't matter when he shows up at this point"" so when he FINALLY came, our daughter was about 5 hours old and I'd already moved to the maternity ward. When he came, I refused to let him see our baby (edit: did let husband hold and play with baby after discharge) because I was so high on emotions and was shaking when I saw him and didn't want it negatively affect my time with the baby. I wanted her birth to be a happy time and I was already struggling to feed her. My husband was in a bad state and told me to please let him see her, so I told him to stand by the window and held the baby up so he could see her. I told him to then leave and he'll be allowed to interact with the baby at my father's home when we're both well and out of the hospital and that I was most likely divorcing him. He starting bawling and apologizing and defended himself by saying that Anna's brother was in serious critical condition and although he's fine, Anna needed him. Though Anna's parents were there, she's not that close with them and she was in an unbearable state. I told him that I didn't care and that his daughter has already come second to him and all she did was be born. I'm putting my daughter's and my health first and won't let her be sidelined. My husband agreed and left. However, Anna called me later and said that I was being controlling and she'd never met someone as cruel as me for not letting a father see his baby. I told her that my husband made his decision and that this was his doing not mine. But now, I can't help feel cruel in my actions and feel like I'm depriving my baby of both her parents being together. My husband sees her a few hours each day now. AITA?Edit: I feel like this is useful information and could explain why I was so mad. Anna’s brother was not in a life/death situation. He had serious injuries, but most were concentrated on his legs and arm. He did have a concussion but gained consciousness soon. Anna was there along with both her parents who managed all the hospital stuff. My husband was there as a emotional support for Anna. I did let my husband see our baby, right after I got discharged (Edit: husband saw baby, husband held baby, husband played with baby). I wanted a couple days of rest and bonding with the baby since my emotions were so high and I was afraid if my husband was a continuous presence, I’d get stressed and something bad would happen. I told him as such. They spend time together, but I’m still cold with him. I may still be the asshole, I don’t know, but I’m still so mad at him and it’s not the first time he put Anna before me. I can forgive the other times since I could handle it but this time was the straw. I was so scared to hold my baby because I was paranoid the minute I touch her, something would happen to her and no one was there to comfort me. I only had my dad but he wasn’t in the delivery room which is why i’m not too keen on forgiving my husband.Also, we both knew the baby was due anytime now so I don’t understand why my husband didn’t have his phone on him. We even tried reaching out to Anna and she didn’t pick up either.After he learned I was giving birth, they already knew that Anna’s brother was going to be alright. He spent that time making sure that Anna was okay and feeding her and then waiting for the brother to regain consciousness. He could’ve come back after seeing his daughter to talk with the brother. He would’ve made it back in time.Edit: So many of you got it wrong. I’m not preventing him from EVER seeing his baby, that is stupid and unreasonable. He literally saw her about a day later when we were discharged and safely at my dads home. He already didn’t see her for 5 hours on purpose and put Anna first, I didn’t think an additional day would make much of a difference. And it wasn’t to him, he was happy to see the baby and he spends time with her all the time. She’s two months now.And also, I’m not mad about the fact he went to see Anna, I’m mad that he didn’t think we were a high priority to rush back to. He left me so quickly in the middle of the night when I was already late, he couldn’t have left Anna in the care of her parents and rushed as soon as possible? She’s not a child and she doesn’t have any mental health issues either.Edit 3: So sorry for all the edits! But someone just messaged me this: What if my baby was born a stillborn again? He had no way to know since he and I didn’t have ANY contact after I gave birth. Thank the stars, my baby is healthy and well but it was a possibility.Edit/Update: Thank you everyone for your replies. I think that I was an asshole for using my child against him and should have told him that he could hold and then asked him to leave. So the divorce is probably going to happen. My brother is looking at lawyers for me. In the midst of this whole mess, this post made me realize I never checked on Anna’s brother to see how he’s healing because I was so irked by Anna. I called him and he said that he was doing well and will be out of his wheelchair soon. He asked about me and the baby and how I was doing with the split and if I was okay with my husband and ... Anna. I can’t believe I was so oblivious. I thought they had an emotional thing going on because of this and when I confronted my husband, he denied it and said me and our baby were his priority and he made a “mistake” and he was being dumb. Yea no, Anna’s brother kindly informed me that he and Anna’s parents thought that my husband and I split when I was 7 months pregnant and that Anna and him were back on. He showed up at the hospital as Anna’s boyfriend which is why they didn’t bat an eye that he was there and not with his pregnant wife. Because apparently we split. Her brothers procedures were done well before the afternoon so I don’t know that my husband and Anna were doing for all those hours, but I don’t even wanna know. If you want more details, I can answer in a comment. Thanks everyone for your kind words and advice. I will be moving back home and filing for full custody. I don’t want my baby growing up to be like her father or Anna. He can be fun dad or whatever it is he wants to be.Last edit: I think i’m going to be taking a break from reddit now because ranting on the internet doesn’t seem healthy. Thanks everyone for their support. I’ll take it from here ❤️."
612,Not the A-hole,AITA my boyfriend wont let me get a breast reduction?,19943,g5n4a3,1064,"tldr: i have large breasts that have caused me nothing but back pain, and my boyfriend thinks im self centered for wanting a reduction. For context, I (26F) was born with unfortunately large  breasts. currently my bra size is that of a whopping 38 E. Because of this, ive had INTENSE back pain, shoulder pain, etc growing up. Starting a few months ago, the pain had only gotten worse and worse- It seemed i couldnt go an hour without having to dramatically crack my back and swallow ibuprofen and still have to suffer pain. Ive tried yoga, stretching, exercising, and everything to try to eliminate back pain (i hoped that with a stronger core or something I'd be able to support my own chest), buy I've only found that it makes it worse.So i did some research and found that a breast reduction was just what i needed- I thought about going down to a C cup or even a B. I wanted my back pain to be COMPLETELY gone. So, about a week ago, I brought up with my boyfriend (28M), thinking he'd take it well (he's always been supportive of me, so i trusted him) and he was PISSED. He told me that i was throwing away my body and ""caving in"" to ""societal pressure"". He said there was no reason to change my tit size, and that if i did, he wouldn't be attracted to me anymore. We argued about it for a good 2 hours before he tried to ""compromise"" with me and say he was alright with it as long as i didnt go below a D cup, because anything smaller than that was ""childish"". He also called me egotistical and self absorbed, asking me why i didnt talk to him about it sooner, or think he would care about it. I told him I didnt think he'd care so much about me changing MY body, and he stormed out of the room and has been passive aggressively ignoring me ever since, even to the extent that he wont say i love you back, or sleep in the same bed as me. So, Reddit, i just need to know. Am i the asshole for this?EDIT: 😂😂😂 I was not born with large breasts, but they are a genetic thing that ive had since i was about 16!EDIT that im sure no one will see: As of May 15, after finally deciding to professionally measure myself, i am not a 38E, but rather, a 34H. Not sure how i could have messed up to drastically 😂 Also, I dumped the boyfriend! Good riddance"
613,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling my dad’s wife weak?,19946,hq3y9n,1140,"Backstory:My (16F) dad and mom (both 37F&40M) got a divorce two years ago because my father cheated on my mother, her (the mistress) and my dad got married two months after my parents got a divorce.My parents have joint custody of me and my siblings (17M & 16M (my twin brother), we’re all close and decided we wanted to visit our father, his wife and her kids (16&15F, the father passed) every two weeks since it was either that or we’d have to spend our holidays with them (mother’s orders) which we all didn’t want.I don’t like the two teenage girls and neither do my brothers, they’ve called us the n word multiple times (our dad is Italian while our mom is black, my stepsisters&stepmom are white), usually stay out late, smoke etc.Story:We were at my dad’s house, my brother (twin) and I were playing video games in the living room, my stepsister (16) wanted to watch tv even though she has a tv in her room, we told her to give us half an hour since we hadn’t been playing for long, my stepsister called us both ‘ghetto n——‘ out of nowhere and my stepmother came downstairs to ask what happened.I explained to her what happened and she told me “Anna (random name), I’ve talked to you about this, stop being weak.”I asked her if my stepsister would be getting a consequence and she told me no because I was being weak, then added “for a black girl”.I responded by saying, “I’m weak yet you don’t have enough respect for yourself to leave a man who forgot to tell you he had a wife and kids.” since she wasn’t aware my father had a family while he was cheating with her.She went ballistic and my brother (17) who had just woken up had to hold her back, I feel kind of guilty but I also don’t.Now I’m waiting for my dad to get home.AITA?Edit: No, my parents don’t know about the racismEdit 2: My mother wants us to have a relationship with our father and I’m not sure if my dad is aware of the racismEdit 3: To all the people asking, I’ll post an update laterEdit 4: I just checked FAQ about updates and it turns out I can’t create an update post because it hasn’t been that long since I posted this post. I do want to say thanks for all the advice, last night didn’t end well tbh, I might make another post on a different sub since I’m looking for more advice anyway since the situation is getting out of hand, thank you."
614,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my sister I am never babysitting or being childcare for her and her husband again?,19927,jzhcff,1081,"My (29f) sister (32f) asked me if I could babysit Thursday and Friday afternoon's after school for her and her husband while they work. I said sure, no problem. I love my niece and nephew and I love spending time with them. It was also a nice way to get to know her husbands two kids better when they had them. It has worked great for three years I have been doing it. Then I started doing an occasional Saturday night for their date nights.For a while I have had some issues with her husband. There were nights he didn't have his kids from a previous relationship but he wanted me to babysit as well and I never felt comfortable with this. When it is his parenting time absolutely no problem. But I know his ex from a past job and I do not want to get involved with her level of crazy which babysitting on her parenting time could potentially bring to my door. My sister and I talked about this before and she got him to back off for the most part. Because of this I was happy to continue.So last Saturday I was supposed to babysit for them to have a kid free night after months of craziness due to Covid. My sisters husband shows up with all the kids (because it was their parenting time) AND his ex's younger child and her boyfriends kids. Nobody said anything to me. I never agreed to have all those kids and at the door he acted like an ass because I told him I was not babysitting all those kids.I called my sister and she said she had no idea he would do that. I told her that I am tired of him pushing and that last night crossed a line for me and I am not willing to subject myself to the pressure again. Not to mention it made me feel like an ass having to deal with it while all the kids were standing there. Some of whom I had never laid eyes on before.My sister is understandably hurt but said she understands. Her husband is telling me I'm an asshole for dropping out of things on such short notice.Am I?AITA?"
615,Not the A-hole,AITA for forbidding my wife to go to her affair partner's funeral?,19927,c219rs,4773,"Married 15 years and almost didn't make it this far.  In our second year of marriage my wife went home when I was deployed and slept with Some Dickhead (who I'll refer to as SD from here out) who she was loose acquaintances with growing up.  She hadn't seen him in years but he just happened to show up during my daughter's birthday party because he was the son of one of my mother-in-law's old friends.  SD and my wife hooked up later that week after reconnecting.The reason I didn't kick my wife's ass to the curb and eventually forgave her is because she told me herself soon after I got home.  And she didn't try to justify it with the ""oh well you were gone, i felt lonely blah blah blah"".  No she actually said straight up that she was a fucking dumbass (her words not mine, though I agree) and she felt so sick and disgusting for doing it.She immediately cut off all contact with SD and it took a lot of counseling and healing but here we are today feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that I was right to keep her.Well my mother-in-law called yesterday and she heard from SD's mother that SD died in some workplace accident and they're having a funeral service this weekend.My wife told me this and that she wanted to go and it was like I got kicked right in the dick.  I instantly felt nauseous and had fucking horrible flashbacks of when she told me about her affair. All those horrible feelings resurfaced along with the shitty memories of me crying my fucking eyes out and my image of her shattering.  The pain felt as fresh as when she dropped that bomb on me.I asked her why seeing as she hadn't talked to the guy in over a decade not to mention...you know....she fucked him while we were married.  She keeps saying shit like ""it's the right thing to do"" and ""she just wants to pay respects"".I can't stop repeating that I'm so hurt with that decision as he's had no part of her life in so long and I'm re-living all those shitty nights I was sure our family would be shattered and I would only see my daughter 50% of the time.After some back and forth I put my fucking foot down and told her NO, she cannot go.  I said it's so disrespectful to me and our marriage and we've been on the silent treatment since then.  AITA?EDIT: Seems like people are starting to trip up on me saying ""feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that I was right to keep her."" as if I'm saying I own her and she's a piece of property to me.  That is not the case, I am simply illustrating that she didn't just say she'll do better, she proved it with her actions and has made me a very happy man in our time together.EDIT 2: I apologize for nothing and honestly it brings a happy tear to my eye to to see so many people referring to him as SD, because that's what he was.  Fuck 'im.A lot of people are saying it's her decision to make and it is but that doesn't mean I have to like it or support it, and yes right at this point I can see myself walking away if she insists on going.  We're going to counseling starting tomorrow"
616,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to support our daughter after she gives birth?,19899,hd4tiv,1162,"Edit: Thank you so much for your kind responses, I've tried to read all the comments but this blew up overnight. However some general things: 1. Our 27f daughter assumed she could live with and be financially supported by us in the year after her child was born because our eldest went through significant financial hardship when she was trying to have a baby due to paying for ivf/fertility treatments and as a result almost ended up homeless because they remortgaged their house to afford it but then her husband was in a car accident and needed time off work meaning they were unable to pay their mortgage and the bank claimed their home.2. I dunno what I can say to convince you this is real, yes its from a throwaway because my main account has part of my real name on it and both my 27f daughter and my son and his wife are familiar with it. There were 3 edits to this post. Originally it included a couple of paragraphs about how our 27f daughter made some homophobic comments about my wife's brother getting married to another man, and also some statements she made towards the BLM movement, however that post was over the 3000 word count and i decided to remove them as they aren't applicable to the current situation and i wanted to focus more on our immediate family issue rather than get into a big lgbt/blm argument. When I reposted it the post was removed because ""this is not a debate sub"", so I changed the title and reposted it as it is.3. My wife and i have been supporters of the blm movement since before we got married 33 years ago, I came from a very racist family who disowned my older sister for marrying a black man and then kicked me out as a 16yo for sneaking out of the house so I could go to my sisters wedding. We haven't really been LGBT supporters(we haven't been anti LGBT, just not a part of rallies/donations) until my wife's brother came out a few years ago and since then we have made more of an effort to go to parades and donation to things like the Trevor project.Second edit to say that our 27yo daughter will not be homeless if we don't support her for the year following the birth. It was just supposed to be an opportunity for her to spend time with us as otherwise they live over 2 hours away. As far as Im aware they own their home outright and her husband is financially well off enough to support her during this time without our help. Also our adoptive grandson is only 9 so a bit young to understand why some parts of the family don't like him. I'm not going to go into real detail but essentially my 27f daughter has recently said some very racist things. Since she married her husband she seems to have changed as a person and is much more distant and vicious towards the family, things came to a head last weekend at our first big family get together since covid when she said that our eldest daughters adopted son(who is black, he was adopted because our eldest and her husband are unable to have children) ""wasnt really a part of the family"" and that ""God didn't mean for you(eldest daughter) to have children, just accept what he gave you and stop forcing your options(referring to the son) on the rest of us"". Our eldest and her son were devastated and some very heated words were exchanged before my 27yo daughter and her husband stormed out. Now recently our 27yo daughter has announced she is pregnant, she and her husband were planning on moving into the cottage on our property after the baby is born so my wife and I can help out for the first year. During this time our daughter doesn't plan on working and has been clear that she expects us to contribute to her financial costs during the year(we had a similar arrangement with our eldest whe she was trying for a baby, and our son and his wife also spent 6 months living in the cottage after their twins were born). However after discussing with my wife we feel that this would make the rest of the family uncomfortable with visiting us(obviously eldest and her son no longer want to cone over while 27f and her husband are here and pur sons Latina wife has also expressed her discomfort around 27f and her husband)and we are uncomfortable supporting people who are so blatantly racist. We told our daughter last Thursday in a zoom chat about our decision and she blew up at us, demanding to know why she wasn't allowed to express her option and arguing that we aren't black so why should we care? My wife became very upset and closed the chat and has refused to speak to our daughter since and she is blaming herself for not raising her better. Are we the assholes here?"
617,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking my husband out of the house because he lied to me about money,19878,d6v6mz,4309,"My husband hid $1500 (some insurance payout) from me and he played the whole “I don’t have money for gas” victim part. This money is not part of our savings or anything. Anyway, he had been hiding the money for 2 weeks. During those two weeks I bought groceries for us, I paid for our take out food, I offered to pay for his broken windshield, and overall I was concerned about whether or not he had enough money for himself. He saw me struggle putting to put gas in my truck. He let me pay for his car insurance. He heard my concerns and my offers to help him and he did not once tell me not to worry.Yesterday I asked him to lend me $20 because a friend invited me somewhere last minute and I didn’t have cash. He got really nervous when I asked him if I could borrow his debit card. He started to act strange. I asked him if he was hiding something from me and he called me crazy and accused me of not believing him. I asked him if he was hiding money from me? And he denied it and said I was paranoid and crazy.He checked his bank account in front of me and acted surprised. He literally shouted, “wow wow wow I have extra money!!!! Oh my god this is so awesome!!” And he played the whole I didn’t know part.He continued to argue and I told him that I don’t care about the money I care about honesty. Why did he lie? and if he can lie so blatantly about this then he can lie (or has lied) about many things.It took a whole day for him to finally confess that he was hiding the money from me because supposedly I was going to ask for some money if I knew. He said he felt guilty for not telling about it when he saw me struggle with money.Today I asked him to leave the house. I called him cruel and deceitful. I told him that I don’t want to be with someone that can lie so blatantly.By the way I’m 6 months pregnant with a very wanted and planned baby. We’ve know each other for 3 years.Am I the as*hole for leaving him over this? I’m just so hurt by how easily he lied and called me crazy and paranoid. And now I’m questioning everything in our relationship. Maybe his gym sessions are time that he spends with women. I don’t know anything anymore.***UPDATE****I followed the advice I received here (thank you). He’s back home but staying in the guest room. He came back with a brand new baby car seat (guilt?) and he’s apologizing profusely. We’ll be taking marriage counseling."
618,Not the A-hole,AITA for walking out after being told one kid was autistic and another kid had a deathly food allergy,19868,lzsbi2,1446,"I (f16) babysit on weekends for some extra money. I used to babysit for this one lady, Diana, and her 2 kids (1f and 4m) every day over the summer while Diana worked. Diana texted me last week and asked if she can give her friend, Jennifer, who has 2 kids (6M and 4F), my number because it was her husband’s birthday and they wanted to go out. I said sure and Jennifer texted me asking about my rates, references, when I was trained in cpr, and a lot of other questions. Ngl it felt kinda weird to me but some people are overprotective so I went with it. Yesterday I got to their house and they left money for us to order food and right before they walked out the door, Jennifer handed me an epipen and said “6M is deathly allergic to peanuts and 4F is autistic and has sensory issues so get her some chicken nuggets.” It took a second for me to process that but I gave back the epipen and said “I’m sorry but I’m not equipped to take care of your kids.” And I left. Well, Jennifer is mad that I “ruined their night” and has been talking shit about me to Diana but once Diana heard the real story she apologized and said she’d talk to Jennifer. AITA for walking out of a babysitting job when I learned one kid has a deathly allergy and the other kid was autisticEdit: I wanted to add that I spent 6 months volunteering in a special needs classroom and I have some health issues so I know how to give shots, although I’ve never used an epipen, so if they would’ve told me before, I probably would’ve taken the job and just watch a few videos on how to use an epipen. I was mostly just in shock and worried that other things would come up too that they didn’t tell me about."
619,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my rich parents that my ‘lower class’ friends and their families are better people than they could ever dream of being?,19844,lyyx2t,1050,"I’ll start by saying that I’m a 17M. Both my parents are very successful lawyers, and we live in a super nice house. They have given me everything I could ask for, but they’re not exactly there for me emotionally. I can’t remember the last time we ate dinner together or had a decent conversation. Most of the time they’re not even home and it’s just me. I feel like a ghost in my own house. We moved to a new town not too long ago, and my parents enrolled me in the more exclusive private school in the area. I’ve gone to private schools my entire life. But my experience at this school was horrible. I’m short, effeminate looking, and obviously gay. The only reason I didn’t get my ass seriously kicked was because my parents are rich. I begged my parents to switch schools, but they were hesitant because the only other option was public schooling. I finally escaped the private school of circle jerking, and enrolled in this new school. I guess I should mention that a few years ago, this school district expanded their enrollment zone to slightly cover a lower income area, which resulted in a handful of students from low income families being enrolled. My first few days at this new school were brutal, with a lot of the same problems following me. Until I ran into Garfield (it’s a family name. I swear he’s not named after a cat). He spoke up and said he would love to be my lab partner when no one else would. We quickly became friends and he introduced me to his childhood friend also attending the school named Eduardo.Since my parents are so distant to begin with, they never noticed me spending so much time with my new friends. Garfield’s mother is a waitress and his dad a construction worker. Eduardo’s mother cleans houses and his dad works odd jobs, such as driving for Uber. Both of their families are amazing and involved. I started dating Garfield and had real friends for the first time ever. Both Garfield and Eduardo have come over to my house about twice and met my parents. The other day, my mother pulled me over and casually mentioned that I was spending a lot of time with that blonde boy (Garfield) and the Hispanic kid. She asked what their families did and where they lived, and I told her. She immediately became upset and said I was aiming way below my abilities and these were not the kind of influences I needed in my life. I asked why, and she said we just live different types of lives and I’ll understand when I’m older. I freaked out and said both of them and their families have been there more for me in the six months I’ve known them than my parents ever have and that they’re cold, unfeeling snobs. My mom started crying and said public school has changed me for the worst. I’ve never seen her cry before, and I’m starting to feel horrible. AITA for saying they’re rich hypocrites and that my friend’s families are better?"
620,Not the A-hole,WIBTA If I(24M) stopped cooking for my (24F) girlfriend?,19796,g9m87x,4125,"I've been with my gf S for 4 years, living together for 2. Off the start of the relationship I knew she was a picky eater. We would go to fancy  restaurants and she would order the simplest things or the same things over and over. It seemed weird to me but I didn't really care,she can do whatever she wants. I only really realized how annoying this is when we moved in together.Now I on the other part I'm the opposite. I like to try new foods, new tastes and get a better idea of food in general. I also love cooking and have a culinary arts degree (I wanted to become a chef but I didn't for other reasons). So you can assume that I do almost all the cooking at home. You can see where this is going.Only when I started cooking for S did I realize how picky of an eater she is. She hates almost everything, even if she can't really taste it in the end product. To give you some examples:She hates cinnamon.She hates garlic.She hates any kind of spice. (clove, nutmeg etc)Yesterday I was making a Spanish omelet and she complained when I added the tiniest pinch of thyme in there. Because of all the ingredients I put in there she is gonna taste the pinch of thyme. I made a white chocolate mousse and she complained when I layerd it with oreos(!) and strawberries, because she apparently doesn't like oreos.No amount of zest can go into our food whether that be orange or lemon zest bacsuse it apparently tastes bitter.She hates spicy food.She only eats steaks or whatever well done. If there's the tiniest amount of pink in there it's raw. (I've destroyed so many good steaks in the past cooking them well done).I could go on about this she doesn't like but we'd be here all day. Last night she asked me to cook dinner but I refused. When she asked why I explained that it's frustrating to cook for a person with the tastebuds of a 5 year old, and that she can order takeout from now on. So reddit WIBTA if I stopped cooking for her?"
621,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting my bf to move in with me?,19784,htyxrw,1936,"UPDATE: Firstly, thank you everyone for your incredibly kind words and messages. Secondly to clarify a couple of things, I never gave him express permission to move in end of july. I had said that I would be excited for him to move in eventually back in May when he first brought it up but that i thought it was too soon, and as he spent more time here over may/june I realised i wasnt happy with how he treated my home as a guest, let alone as a roommate. After my initial excitement I was careful to rebut his suggestion to move in whenever he brought it up because of this. We have now broken up. His mum came round to my condo the other night and basically demanded that I give her a new set of keys(I changed the locks after I told him to get his stuff because he refused to give me his set back). When I refused she made up a bullshit story about how he had left something here and i stupidly let her into my condo. She then went on to ""accidentally"" knock over a vase of flowers, stand on Tiffany, and stood in my lounge/kitchen and called her son telling him to come round asap whilst refusing to leave. I called the cops who arrived shortly before my ex did and escorted her away. I then broke up with my ex through the door because I didn't want to risk letting him into my apartment. Yes there were a lot of red flags but my prior relationship was not a great one at all(can't say why the post will get banned) and I didn't have any other experience  with relationships, so I came into this one with a kinda skewed idea of what was expected in a relationship and just didn't see them until I reread my post from an outsider perspective. For everyone asking, Tiffany(my cat) is fine. She was a rescue, she was a persian/rag doll/unknown cross that was born to a kitten farm and had 4 litters by the time she was two which is when she was uplifted and my mum got her for me. Ive had her for almost 10 years now and shes an absolute princess.~~~So i like my bf but I dont know if this is the right timing for us. We've been together for about 10 months and he has recently started asking to move in with me. My initial reaction was happiness, I was excited to spend more time with him but as he's been staying with me more(3-4 nights per week) there's a few things that have been bothering me. 1. My bf tends to just drop stuff and not pick it up, I have a small condo so piles of clothes and stuff tend to be quite noticeable when there's basically only a handful of surfaces. I have asked him to pick stuff up and he just shrugs it off. 2. He stays up late gaming and refuses to wear headphones so it keeps me up at night(once again its a small condo so hard to get away from noise). He works from 12pm-9pm(4 days a week) so feels like he should be able to enjoy his evenings, but i work from 6am-4pm(5 days a week) and I drive heavy machinery so its important I get enough sleep and im alert enough for work.3. He recently was telling me about how much he was going to save by not paying rent(he currently pays $210/wk), and I questioned why he thought he would be living rent free with me, he argued that he shouldn't have to contribute to my mortgage, and I agreed but said that I would still want about 50% of market rent(market rent is around $220 and i said i would like $100/week, my mortgage payments are $340/week so its not like he's paying half my mortgage). This turned into a rather large argument and he repeatedly slammed doors in my condo and damaged the lock on one. He then got mad when I asked him to help fix it.4. He has repeatedly suggested that if he moved in then my cat would have to be confined to the hall cupboard when he's here because he doesn't like cats(he's not allergic, he just doesn't like them). I disagree and think that's unfair to my 11yo cat who has had the run of the place for the last 4 years.Long story short, my bfs current rental period is up end of July and he has repeatedly talked about moving here rather than finding somewhere else, ive consistently rebutted this but finally put my foot down last weekend after he deliberately let my cat outside and said he absolutely wouldn't be moving in with me and I wanted him to move his gaming stuff out if my lounge/kitchen area. He threw a massive fit and stormed off and now his mum is ringing me and calling me a lot of rather rude things because he's going to have to move back in with them until he finds a new place. AITA for mot letting him move in, even though I was initially keen?Quite a few people have asked our ages, im 24, he's 29."
622,Not the A-hole,AITA for failing a student on the last day of class?,19770,e7fuwh,3198,"FINAL EDIT AT BOTTOM:As a side gig I teach once a week for a local university. The students come to the hospital where I work and I teach them by doing direct patient care. They also have written assignments to complete, some for me in the clinical setting and some in the classroom. Most of the students I have are seniors, so college work is not new to them. This semester I have a student who just has a lack of motivation and puts in little effort. Her assignments are usually submitted late, but there is nothing in the syllabus that states they can’t be turned in late for full credit 🙄 The students are also allowed to redo one failed assignment for full credit. She failed her first assignment and I have reminded her throughout the term that she has to redo it because it’s a required assignment to pass the course. She shows up exactly on time or 2-3 minutes late for class. Their syllabus states that they must be on time for the clinical portion of class (that I teach) or they will be sent home and their absence unexcused. I have not kicked her out when she’s been 2-3 minutes late because it just seems petty. She has also missed a couple of classes that had to be made up with other clinical experiences to get her required hours. I’ve discussed this with her course professor and also with the student in her midterm evaluation. She missed her second to last clinical and I reminded her that she would have to complete that final assignment at her last clinical to pass. She assured me she would. I had a conversation with her classroom professor who has also been frustrated with the student this term. She had just finally turned in an assignment that was 3 weeks late. I was annoyed by that because she ended up getting the same grade as students who completed it on time. Next semester the syllabus will specify points lost for late assignments. This hasn’t historically been an issue. Her course professor had a conversation with her in class last week about her final clinical and that assignment absolutely having to pass or she fails the course. On the last day of clinical, all the students were there, dressed in scrubs, ready for patient rounds, on time. Except this student who walked in 3 minutes late and not dressed. I said “You are late and you are not ready. This is unprofessional. You need to leave immediately.” So, my making her leave means she fails the course because there is no other chance to make it up and it’s final exam week. It also means it delays her graduation by at least one semester because she will have to retake that course and can’t take a course next term that needs this one as a pre-req. At the time I felt very justified in sending her home. She’s been given several warnings and multiple breaks with late work. But now I’m feeling kind of like I might have been an asshole in kicking her out knowing it guaranteed her course failure when I’ve let her stay when she was late in the past. What do you think, Reddit?EDIT:I’ve had a few comments where I’ve addressed this and it should probably be added to the original post. I did discuss her tardiness with her several times. At the beginning of the term she was 2-3 minutes late every day. At first I said “Be careful of your time!” Then a more stern “We start on time, you need to be dressed and ready to go by the start of clinical.” But I was trying not to be a total hard ass over 2 minutes. At midterm I had to do a written evaluation of each student. I put on there that she was often tardy and needed to be on time. Those go in her file. I also filed an Academic Improvement Plan which discussed her tardiness to clinical and those failed assignments. The AIP outlines future expectations which included being on time and turning in assignments. The AIP stays in her file and goes to her academic advisor. At that time I told her she had to be on time and ready for clinical, or the next tine she would be sent home.EDIT 2:Holy cow, I shut my phone off for a couple of hours to go see a movie and this is exploding!! I’m trying really hard to catch up on reading everyone’s comments and answer questions. Bear with me if you posted a question, I’m trying to weave me way through this thread. I’ve seen a few comments and gotten a bunch of dm’s calling me a misogynistic pig. I’m a female. This student being a female had zero to do with my decision. Last term I had a male student who behaved similarly and nearly failed, but finally got his shit together and showed up on time. I don’t care what their gender is, just do your freaking work. And for the people saying I’m TA because why does 2-3 minutes make a difference? You clearly have no idea what rounds are like in a hospital. At the time it begins you have doctors, nurses, residents, students, possibly case managers, social workers, etc, who assemble in a group to present each patient’s case. Every one of them is ready to go. At our hospital, an overhead announcement is made 10 minutes before rounds start so that everyone gets their shit together and is ready. I’ve told my students it’s best to arrive about 10-15 min early so they can be changed in hospital scrubs and in the group ready to go. Nobody is waiting 2-3 minutes for a student to catch up. And you can be damn sure nobody is waiting 10 minutes for a student who came in late and wasn’t dressed.FINAL EDIT: Wow, I really didn’t expect this to garner so many comments! I tried really hard to read all of them and answer the ones asking for more info. I thought it would be easiest to update the most frequently asked questions here. Yes, I did attempt to find out what was going on in her personal life. I’m not an ogre. I wanted to help her and would have been willing to help her in any way I could if she’d given me anything I could work with. Her tardiness was typically the result of staying out too late and sleeping as late as possible. The incomplete and late assignments were the result of failing another course and focusing more on bringing her grade up there. So I tried being flexible on both to keep her sane, which evidently was not what I should have done. She did not fail because she was late for class. She had a required assignment 3 months ago that she failed. She put the redo off for 3 months. The day before her final clinical practicum she was advised that it was her last chance to complete it and that she had to be on time and prepared because she was on a final written warning for tardiness. Her failing grade comes from not completing a required assignment. I do not know if she has ADHD. I will keep that in mind in the future if I see this again. I have requested that the course professor edit the syllabus next term to include a clause for late assignments. It’s not my syllabus to write. I don’t teach in the classroom. Due to a lot of comments I’ve read, I now realize that I need to be more of a hard ass in enforcing attendance rules and wasn’t doing anyone any favors trying to be lenient. So, in the future I will allow the one tardy with a warning. Second time I will send them home. Thank you everyone for your feedback! I really was conflicted over it. I felt like since I have her a final written warning saying her next tardy resulted in her being sent home, she needed to be sent home. I just struggled a bit because of it being her last chance to complete her assignment. But you’ve all made me realize that it was her choice and she was aware of those consequences. I appreciate all of your comments, no matter how you voted. It helped me to look deeper at what I was doing and what I will do in the future."
623,Not the A-hole,AITA for walking out of a job interview?,19735,gqayhg,1308,"Around this time last year, I was in the job hunt and was looking at tech sales positions in my area. I’d been in this career about ten years, and had been recently laid off.I was granted an interview at a relatively large startup downtown, and after the initial phone screen, I did my research and went on site for my in-person interview.Admittedly, I got there about 25 minutes early, which was pushing obnoxious, but nobody was at the front desk. So I signed in using the iPad, took a seat, and waited. I waited until the time of the interview, got up, looked around, and started trying to get the attention of people walking around, as nobody had acknowledged me to this point.At 15 minutes past the interview scheduled time, a lady came into the lobby and asked what I was there for. I let her know I had an interview scheduled for 15 minutes ago. She asked me to hold on and went back into the office, and a few minutes later, came back with an agenda with materials laid out about the company. The agenda confirmed that were were supposed to have already started, and that I had two interviewers in the next two 30-minute blocks.A new person came over and sat me in a room and told me to read over the materials to get familiar. I did this for 45 minutes, and when the VP of sales didn’t show up to interview me, I got pissed, stood up, and left. I found my way to the front desk and told the person who was not there before and had likely no idea who I was that I was ending my interview, and to have a great day.About 15 minutes later, I got a frantic call from the recruiter saying the VP was looking for me and that they wanted to start my interview. I answered that if they weren’t willing to respect my time, then I knew all I needed to know about what working there would be like.I told several folks this story, and it’s been a 50/50 on whether or not I did the right thing, or that I don’t know the circumstances and that I could have stuck around and at least interviewed and let them know later on. AITA?"
624,Not the A-hole,AITA For Refusing To Support My Wife Through Her Diagnosis After Her Infidelity,19720,b6f5fj,2013,"My wife and I had a pretty normal marriage. No kids, both employed and really happy together. For 99% of our relationship we didn't have any major problems, we made time for each other, so on and so forth. She recently went away with her friend for a girls trip. The first two days after she came back everything was fine, and on the third we went to dinner with this friend and her boyfriend. Dinner went well, came home and went to bed. Wife woke me up in the middle of the night crying saying there was something she had to tell me. Long story short, she had cheated on me the entire trip and her friend had cheated on her boyfriend as well, apparently the dinner together caused her to have an attack of conscience because she messaged my wife after I had fallen asleep telling her that she was going to come clean to her partner and my wife had to tell me as well or she would.We talked, yelled, cried. I spent most of the night sick. Told me it was just a horribly stupid decision and was perfectly happy with me (which honestly makes it worse, why risk a happy marriage for an affair), it wasn't my fault, the usual. I've been staying at my sister's place while we figure out the divorce.Before this went down she had been scheduled for tests and scans for what we thought were relatively non-serious health problems. Turns out we were wrong, as I was just contacted last week by her cousin telling me a scan revealed cancer. I got in touch with my wife and we talked, she proved her diagnosis and filled me in on some details. She was understandably terrified and begged me to come back, to talk to her, hug her, give her a chance, to be there with her. I told her I wished her all the best, I'm very sorry for what she's going through and know she's strong enough to make it through but while I'd help financially from a distance, I wasn't physically going back.They (not her) have been harassing me, telling me to man up and go to her. My own friends are split 50/50. I don't want to go back. Before anyone pulls the ""this is probably why she cheated!"" card, no. We had a good marriage, we had a sit-down talk every month to discuss anything wrong. We were solid. She just chose to take a chance on a quick thrill, despite knowing cheating is a 100% dealbreaker for me. She never even planned to tell me until her friend forced her. While I certainly don't think anyone deserves this and I am sorry it happened to her, in my opinion her diagnosis doesn't change our situation. I feel it'll be harder on both of us with me being there knowing I won't forgive her when it's over. It feels like prolonging the inevitable, and I feel like my obligation to her ended when she chose to betray our marriage. She has family and friends so she isn't alone. I care about the woman I thought I married, but I no longer love who she turned out to be, so I feel it'd be unfair to both of us for me to be there. I'm not trying to punish her, my heart just isn't in it anymore. AITA?**Edit**: To the reddit detectives further down. When I said ""we talk every month"" about our problems, it doesn't mean we only talk once a month in strict time slots. We talked as often as needed, but made a point at least once a month to sit with each other and check in, see how we're feeling and so on. Secondly, I mentioned she proved her diagnosis because when I was told I didn't believe it, I figured it was a ploy to get me to come over and talk because she and her family had been trying to get me to reconsider from the moment I left. I also didn't want numerous answers to be filled with that exact same speculation. As far how she cheated the ""entire"" trip, the two of them went with the purpose of meeting up with two specific people her friend knew. And I figured this would be easy to figure out but I guess not, I knew her friend forced her to tell me because I demanded to see their messages after she told me she cheated. Finally, I know a lot of people post made up stories. I'm not one of those people, but short of providing personal details I can't prove it. If I wanted karma I wouldn't be on a throwaway, I posted here because when some of your own friends are telling you that you're unreasonable I think it's time for neutral third party judgement and I was hoping for valuable insight, which many people provided. To the mods, I'm sorry this post wasn't a great fit here. I'll post in the appropriate subs in the future."
625,Not the A-hole,AITA for not joining in on my town’s search party for a missing 18 year old girl even though it got me a school suspension?,19721,kufl2k,1130,"I used to be very close friends with this girl, we’re more of acquaintances now but we still stay in touch sometimes. Her mom reported her as a missing person all over town and on the town’s community pages of Facebook, the police post included that she’s not been seen since she left voluntarily from her mother’s residence. I texted her asking if she’s seen the news, and apparently she hasn’t. I told her about how she’s been reported as a missing person and that everyone is looking for you. She said that she cut contact with her mom and has her own apartment now, and that she made it clear to her mom that she was leaving. I told her that we should let the police know that you’re safe so they can call off the search.The next day or so after getting that information from my friend, we went to the police station to call off the search party since it was a mistake that she was missing. She explained to them about how she moved away from her mom so she was never actually missing.Later that day I saw some update posts from the police on Facebook and some other posts that she was discovered to be safe and that there was some confusion about whether she was actually missing or not. Well, people in the comments got upset that she wasn’t brought back home to her mom, so now they’re all doing their own individual search party to look for this 18 year old girl. I told everyone in the comments that I know her and that she made it clear to her mom that she was moving out, and that I saw her at her apartment the other day perfectly fine. Then I got a bunch of comments coming back at me saying I should be ashamed of myself and that a child her age is not capable of being out on their own and that I should give them her apartment address. What are they gonna do, break down her door? Even at school staff have been saying things to me here and there about how I should knock some sense into my friend (my friend and I are still in high school), I think it’s weird they’re all talking to me behind her back as if she doesn’t know what she’s doing. And then another thing is that her mom posted a comment under the police report saying “Just to give some advice to parents out there- please, please, please keep some sort of tracking device on your kids’ phones that will track them even if the phone is turned off. I wish to God I would’ve done one on ____”, even though her daughter left willingly. I told everyone that but I got more replies of “You don’t know if she really did, someone could’ve influenced her to leave her mom”.It gets worse, I got an in-school suspension (a suspension that lasts 2-3 days but I stay in a Reflection room all day long) because I was “helping/encouraging” a runaway. How does that even relate to what I do in school? Her being away from home doesn’t have anything to do with me other than I’m friends with her and know about her situation and respect her decisions. I’m still not going to give anything up because I believe I’m not in the wrong here but now everyone is against me. They’re not being helpful either because the school principals keep pulling her out of class to talk to her.*** Because a lot of people asked I live in the US."
626,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting to leave my own apartment?,19716,ldaeo0,1588,"I'll keep this vague to avoid recognition since I'm believe the parts involved actually use reddit.I'm a 28 year old male, and I've been friends with my roommate, a 25 female, ever since we were babies. Our families were neighbors and we grew up together. She's like a little sister to me and has always been.After she graduated college she moved to the same city I currently work in, and since she couldn't find an apartment close enough to where she worked I told her she could live with me. We'd share bills and become roommates.We never really had problems or fights as we known each other for so long. However, recently, things taken a strange turn. She got involved with someone from her work.The guy seemed to be a nice guy. I only ever spoken to him three times as they usually keep to her room. But he was very friendly and honestly I was happy she found someone who seemed that nice.After a few months of their relationship, she sent me a text saying she needed to talk with me. I figured there might be something wrong with the apartment. It's not uncommon for things to break.But I was wrong. When I got home we started to talking. It's too long to write everything, so I'll just summarize.She told me that while she enjoyed living with me, her boyfriend was starting to get jealous of his woman living with another man. At first I raised an eyebrow but thought that this kind of thing isn't uncommon. So I was like ""Oh, it's fine. Just let me know when you plan on leaving, hope you two find a good place!"".However, apparently I was wrong. She told me that she wasn't leaving. She said that it was impossible to find someone closer to her work and that she was hoping I would let her take the apartment instead, since my work wasn't close and all that.Thing is, I really love my place. It's close to the gym, to the grocery store, to pretty much everything. I'm not gonna just leave my place because of something so stupid as this, and I told that flat out that it wasn't going to happen.She got visibly upset and started to rant about me being and egoistical asshole. That I didn't have empathy to put myself in her shoes. This happened a few days ago, and she's shut herself in her room only ever leaving to go to work or to pick up her boyfriend, who became really unfriendly to me after that.Now, usually, I can be an asshole. But I don't think this was one of these times. So I thought I would ask for reddits verdict.Am I really such an asshole?  Edit: I didn't expect this to get this much attention. For those who have asked, her name isn't on the lease as I lived in the same place for two years before she moved in."
627,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my friend that he is basically an employee of his dad and not a business owner like he says he is?,19680,jqc6k0,739,"My friend J comes from a wealthy family as his dad owns several successful businesses. He’s not a snob, but recently he’s become a bit preachy about how it’s better to be an entrepreneur than an employee. We’ve talked about it several times before. I’ve been working for a financial company for 9 years, and he always asks me about when I would put up my own business. I told him that I enjoy my current job because I get paid alright, have a great time with my coworkers and learn many things from my clients. J said that I’m wasting my time working for a company that pays me so little compared to what I could earn if were a business owner. I told him that I do have plans of having my own business someday, but that requires a large amount of capital and is a huge risk that I’m not yet comfortable taking. He said that I’ve been an employee for 9 years, so “If not now, when?” and that you can only get the reward if you take the risk. I usually try to brush things off because I know that J has good intentions, he’s just a little out of touch with how hard it can be to put up your own business and be successful at it, since his dad’s businesses have been there all his life. But the other day he was telling me about one of his cousins who asked for advice on college majors. He told me that he told his cousin to go for a business degree, work for two years to get some experience and then have his own business, just like J said he did. He also told his cousin to remember to aspire for greater things and not be satisfied with being an employee forever.I was a bit irked about the last part and told him that hey, there’s nothing wrong with being an employee ‘forever’ and not everyone is cut to or wants to be a business owner. He said yes, there’s nothing wrong with being an employee forever, but if you’re smart or have any ambition, you would want to have your own business instead of working for someone else your whole life.I told J that if he thinks that being a business owner is the best way to succeed financially, then why hasn’t he put up his own business? He said that he does have his own business, referring to the construction firm his dad founded which he now manages, and he doesn’t have to put up a new one since his family already has one in place. I asked how it’s his if he isn’t the registered owner, needs approval from his dad for all major decisions, and doesn’t control the company’s income. I said that he’s basically an employee who happens to be related to the owner and the monthly allowance he gets for running the business is his salary.He didn’t reply to me after that and hasn’t talked to me since.

629,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my GF I saw her daughter's butthole?,19650,lw8jnz,2369,"I (44m) started dating a woman (45f) back in December. Her daughter (20f) moved down in January from out of state and is staying with my GF until she gets settled. Daughter is a good kid, we get along well, she even gets along with my son (13m).A few weeks ago the daughter asked if she could use Snapchat to send me videos of the painting they’re doing in the house, videos of the their dogs etc. Week before last my girlfriend mentions a picture of one of the dogs that her daughter posted on Instagram. Knowing that many people use the same username across multiple platforms I did a Google search using her snapchat username. The first result was Twitter which I skipped because Twitter, 2nd result was her reddit profile. I think oh cool, I love reddit, (just got my 6 year badge) and click the link to her profile. Turns out she uses reddit to post pics for her OnlyFans page… I see a thumbnail of what could only be described as a picture used for a tele-health exam with an OBGYM and/or Proctologist. I closed the page and went back to the Google search results and read the summaries on the links instead of just looking at the domain like I was before. All of the links were related to her OF content mixed with her personal info. Anyone who has been on the net for a while knows this is a recipe for disaster. Hell, I’m even using a throwaway for this post and it doesn’t have a pic of my butthole in it, I just don’t want this story associated with my main profile.I talked to a few of my female friends who have daughters to see how bad it would be if I tell my GF what happened. It’s not like there’s advice for this topic on r/datingoverforty. The general consensus was I needed to tell my GF due to the safety risk. Last week I told my GF and showed her how to search her daughter’s username because my GF is not tech savvy at all. I showed her how it only took 4 steps to go from her daughter’s OnlyFans page to the location sharing of Snapchat and see her house. I told her I’m not condoning what she’s doing but if she’s going to do it then she needs to be more careful. My GF told her daughter to Google her OF name and it of course returned a lot of stuff and the daughter freaked out. She put 2 and 2 together knowing her mom isn’t savvy enough to figure this out on her own and texted me about finding it. I admitted to her how it all went down sans the details of the picture. Daughter accuses me of stalking her and looking for her nudes because I must be a perv. I explained I didn’t go looking for them, it’s not like I subscribed to her OF page. But told her if it was that easy for me to find the pictures then it would be just as easy for a stranger to find her IRL. Like I told my GF, it’s one thing to show your bits online for strangers, it’s another thing when they knock on your door.So now daughter thinks I’m a creep that went looking for her nudes, my GF isn’t talking to me, and I need to know if ITA here for telling my GF?Thank you"
630,Not the A-hole,AITA for forcing my son to see how difficult it is to raise a baby?,19648,ca83jg,3055,"My son sat me and his mother down last week and told us he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. He is only 17 and she is 16. I told him I was proud that he came forward to tell me, but I didn't get too far into the discussion before he told me that they are keeping the baby. Both have not graduated high school, and frankly, both are quite irresponsible. According to him, having a child is ""easy"" and not ""really that hard"". We tried to persuade him to look at other options, but he was adamant that they were going to have the kid and that was the end of that.Since then, the house has been quite tense. Any talk of the situation is immediately shut-down and my son refuses to see what we are attempting to show him. I have decided to teach him that kids are more difficult then he initially thinks. Since my son told us they were pregnant, I have done the following:1. I wake him up twice a night, 2 hours apart after he has fallen asleep. I open the door, scream as loud as I can until I know he is awake, and I shut the door. I've done this 5 nights in a row.2. I purchased a sack of flour for him and dressed it in a diaper. I have made him change the diaper every 2 hours, and if he doesn't, I shut off the internet until he changes it. I will sometimes smear nutella in the diaper for added effect/mess.3. While playing one of his games, I told him his ""baby"" wanted to be held. Giving me a truly shit-eating grin, he told me he has no issue playing his game and holding the baby. I placed the sack of flour in his arms and he continued to play basically one handed. While he was doing this, I went to the kitchen, grabbed a small cup of applesauce and splashed it on his shoulder while he was playing. I told him that his baby spit up and he might want to pause his game to take care of that.4. I have not allowed him to go to the movies or hang out with his friends at their house. When he presses me for a reason, I tell him ""You dont have a babysitter. You can go if you take your sack of flour with you."" He has not gone anywhere in a week.5. Yesterday, I did my best pratfall in front of his friends who were over and then wailed and cried until he came over and started talking to me. I told him babies demand attention, and he will have to get used to this. This was the last straw for him.After his friends left, he accused me of being an asshole and for being ridiculous with the wants and needs of a baby. He told me I am being completely unrealistic. I reminded him that he himself was an incredibly fussy baby, and everything I have done so far he has done to me in the past.His mother tells me I am being an asshole and to let him make his own decisions, but I don't want my 17 year shackled to a baby when neither of them are ready for this. If anything, I want him to realize how hard this is going to be, and to at least look at options.Tell me the truth Am I being too much of an asshole here?"
631,Not the A-hole,"AITA for sending my kid to school with ""adult"" snacks and lunches?",19636,b2za6i,3179,"Living a healthy lifestyle is important to me, and it's important to pass it onto my kids as well. I have a second grader who I have brought up (so far) to be very involved in the kitchen, what we eat, diet and exercise. She came home with a note from her teacher the other day asking to please send her with more ""appropriate"" snacks and lunches. I thought for a minute that maybe I accidentally grabbed one of my Quest Bars or something for her and asked my daughter.For her morning snack, all the other kids had something like cookies, fruit by the foot/gummy snacks, etc. My daughter's absolute favorite snack ever is pickles, and she has said herself that she's never that hungry at snack time because we have a nice high protein breakfast, I put in a cut up pickle for her along with a babybel cheese in case she *was* hungry. The teacher commented on it.Lunchtime came around, and I guess a similar thing happened. My kid goes nuts for anything spicy, so for lunches this week I made a cold spicy sesame noodle dish with lots of peanuts, shaved carrots, etc. Her friend wanted to sample it so she gave some to her friend, and I guess it was crazy spicy for the friend and she cried to the teacher. This is what sparked the note. So I explained that she shouldn't share ""spicy"" foods with her friends, and figured I'd skip the pickles next time. Well, it wasn't good enough. Just yesterday, the teacher sent home a letter to everyone explaining that she's requesting we make sure to send ""age appropriate"" foods to school, and gave examples of things like a PB & J, snack pack pudding, fruit cups, etc.I called the teacher and asked her about the note. Teacher became very judgmental and said to please just remember my daughter is ""a little kid"" and that she doesn't need to worry about eating ""adult food"" yet. I asked if there was some kind of school policy about this, and she became very icy and said ""No"" and ""This really shouldn't be a big deal.""This might be where I fucked up. I told the teacher that I'm the parent, and there's nothing wrong with my child's diet. That when she (the teacher) has kids, she can feed what she might she'd like, but that unless there's some kind of school policy, I will continue to send my kid to school with the foods I pick. Teacher got huffy and hung up. Just to double check, I asked my daughter two things: Does she LIKE her lunches? (Enthusiastic yes about most of them!) and ""Are the other kids making fun of you?"" because I know that can be an issue. She said no, and that sometimes they even ask for a pickle too. So AITA, or is this teacher way out of line?"
632,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling a deaf kid's mom that she's holding her son back?,19609,jj1ms4,1015,"My Jack (10) is very quiet, he likes to read, he likes the quiet, he likes bright visuals and museums, he didn't speak for a long time, he loves to learn, and he's got a tiny group of friends but he's happy and always looking for more. Jack is autistic and doesn't like much noise. Jack met James at the playground we go to.  James is deaf and he's got a serious case of helicopter mom, they waved and talked and ran around before we left and we've been almost every day since and they've seen each other. Because James is deaf and isn't extremely loud and understands that about Jack, they've become very good friends. Jack came to the conclusion that James can read and write like him and so he got a little pen and notebook and he had me put him on YouTube so that he could try and learn some sign language (friend, play, run, would you like to go with me to..., hello!, and other friendly things). And now they're best friends. Jack recently had the idea that because James can't hear, they have to do things with seeing, we live near a big and beautiful aquarium and Jack had the idea that we could all go together (me and my husband would be with James' parents) and they could be actual friends outside of the playground setting. I approached James' mother to ask them yesterday and she informed me that she didn't want the boys to get to close because James is deaf and they don't want him to make too many friends that aren't because he's already at a disadvantage and she doesn't want him to be left out. I informed her that if her son would be going to public school and entering the world, he'd have to get used to being deaf and having all sorts of friends and all she was doing was pushing away the friends that he could be making and being selfish while not looking after what her son wanted. I don't know what happened exactly but I got a call last night from James' father with James SCREAMING in the background and everything has been set up, we're going with him and his wife (step-mom) on Friday and calling it a day. We'll all wear masks and have a nice outing and it's all completely fine. The boys are both extremely excited to go together. I saw his mom at the playground this morning and she was quite aggressive, telling me I should've never set up the play date and involving her ex husband, I told her that if she only thought of her feelings, there was a reason her son had had to go to his dad to be able to see his friend, and I walked away from her. AITA?"
633,Not the A-hole,AITA for removing the stereo faceplate from my car before a long (3+ hours) drive because my GF wouldn't stop muting it to take/make phone calls?,19594,d5iwaj,2086,"To preface this i think i might have overreacted because honestly? i can't stand driving. i hate it. but i gotta get places and where i live that means driving.Little bit of info first, my car is an older car with the stereo that you can change the faceplate, like the buttons and stuff. a few years ago i sent it to a mechanic friend for a tune-up and he put bluetooth in it as a gift.I occasionally(usually averages out to once or twice every 2-3 months) have to drive several hours to see a specialist for a medical condition I've had since i was born. over the last year or so my GF(R) has started to come with me, which i appreciate very much because i know hospitals bring back a lot of not-good memories for her.For the Issue at hand. R is very much a social butterfly and loves to talk on the phone. whenever she gets a call she'll reach over and turn the volume all the way down or mute it, not even pausing my music/podcast or whatever. it's an almost unconscious action. if i try to turn it back up, my hand either gets swatted away or i get told ""this is important"", or ""i need to hear this"". if this was once or twice during a drive it's whatever i don't care that much. but if it's a 3 hour drive, she's on the phone with friends or doing errands over the phone for at least half of it. we've had multiple talks about it, but she just either brushes me off or insists she's not on the phone for that long.it drives me up a wall, i hate sitting in traffic listening to half a conversation that doesn't have anything to do with me, for hours. so this time before we left, i connected my bluetooth to the car and then took the faceplate off so the only way you could control it was though my phone, which was in my pocket.she's pretty mad, not about that music, but that she felt i was treating her like a teenager and punishing her. i felt that it wasn't about punishing her, but just actually being able to listen to my podcast without being unreasonably interrupted.Edit: to answer some FAQs, She doesn't drive, never has. we both live in the city and it wasn't necessary for her because she either walks or bikes to work. the hospital is in the next city over.i always run the podcast(if that's the plan sometimes just music.) by her the night before or that morning because i download it to not use any data, we both like crime shows and stand-up podcasts so it's usually in that vein, Dr death, YMH, bill burr, court junkies, stuff like that. I love to talk to her, and am more than happy to pause anything for conversation, but if she's on the phone i would at least like to be able to listen to something i enjoy also. turn it down, by all means, just not off. and if you have to turn it off, at least pause it so i don't have to play catch-up 20 minutes later when I'm allowed to listen againi can't use headphones, it's illegal to do that and drive where i am. she doesn't like to take phonecalls with headphones, which i can't really blame her for, because i don't like to either.I've brought this up both immediately before and after drives, and the response is either a promise not to touch the volume when she's on the phone that gets broken after 20 mins or platitudes that's she's not on she's not on the phone for THAT long. if i ask her to check the timecodes of a call or how many she thought she made she gets extremely defensive and just accuses me of trying to start an argument. I never asked her to come on these routine trips so i try to just let it go when we get there and just enjoy her being there with me. i have asked her to come on more serious appointments, where surgery is involved or i stay overnight. but even during a routine trip i try plan something to do so the whole day isn't wasted, a nice or famous restaurant or something.after thinking about it and how I felt for the last few hours i really think she's in denial about how long she's on the phone, and I feel slighted and angry because i feel like i need her permission to listen to the stereo in my car. I'll talk to her more when she gets home, if we've both cooled off enough."
634,Not the A-hole,AITA for making my pregnant SIL sleep on an air mattress?,19577,e106s0,4326,"My partner and I bought a house this summer, and for Thanksgiving we’re hosting my parents-in-law, my sister-in-law (SIL), and her husband. SIL is due with her first baby at the end of February.The plan is to have parents (in their late 60’s) sleep in our guest bedroom on a proper frame and mattress. That leaves our office, with an air mattress (a decent one, but still) for SIL and her husband. Last time SIL visited overnight a few months ago, we had other guests already staying in the guest bedroom for several weeks and felt it would be a lot to have them move all their personal items, so we gave her the air mattress again.  She made a big deal about how pregnant people should get priority sleeping arrangements, even if it means uprooting someone for a night. She recently mentioned to my partner that maybe she and her husband should take our master bedroom when they come in a few days for the holiday.I’ve never been pregnant, and I can respect that maybe you just want some damn comfort as you grow a human. However, I think my judgment may be clouded by my annoyance that she historically makes a stink about getting what she wants, pregnant or not. Further, I currently live long-distance from my partner, and I am only home for the week. I just want to enjoy the visit, appreciate the home we’ve bought AND sleep in my master bedroom, dammit. AITA?EDIT: Thanks for all of your suggestions and reality checks. I really liked the suggestion from /u/lizard_windowpane to leave it to the in-laws in a group chat to determine who sleeps where. Realistically, it feels a bit late in the game to insinuate via text that SIL would be better off not showing up, so my partner and I have decided to put our nice comfy mattress into the office for SIL and rock out on the air mattress in our room for the visit. Is it a perfect solution? No, but SIL and elder in-laws get much-needed comfort, we keep our room. Hopefully next year, we’ll just be guests!"
635,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I didn’t give up MY honey moon villa to my grandparents?,19571,ci22ko,3076,"My family is Asian, my husbands side is white.My husband and I got married and are treating his side of the family, and my side to a 1 week all expense paid vacation to bora bora as a pre family honeymoon before going off on our “real” one. We were able to rent out half a side of the bungalows and only one villa was in that section. My husband and I took the villa.The bungalows are a 1000 sq feet 1 bedroom(option of 1 king bed or 2 queens), 1 bathroom, and out door space type of deal. We made sure everyone was accommodated for and everyone had a comfortable living situation. Our villa is a 4000 sq ft 1 bedroom, 1 bath including sauna, living room, a grand out door space, with an outdoor bath tub, pool and slide to get in the ocean. We have not even made it a whole 24 hours here yet and a fight has already broken out. During dinner, my cousin mentioned wanting to come over and use our slide. My grandparents asked what we were talking about and asked to see pictures of our room. Well, they saw my villa and demanded that we trade rooms with them as no elders should made to “slave” and live as “peasants” while their grandchildren get a nicer room. This is bora bora we’re talking about. No one is living as a peasant here. There was only 1 villa available in our section. Had I given it to my grandparents I think it would’ve been offensive to my husbands grandparents. If there was 3, we would’ve given it to both grandparents and 1 for ourself. But unfortunately, there wasn’t. I mentioned this and they still demanded the villa.I obviously objected, and said I felt as though my husband and I should have that room as this is a vacation with family to celebrate OUR marriage, plus we paid for this entire trip? Wouldn’t one just sit back and be grateful they’re on a free vacation instead of complaining?My grandparents freaked out. Saying I’m holding money above their head and that I’m being disrespectful and not following their orders. They stormed off after threatening to take the first flight out tomorrow morning and leaving. Idk what to do. My side of the family is telling me to just give them the room to be respectful and bring peace to the family, while my husbands side thinks my grandparents are bat shit crazy and I agree. They are so ridiculous. All I wanted was both sides of the family to get together and get to know each other and now it’s falling apart. I don’t think I’m the asshole at all, but I’ve been up all night thinking wether I should just squash it and invite my grandparents to stay in my villa in order for them not to leave. But another part of me just wants to tell them to go fuck themselves for making my honey moon about themselves, just like they do with everything else. So Reddit, what do I do? WIBTA if I denied giving up my villa?***UPDATE***Even though I really wanted to be petty and tell them to fuck off, I decided it’d be better to kill them with kindness so they have little to work with if they decide to spin it around that I was disrespectful.During breakfast my grandparents refused to show up if I was there. Everyone tried calling them-nope we’re not coming cause disrespectful granddaughter is there. After a lot of persuading and even having to send our baby cousin to their room to soften them up, they finally decided to come. I made the first conversation by asking if they looked at any flights to leave yet, they could forward the paystub to my cell. They said they hadn’t looked yet and that should be my job if I was kicking them out?? I made sure they knew I was not kicking them out, but understood if they wanted to leave and offered to send some staff to their room to pack up their belongings so they could have a little more time to explore, or get their complimentary in room massage that comes with all the bungalows. They kind of stopped eating and looked at each other in shock. Every time they threaten not to go anywhere, my family has always babied them and begged them not to leave and offer money or extravagant gifts for them to stay. Well, I’m not doing that. I’ll pay for their flight back home, but I’ve already done enough accommodating on MY honeymoon vacation. So there you have it. My grandparents weren’t even planning to go home, they tried scaring me into begging them to stay. I called their bluff. After breakfast, I found a flight leaving around 5pm and walked to the main desk to ask them to cancel reservations for that room for the rest of the trip and to send staff to help pack. They also didn’t get their complimentary massage because the resort only offers that on 4 night stays or longer. Staff came to help pack, and they left half an hour ago. Im currently in my villa de stressing before dinner and some uncles came in(who were married into family) and confided in me that they were sick and tired of the entitlement my grandparents have had since day 1 and they were glad someone born into the family decided to speak up. My cousins came over and honestly couldn’t care less my grandparents are gone, in their words “they kill the vibe”. So everyone’s happy right now and is using my slide before cleaning up for dinner. I’m happy I was able to stand up to my grandparents without being blatantly disrespectful. I have an overflow of messages and comments, that I can’t get back to. However, the main question is what my profession is. I did not go the usual Asian route. I actually dropped out my last year of college and started a fashion line that took a couple years to take off, but surprisingly sky rocketed a few years ago. My dad is also an entrepreneur, I looked up to him and am so glad I had him as an inspiration who paved the way. Don’t give up on your dreams."
636,Not the A-hole,AITA for hiding my finances from future MIL,19573,hiw0ot,1045,"I recently got engaged to my boyfriend of 3 years. For background, he’s an oncologist, his parents divorced when he was 5, MIL never remarried or had more kids but FIL did and so Fiancé has a younger half-brother and a step mom. I have a BA and MBA from decent schools, but I quit my conventional office job to be a yoga teacher and eventually opened my own yoga studio.  MIL was not outwardly hostile towards me, more like polite but very cold. She told Fiancé it was because a yoga teacher wasn’t good enough for him. Why couldn’t he find a nice “lady doctor” or nurse at work, etc. Fiancé told me this because we don’t keep secrets but I never mentioned it to MIL, I just stopped trying so hard. She would periodically warn fiancé I was out for his money, because he’s a doctor, he needs someone “on the same level.” What MIL did not learn until after we were engaged is that, through my grandfather, I have a substantial trust fund. I have zero student loans, a paid off home, car, and own my studio with no debt. I keep this information private from most people because I don’t want to be judged for it. I didn’t tell fiancé until about 15 months into our relationship. When we got engaged she was telling fiancé he needs a pre-nup and that’s when he told her about my finances. She lost her mind. Told him he and I should not have withheld that information, we were disrespectful, deceitful, manipulative, etc. She then started trying to act like my best friend. I maintained a polite distance. She asked fiancé why and he told her that I knew he didn’t like me because a “yoga teacher isn’t good enough.” Y’all, she turned on the waterworks, tears, sobs, said he should not have told me and that he ruined her relationship with her future DIL. I think she’s full of it. His father and step-mom have been kind, accepting, warm and loving to me since the day we met. It didn’t matter that I’m just a yoga teacher. His mother insists I and my fiancé are cruel and deceitful. I think people like her are the reason I am right to hide my financial situation. Fiancé thinks we should apologize just to smooth things over and clean the slate. I have no interest in doing so. AITA?Edit: For those asking - My Fiancé would defend me when she insulted me. She did know I owned the studio but assumed that I financed with loans. He did not have my explicit permission to share my finances with her but was so sick of her harping about a pre-nup he “wanted to shut her up.” As for all the advice about the pre-nup - that was always the plan, which my fiancé is obviously fine with. She’s probably going to lose her mind. I’ve poked around on JNMIL and I think my fiancé is what is people refer to as a “surrogate spouse” to his mother. Another incident comes to mind where she started crying when he wanted to spend his birthday dinner on the day of his birthday with me instead of her and offered her the day before or after. That’s clearly not healthy."
637,Not the A-hole,AITA for not giving up my room because my half sister wanted it as a “christmas gift”,19566,klog6j,1904,"I (F16) live with my mom and her husband. My mom and dad divorced when i was 2 and she and her husband had another kid, my half sister (14). I visit my dad here and there but not often due to him traveling a lot for work. Recently i’ve grown into liking anime and other things so i asked my mom if i could rearrange my room. It was super plain and depressing at first so it felt good to add color and lots of decorations (posters, led lights, pictures)It took nearly 3 weeks but it came out super nice and it overall makes me a lot happier to be in. Last week, my half sister went into my room while i was visiting my dad to celebrate Christmas early and she told her dad she wanted my room because it looked nice to her. When i came home my mom told me about her wanting my room and i said no. She said it would mean a lot to my half sister and i could take her room and redecorate that one. I said no again and that if she really wanted a room like mine she could decorate her own herself with their help. My mom said she was just a kid and wouldn’t be able to do all the decorations like i did and it would be simple if i just redecorated the other room. I was angry my mom would even suggest i give up my room i worked hard for and even spent my own money on everything but the paint. Her husband offered to give me money to decorate the other room without spending my money but i still declined. My mom called me a brat and said i was almost 17 and should grow up, that i wouldn’t be in the room anymore than another 2 years so it wasn’t a big deal to give it up. Her husband called me selfish and said i was crushing his daughter’s feelings and that was the only thing she wanted for Christmas. His words were “OP, how could you crush your little sister’s dreams and be so selfish”. I get it’s just a room but i still don’t think it’s right that i have to give up something i worked hard for because she went into my room without my permission, something they didn’t even care to acknowledge. My mom has been trying to convince me to give her the room and i said if she takes my room then i’ll remove all the decorations. She has been mad at me for nearly 3 days now i feel like an awful person for letting it get to this extent AITA?Editing to add: My sister isn’t  willing to decorate her room with me. I’ve offered and she said no. She just wants my room for idk what reason. And i refuse to decorate her entire room by myself.Edit: THANK YOU to everyone who messaged me and commented you guys are all too kind. I’ve tried all day to get my sister to agree to decorating her own room but she doesn’t want to. She’s been making a lot of comments hinting that she would just take my room when i go visit my dad again. So i talked to my dad about the whole situation and he sided with me and said i wasn’t obligated to give up my room.  I told my mom even my dad agreed and she still doesn’t care. A lot of you are right this isn’t the first thing my sister wanted (and got to have in those cases). I have a really good relationship with my dad and where i live, i’m old enough to stay at home alone while my dad is gone. A really really nice person messaged me and suggested i go live with my dad and when he comes home next week i’ll talk to him about it then.If people can stop dm’ing me asking to post my story that would be great! I don’t want my mom to happen to come across it somehow or my sister to see it. Please don’t post it EDIT/ Hey, I just wanna let you all know, i did it! I moved in with my dad and i took every last decoration down the only thing that stayed was the painted walls. My mom wasnt happy, she kind of blamed me for everything? She said i was overreacting over a room and by me leaving i was being a child. Thank you to the kind redditors who messaged me and has kept in touch since you guys are the reason i even had the courage to stand up for myself for once. My dad is a freakin amazing guy and he let me decorate my room with a lot more decorations!! Words cant explain how thankful i am to all of you, you guys are awesome!"
638,Not the A-hole,AITAH for letting my coworkers quit because I got fired?,19569,drw1sf,1327,"A regular offered me $100 to take a shot with him, he has been drinking at the bar I worked at for over 10 years, I worked there for 4 years. I made a shot with sour mix and cranberry to match the color of his so he thought I was taking one. I just want to make extra money.My manager happened to see this on the cameras. There is a strict no drinking policy at this bar for bartenders on the clock, and it’s a new manager who is trying to show her authority so she made an example of me and fired me.There is no way to prove there wasn’t booze in my shot, I saw the footage and with the liquor gun we have right next to the pop gun there is no way to prove I didn’t put liquor in that shot.I honestly don’t and didn’t care enough to argue with her about it. I’m about to start a new job since I graduate from school after this semester and am not to concerned about my future in bartending.I trained basically every new person at this bar, and I was honest with them that I was fired in our work group chat. They all started saying if you got fired for that we don’t want to work here either. They were all saying bad things about the manager and how they want to screw the whole bar over by all quitting at the same time.I told them that our new manager is balls to the walls. I said I’m going to be just fine, but not to make my same mistake and drink ANYTHING out of a shot glass because she is that concerned about it. I also told them to think for themselves and do whatever they need to when it comes to their jobs.I then let my anger overtake me and I said “if you want to find a job where you don’t have to be constantly looking over your back and have to be worried about an insane manager find different bartending and serving jobs. You’re all capable people that don’t deserve a psycho watching over you when you’ve put good time into a work place.” I basically contradicted myself. I feel like I went over the top, my sister said I should’ve kept my mouth shut. But I explained the whole situation to the old manager, who taught me the “mix things together to look like booze so people don’t feel rejected when they buy you shots trick”. She thinks it’s crazy the new manager won’t trust me after training so many people in and my old manager loves me.My old manager quit because she was moving away with her fiancé, but she told the new manager that I was trustworthy and I thought the new manager would have some trust considering I was basically running the bar when she came in. Whatever the case, AITAH for letting a lot of employees quit on my behalf? Because as of now 7/10 bartenders where I was fired from are planning a group quit. I don’t want the bar to close, but I want my manager to realize that she messed up..."
639,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my sister and bil sleep in my room instead of the living room?,19540,gkfn66,1583,"My sister, bil, and their son moved in with me for due to financial issues. They have been here for around a month now.I only have a two bedroom place though. So my sister and bil have been bunking down in our living room and their son is staying in my sons room.They’ve asked if we could change the sleeping arrangements, so they (sister and bil) get one of the bedrooms and the boys stay in the living room. She said she and her husband were having problems because they never have any privacy for just the two of them. I said no to that because my son (who is autistic) needs to keep his sleeping arrangements and space the same otherwise he will have a meltdown and I’ll have a hard time getting him to bed.  My sister understood that and then asked if I could stay in the living room then. She thinks it makes more sense for the single person to sleep in the living room instead of the couple who could share a bed. And yeah, from a neutral point of view it makes more sense, but come one this is my home. I want to keep my private area to myself in my home. It’s already driving me crazy having them here all the time. It’s only going to be worse if I don’t have someplace to retreat to. I also don’t want to have to sleep on a couch or air mattress in my home. I want to sleep in my bed where I won’t wake up with a backache.Also let’s be real I don’t want my sister having sex in my bed. If I had a guest room I wouldn’t care, but them being in my own personal bed just makes me uncomfortable. Like I totally get that not having privacy and not being able to have sex sucks for them, but I don’t think that that should effect me.So, I told her no to that too and now my sister and bil are basically giving me the silent treatment. They’re also both getting snippy with each other and arguing in hushed tones."
640,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting to help my classmate after she outed my husband?,19541,j8nzr8,1926,"My husband, ""Adam"" is transgender and takes testosterone. He orders it online to arrive at a pharmacy. I decided to go back to school and get my degree (I'm 28f) last year, and there's a pharmacy on campus, so we agreed that he'd get his meds shipped there and I'd pick it up for him from now on.Early this year (January/February sort of time) I picked up Adam's gel. My classmate, ""Jess"", saw me leave with a medication bag, and asked if I was okay, and I said it was for Adam. She then asked if he was okay, and I said he was. She asked me what I'd gotten him. I found this to be more than a little invasive, so I said it was private. After a few seconds she asked why I was getting him testosterone, which she'd managed to read off the label on the bag. (EDIT: To be clear, she doesn't work there, she saw me leaving then started walking with me to class)I couldn't think of an excuse so I just told her the truth: my husband is trans, he's trying to be discreet about it, please don't tell anyone. She agreed and off she went. Within a few hours, everyone knew and I was on the receiving end of questions from several classmates about how my husband and I have sex and various other disgusting advances. They all said Jess had told them. At the end of the day Adam picked me up and people were ogling us, and he knew that they knew before I even said anything and he was crushed.About 8 months later, present day, Jess then caught the illness I don't know if I'm allowed to name. She's missed basically the whole first month of classes, and will probably miss future ones, too. I make recordings of the lectures that I am willing to share with anyone who asks. She wants my recordings. She asked me for the recordings privately 6 separate times in the span of 3 days, and the first 5 times I said I'd let her know. The 6th was the final straw for me and I told her to piss off. Last night she posted in the class chat saying ""does anyone have recordings? OP told me to piss off when I asked for hers"".There were a few more exchanges and the conclusion is that I have the only recordings and I'm being a bitch for not sharing with Jess. I've muted the chat. My POV is that after she outed Adam, I don't want to help her at all. Everyone else's POV is that she needs my help, she's in extremely shitty circumstances, and this would be the right thing to do, plus her outing him had no repercussions beyond people in my class knowing, while me not helping her could lead to her failing the next round of assignments.AITA for not helping her?"
641,Not the A-hole,AITA for taking back my doll house that my sister’s kids have started to destroy,19537,einuyo,1631,"When I was a child my dad built me a dollhouse. It was lovely. He worked so hard on it, everything was so detailed, down to the tooth brushes, light switches, etc. imo, it’s a piece of art. I took care of it very well and he even installed a sliding plastic door with a lock on it so I could protect it from my more destructive little sister.I moved out and the doll house stayed at my mom’s. Now my mom has grandkids(my sister’s kids) and they have destroyed it. A bunch of pieces are missing, the lights have been torn out, the carpet and curtains have been torn up, the chimney is broken, etc. When I saw it I was hurt at how destroyed this incredible gift from my now deceased father was.So I decided to take it back to my house to fix it and keep it safe. My sister noticed when she took the kids to my Mom’s and it was gone so she asked me about it. She asked if she could have it or at least bring it back to mom’s bc her kids play with it. I didn’t want to start a big uproar so I tried to kindly explain that I wanted to keep it preserved how dad made it. I told her the kids can play with it when they are at my house but they needed to get better about taking care of it and not messing everything up. She got really mad and said “omg it’s a fucking dollhouse. It’s supposed to be played with. I’m not bringing my kids over so you can critique their playtime” AITA for wanting to preserve the doll house our father made?"
642,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my future father in law I’m a different race every time he asks?,19527,eclu5c,1533,"I am marrying into my fiancés white family next summer, and I have been with him for almost 4 years now, and I met his family very early on, less than a year in. I am Latina, but third generation, but I guess I must look very racially ambiguous because I get a lot of questions and guesses. That being said, my fiancé’s dad KNOWS I’m Latina. He’s met my parents, and he’s asked before. Ever since we announced our engagement, his moms been very involved in planning so we’re around his parents a lot more often. FIL has asked NUMEROUS times “what are you again?” Or “you’re (insert random race of brown people) right?” And other variations. At first I didn’t think much of it but it happens SO often that I can’t help but think it’s on purpose. My fiancé and his mom seem to not think much of it, or they’ll just laugh it off as if he’s joking or implying it’s funny that he’s “forgotten” again. This seriously happens like once a week I wanna say. So, I’ve just started “joking” back and either confirming I’m whatever he thinks I am that day, or I just tell him something random. My fiancé thought it was funny at first but has now changed his mind and thinks I’m being disrespectful. I think it’s his dad being disrespectful, and I’m dealing with it in a funny lighthearted way. AITAEDIT: I meant ethnicity not race! Sorry!ANOTHER EDIT: guys... it’s okay! I think this has gotten out of hand. My future FIL is being annoying at worst, it might have racial undertones but he’s a normal decent guy who treats me well outside of all this, not some sort of hateful racist monster. I assumed the fact that I’m able to joke back to him about it implied that this is honestly all in good fun, just because it has some serious undertones doesn’t mean it’s some sort of relationship ending catastrophe. If it helps, imagine he was calling me by the wrong name and I gave him a fake one each time. It’s not as racially charged, but it’s honestly about the same energy behind it if that makes sense. I’m engaging in this discussion and getting into the racial implications because I genuinely find it interesting and fun, but it really doesn’t have to be as serious as it’s gotten. Thanks guys!!"
643,Not the A-hole,"AITA for leaving my mom, her bf and 3 sisters?",19520,eeri3t,1852,"I recently left the house a few days ago. I was woken up at 1 p.m. with a hit on my head by my 1 year old sister and her plastic toy. I had just stayed up until 4 a.m. feeding my newborn sister because my mom couldn't. My mom just had a c-section so she couldn't move or walk for a long time so she is often on a chair. A few hours later, she and I were arguing about groceries (she spent $300 on JUST meat 2 weeks ago, so the previous week, I spent $100 on snacks and household essentials like soap/shampoo and laundry detergent, she wanted me to list everything I bought and was yelling at me when I couldn't remember) and I went to my room in the middle of the argument because I was sick of the fighting. She told me to come downstairs and continued yelling stuff like ""don't make me go up there!"" And I knew she couldn't so I just stayed in my room crying. My dad called me and I explained the situation to him, he said if I didn't like her rules, then leave. Then my 16 y/o sister texted me ""mom said to leave the house"", so I packed. A friend picked me up and I walked out with necessities, and as I walked out, my mom said ""never come back"". My friend dropped me off to my best friends house and at that point, I had cried for like 3 hours straight. That was all 3 days ago.2 days ago, my 16 y/o sister (who is pregnant and almost due) texted me that I needed to come home to watch my 1 y/o and newborn sisters for 2 hours so that she can go grocery shopping with my mom's boyfriend (1 y/o and newborn's dad, who is just recently unemployed but he's a nice guy) and I told her I wasn't coming back because my mom told me not to. My 1 y/o sister had choked on her food yesterday because I didn't go home to watch her while my mom was with the newborn, then my dad told me to drop my pride and go home just because she's my mom. This has nothing to do with pride, both my mom and dad told me to leave the house knowing she needed me. My parents had always told us kids that if we don't like living under their roof, then leave we didn't have a reason and were too scared to do it. They must've been shocked when the only child of theirs who grew up without causing any trouble in school, or getting knocked up, or getting bad grades, and always helping them and putting up with their toxic ways, left. I want to help but my mom is very lazy, I often have to do everything around the house while watching my sisters. I'm only 18, my mom won't even take me to the DMV for my permit or license, even though she did it for my brother (the eldest child, he's living with my dad). I'm under constant stress because of my mom and nothing ever satisfies her. I am currently staying at my best friend's house and with my new free time, I can finally go around and apply for jobs and make something of myself. I feel sad but I've been resenting my mom for a few years now, but I always needed to obey her just because she was simply my mom and I couldn't take it anymore."
644,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting a girl at work fired for having an OnlyFans account?,19514,k92epq,2467,"I (30F) work as a financial advisor at a rather large and well known firm, along with my co-worker ""T"" (mid-20s/F).One lunch time T was having a discussion with us about how she had started an OnlyFans and was already getting subscribers. She said they should forget about slaving away at a desk for a company and take their future into their own hands, etc.T then told me I should try it. I brushed this off, and said it's just not something I'd like to do. She asked me why, and I shrugged and said ""just because"". It's like asking me if I'd like to become an actress or a doctor, neither appeal to me. However, T didn't see it that way, and said ""what, do you think you're better than me?"" I said no, of course not, I just wouldn't consider doing sex work as a career.T took great offense, saying that if I'm happy earning peanuts working my life away for a boss just for ""dignity"" then that's on me, and I mustn't judge her for wanting to make a better future for herself, that she's not ashamed of what she is doing. She also said ""when your children ask you why they were poor their whole lives you can tell them it's because you had too much dignity to provide for them more.""(I have two children, and I am fully able to provide for them this pissed me off). She got up and went back to her desk. At this point one of my other colleagues (in a much higher, managerial position) had overheard her and asked me what had happened, so I told her. After all, T's words were she wasn't ashamed of what she was doing, she seemed very open about it. My colleague said nothing and we went back to work. I thought nothing more of it, though I was irritated by T's comments about my children and financial status. I put most of my earnings into my home, family and investment. I drive a pretty standard looking vehicle and my dress sense is rather plain, I guess.About a week later I noticed T was no longer coming into work. One of the girls she hung out with a lot at lunch time was shooting me angry looks and speaking in hushed tones to their usual group. When I sat down, the girl turned to me and said ""Are you pleased with yourself?"" I asked why and she said ""We all know you told the boss about T's OnlyFans account to get her fired"". I was taken aback, then remembered mentioning it to my colleague that day. I went to her office to ask what had happened.She told me that she had decided to investigate T's social media, which listed our company as her workplace on her profile. Her IG was full of risque photos to push her OnlyFans. As her IG and FB profiles were easily connected, my colleague said it was openly moonlighting in a way that did not reflect well on the company, and reported it. T was called in to a meeting, which ended in her being dismissed.I now feel responsible for T losing her job. Her friends have branded me an asshole, telling everyone I'm a jealous bitch, a slut-shamer etc. My colleague told me T had it coming and I must not feel bad.Reddit, AITA?"
645,Not the A-hole,AITA for ruining my brother in law's day with a purposeful fart?,19506,hgkb2y,1380,"BIL and husband co own a house that was passed to them by their father. We live in one half while BIL lives in the other. The only thing we share is the living room and kitchen, the rest is completely separate. Lately BIL has been making odd comments about my ladylikeness. I am a down home back woods dirt under my fingernails still play in mud puddles basically wood rat of a woman. He's been cutting into hard labour chores I do and tells me he'll do it so I don't hurt myself/get dirty. He'll make positive comments when he sees me cleaning (lucky man!) and says things like ""I've never seen you cook! You should cook more!"" Note, he does not cook either. I like to look nice here and there. Whenever I do dress up and do makeup, BIL makes comments about how I should do it more often and I look super nice. He has said ""dressing up for husband?"" All of these I shut down with ""I do it when I feel like it,"" ""I'm doing it for me,"" etc. He is not a bad dude overall, hes actually a riot to hang out with, but it's little subtle things spread out and it digs at me as roommates do. Luckily we're moving soon. Anyways, yesterday I belched in the kitchen because I thought no one was around. BIL pops his head in and jokes ""have you ever thought about being more ladylike?"" Now the tone is joking but the word  ""ladylike"" is like my emotional tailgating car. Tailgating only makes the person in front slow down. Telling me to be ladylike makes me turn that shit way down. I have mad props to graceful and more traditional ladies if they like it, but I am not one! I say ""nope!"" and he replies ""you should consider it"" and leaves the room. So this morning, I'm walking by the living room, BIL is watching the morning news, and I decide to grace the room with a big long fart. This is the just woke up and shit is moving fart. It is the fart that has been building all night. It is loud, it has vibration, and even in the tiny room it echoes. I'd honestly give it a good 9/10 it was a damn masterpiece. I thought it was hilarious, immediately. BIL not so much. He proceeds to jump up and rage about how gross it was (fuck I've heard him blow out farts before) and how women shouldn't do that. Unfortunately by this time I am doubled over in tears because I can't stop remembering the fart and his rage has made it even funnier. He gets beyond mad and storms off to his bedroom. It's now 9pm and he is still enraged and hiding in his room. He says it was an asshole move (technically the truth?) At first husband thought it was funny too but now since it's upset his bro so bad he's leaning towards maybe it was too much and too immature and that I should have just told him that he was being overbearing. I feel like as a 37yo man, BIL should have known better than to think he can tell a grown woman how to behave. It probably would have been better to talk about it, but who pouts ALL DAY over a fart? So, am I the asshole for solving problems with an asshole?Edit: you all are making me cry laughing again. I'm showing my husband and he's come around.Edit 2: every single fart story is killing me, I feel a tenth of my age right now.Edit 3: just woke up to this, combing through comments and loving it. BIL came to me when I went to go make coffee and said I made him feel uncomfortable in his own house. I told him it's my house too, and I've seen him do the same unashamedly. He made a couple ""but I'm a man"" comments and I called it out as sexist. He asked me how it was and I asked how it was NOT. After a few back and forths he started to understand that he is not my husband, this is my house too, and I do not and will not ever meet his southern standard for a woman. He wraps it up with ""... I guess it was kind of funny,"" and stalks off. I left a coffee peace offering in the living room, where he is enjoying saturday morning programming without a violent crop dust. We're all going to make dinner tonight and have a family make up with hopefully no dinnertable farts (I have SOME standards)All in all, pretty damn good end result. And I bet I will never hear ""be ladylike"" from him again.Still reading EVERY comment, what a way to wake up. You all are a RIOT"
646,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my friend to stop the way she shows off her “before” shots when she’s refashioning my clothes?,19491,l4u1qm,1375,"I am a plus sized gal who is really into fashion. I usually donate my clothes unless I can resell them. My friend Katie is really into “refashioning” clothes from thrift stores. She buys plus sized clothes and then alters them into her size with a lot of other changes, like making them into crop tops or mini skirts or things. It’s a really popular creative thing to do.Well she asked me if she could have first pick of my clothes because I’m actually larger than what she usually finds, and it’ll give her more material to work with. I said sure and would let her pick through my stuff I didn’t want, but asked her to tag me in her posts and point people to my shop where I sell the “nicer” things.She started showing off her refashion stuff on Instagram and I was excited… until I saw the way she did it.In Katie’s before shots she makes these really exaggerated grossed out faces where she’s draped in the oversized clothes. Or she’ll do that face where she blows out her cheeks and holds the clothes out as wide as she can and does a cross-eyed expression. It’s really obvious to the viewer that she’s trying to “mimic” a really overweight person… like me.When I saw that, my stomach dropped and I just couldn’t shake the bad feeling it gave me. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and asked her why she was making those expressions in the before shots, and she said she just thought it was funny.I told her that to be honest, it felt hurtful, as I’m the one who gave her the clothes and it looks like she’s just straight up making fun of me and my body, especially since she tags me.She told me that I’m being hypersensitive. I asked her to please just not make those faces. She told me something like “After you give me the clothes they aren’t yours anymore, so you aren’t really in the position to tell me what to do.”I thought about that for a while and in the end I did agree, if I give her the clothes they’re hers to do whatever she wants with. So my solution is that I’m just not going to give her anymore of my clothes. I told her that and she blew up on me, telling me that I’m just looking for a reason to be offended and if I’m this insecure, I should be working on bettering myself.AITA for asking her to stop what she was doing in the first place, since I'd given her the clothes?**I just wanted to thank everyone for the responses. I didn't expect this to blow up.** I want to reiterate that I don't think her refashioning plus sized clothes is the issue. A lot of people do it and it's great to use items before they just end up in the landfill. Plus for everyone saying she should just go buy fabric like everyone else, good apparel fabric is so expensive in comparison to what you can find at the thrift shop. "
647,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to meet my wife's ex-boyfriend?,19495,bzce02,4217,"My wife stays in contact with her ex who she dated for 5 years before meeting me. All they do is text each other occasionally, which I have no problem with. I explained to her early on that I am not interested in ever meeting or befriending any of her exes. She agreed and it was never an issue until now.Her ex has moved back to the city where we live and she really wants him and I to meet. Once again I explained to her that I have zero interest in such a meeting. I see no point to it, I don't need his blessing or approval, and I have enough friends. Plus the whole idea just seems awkward. She explained that it would mean a lot to her if I would just meet with him. I asked why and her response was that it will keep his mind at ease knowing that she is with someone good. I snapped a little but didn't raise my voice and asked her: *""Since when does his wants and concerns matter in our marriage?""* She didn't have answer for this and simply asked me to think about it. I know my answer is not going to change and I am honestly quite angry about this whole thing. AITA? Also any advice is much appreciated.Thank you.**P.S**I don't care if they meet occasionally to catch up, but I think I'll be getting a divorce if they start hanging out on the regular. I love my wife but I don't think I have her heart. He was her longest relationship aside from me and she lost her virginity to him.**EDIT**With regards to divorcing her over this:> I'd rather divorce her than control her. I didn't tell her that I would do this, it will simply happen. I can control what I do (not meeting him), but I cannot control what she does. It would be better to part ways instead of turning the marriage into a toxic swamp."
648,Not the A-hole,AITA for buying the dress that my friend wanted but couldn’t get because they don’t have it in plus size?,19475,ctfxcb,3550,"I and my friends are going to be bridesmaids in our friend’s wedding, and for the past few weeks we’ve been searching online for bridesmaids dresses and sharing links of dresses we like in our group chat so none of us ends up buying the same or very similar dresses. My friend Ana sent a link for a green bateau dress and literally said “I love this but they don’t have it in my size.” (She is US 14.)I agreed that the dress is beautiful while one of our other friends said that the skirt might be too wide for a bridesmaid dress. Ana went on to send more links of other dresses and our group’s conversation moved along. Yesterday Ana sent a message in our chat that she just ordered one of the dresses she showed us, and asked if we already chose a dress. I really liked the green bateau dress so I checked if they had it in my size (I am US 8) and they did so I told our group that I was going to order the bateau dress. No one replied immediately, but I didn’t think too much about it because it’s not uncommon for me and my friends to take a while before replying, specially during work hours. I ordered the dress.A few hours later I got a call from one of my friends saying that Ana called her and was upset that I ordered the bateau dress, knowing she liked it but couldn’t buy it because it wasn’t available in her size. My friend said Ana thinks I’m trying to make her feel bad about her weight by flaunting that I can wear the dress she likes because I’m skinnier. To be honest I have mixed emotions about what Ana said, but trying to fix things comes first so I tried calling Ana and sending her messages to apologize, explaining that I didn’t intend for her to feel that way. But she hasn’t answered my calls or messages. So I just want to know: AITA for thinking that there is nothing wrong with buying the dress Ana liked but couldn’t buy because they didn’t have it in her size in the first place, or is my friend overreacting?"

And...recommended, okay now she's trying to get involved this year too, anyways, he showed me pictures and the type of food they serve and asked me to pay, it's an expensive restaurant, I suggested we pick another but he insisted, I agreed and once we got there I found that the menu wasn't there which was weird because I was ready to order, about 15 minutes of my husband stalling, His parents walked up to our table dressed nicly and sat with us, I looked at my husband for an explanation but he avoided me to tell his mom that the food they wanted was ordered ahead, his mom immediately made backhanded comments about my hair,dress, WEIGHT, and didn't stop.I was literally mad, she and her son started drinking while my father in law started talking to me about ""politics"", the final straw was when she canceled the cake I wanted and replaced it with the one her husband liked, I got up, told my husband to hand me the keys or I was going to walk, he tried to calm the situation that's when his awful mom started talking about me acting inappropriately, she told her son to ""just hand me the keys"" cause she didn't want me to embarrass her.I left, an hour later, my husband came home, started berating me for overreacting and ruining dinner, I yelled at him what the F was he thinking inviting his parents, he said they paid for it so he had to invite them, started arguing saying that he saw nothing wrong with what he did, he didn't even tell me and argued about how I was being awful to his family, I went to my mom's after he insulted me and I been feeling bad eversince, his mom texted me but I ignored her."

Age of consent where he lives is 16. They are both in highschool, he is a senior, she is a junior.To my knowledge, he is still a virgin. He does know the basics about sexual health, pregnancy, prevention, and STD prevention. Another thing my mother and I butt heads about but she gave in on that one.My mother refused to talk to him about the fact that if they were to engage in a sexual relationship, it would be illegal in my home state. She said he is innocent and he's not sexually active. It wasn't necessary. I implored her to change her mind because things can progress very quickly and he needed to know.Last night I called my brother and discussed it with him myself. I didnt try to scare him, just gave him facts. He also told me they haven't done anything yet. I told him that if sex was something they are considering, they should wait until after her birthday in 3 months. I told him that sex can happen at their own pace when they are ready.  I also mentioned was not for or against him having sex, only that I wanted him to wait until he wouldn't get in trouble.I tried really hard to give a respectful but informative talk. My mother is pissed that I talked to him about it when she told me no.AITA for wanting my brother to be informed and safe?Edit: If it matters, I'm his sister and I am 26. I live out of state.

I'm going to have a follow up conversation with him about sexting and exchanging pictures also consent as a whole. I had missed that topic on the earlier conversation.

651,Not the A-hole,AITA for “stealing” ducks from small children,19455,kn14y4,911,"Disclaimer: this is a very British and polite post, not a serious issue. I live near a duck pond that has one population of ducks (when there’s food they all go to the same place, they don’t split and go to different people). I regularly feed these ducks, but today when I got to the pond there was a group of adults and children putting out seed already. No issue, I politely wait on the other side of the pond and take some pictures of other wildlife. Then the screams start. No one is being tragically murdered, the kids are shouting for the ducks to “do something” and running towards them when they do come on land. This is super not ok for me so I threw down duck food on my side of the pond and hijacked the little beauts. Mother of the Brats loudly exclaimed to Father of the Brats that I was “a bit bloody cheeky” and “stole the ducks” from her kids. Loud enough for me to hear but obviously not aimed at me (polite and British - no confrontation).I understand I did “steal” them, but I just don’t like children being taught it’s ok to harass animals.AITA for duck stealing.Edit: unsolicited duck pic on my profileExtra Edit: I wasn’t expecting so many people to appreciate Duck Tales! Thank you for the awards, and thank you comments which have made me laugh so much.For those of you saying we shouldn’t feed ducks so I’m an asshole for that, it’s absolutely not frowned upon to feed ducks in the UK provided you are feeding them the right stuff. Check the RSPB website (or your country’s equivalent) for a full list of duck friendly food (and obviously respect the duck’s personal space)."
652,Not the A-hole,AITA for not giving my food to my aunt?,19448,jm3t3r,1665,"I'm 17m. I really like cooking and I'm very good at it. I wish to become a professional chef when I grow up, and have already written a cookbook. Everybody in my family knows this about me, and on several occasions I have made (with help from my sister) meals for family gatherings.That said, I do not like sharing my food. Once I take food onto my plate, I don't like anybody else eating from my plate. I love food and always make enough so that I will feel full. If other people are going to eat, I do make extra, however I enjoy taking a full plate's serving of my favourite dishes and like to finish it all.My parents know this and so does my sister. Usually nobody else asks for me to share my food with them. Yesterday my mother and aunt went out for dinner and I was home alone. I made some crock pot spaghetti and meatballs and sat down to eat in front of the television.After 5 minutes my mom and aunt came back home. I asked them how dinner was and they said it was fine. My aunt saw me eating spaghetti and told me how mouth watering my food is. I thanked her and continued to eat. She kept eyeing my plate as I was eating and I felt a little uncomfortable. My mom saw this and said ""hey why don't you give some to aunt meg"". I chuckled and said ""oh sorry there's none left, if I'd have known you wanted it I could have made more!"" My aunt said ""that's okay you can just give me half of yours!"". I was a little taken aback and looked at my mom, but she nodded at me urging me to give her my food. I said ""didn't you guys have dinner already?"" She said ""yes but you know I can't control myself around your food haha"". She even went to the kitchen and got a plate and fork for herself and was coming to where I was sitting to take food from me.I stood up and said ""hey I think I'm gonna go finish this in my room"", went to my room and locked the door and finished my food. By the time I came out my aunt was gone and my mother was very mad at me for disrespecting her like that. Was I in the wrong here?EDIT: Holy fuck lol, thanks for the upvotes. I just want to say that I'm not overweight, I'm 6 feet tall and weigh 63kgs so I'm definitely not overweight. And I cooked in a 1.5 quart and made just enough to feed myself. And also I'm still in school so I live with my parents and they buy the groceries.You guys need to stop sending me messages about how I'm ""fat"" and ""greedy"". I'm not fat and even if I was,it doesn't matter. I do not like that you all are body shaming me despite not even knowing what my body looks like, stop fat shaming my aunt too. Although she was acting greedy that does not mean you get to shame her. Please stop."

My dad is the hardest working person I've ever known and heard of, he is my inspiration and my hero. He was born in a tin hut in rural Bangladesh and came to Canada with nothing and worked tirelessly everyday to help himself out. I am very successful and have been taking care of my dad since I graduated uni and I provide him with about $1,000 a month and my sister who's a social worker gives him about $300. His house is paid off and I paid for a full renovation to his place this year which my wife wasn't too happy about but his place needed major work. My wife came to me last week and suggested I stop giving my dad 1k a month as he now gets a small pension from work and an old age pension from the govt and he basically has no bills except for minimal utilities, food, gas on a benz I bought him for his 65th bday and personal stuff. I told her that I want him to chill now that he's older and worked hard his whole life and the extra 1k I give him helps him eat at a better restaurant, get a nicer suit, go on holidays etc. He also started seeing a woman who's in her 40's and they're pretty happy so I'm extremely happy for my dad. The money helps with dates and stuff like that and gives him a better standard of living. My wife just basically put her foot down and told me that we need to save more but we don't I pulled in 500k last year, she made around 110k and we are doing very well and have no kids and I own our condo we live in outright. She basically called me an asshole for guilting her into giving money to my dad and said he's a grown man and can figure things out himself. AITA?"
654,Not the A-hole,AITA for forbidding my trans-sister-in-law from observing me giving birth,19436,f48bf4,1052,"Throwaway obviously, this is a pretty unique situation so I think my main account will get identified pretty fast otherwise. I'm 32/F/Florida.So basically, I thought this was a pretty cut and dry situation, but apparently not, as I'm getting a lot of judgement (some bordering on abuse) from different people and my phone is blowing up. So I want to know if I was out of line.So I'm 6 months pregnant, and I've been very open about what kind of way I want to give birth. I've discussed this with my group of girlfriends extensively, along with my family. I ideally want to have a natural, unassisted birth at home, which is near a hospital if things start to shape up as problematic. Now, for this process, I want support, and of course my husband is going to be there, but also I want my two sisters to be with me. This is where things get controversial. In my many conversations with friends and family, I mentioned I want my sisters there with me. I do not want my brother there, that would just be weird! But, in these conversations, my trans-sister-in-law was present, and she got the idea she would be included in this childbirth situation. Just for reference she transitioned around 3 years ago. I was unaware of this until last week, when she told me if there is anything in particular she should bring for the birth. I calmly mentioned that I am very selective over who I want in this very intimate situation, and told her than I hope she isn't offended if she isn't there for the birthing. This is when things blew up. She lost her temper and I got a torrent of emotional outbursts.  She said that she would never be able to give birth herself and excluding her is taking away from her womanhood and depriving her of her only chance of experiencing this expression of femininity. When she found out my two sisters were going to be there she told me that I was transphobic and she has as much of a right to be there as they do. After this, I received many emails, facebook messages, and text messages from several different people, calling me  transphobe and many other hurtful things. My trans-sister-in-law is very active in the transactivism community (which I fully support), and apparently she told them what had transpired. This has obviously rallied them to harass me, and now I'm starting to wonder if I messed up. I kind of wish I never mentioned anything about the birthing process to her, maybe I should have just kept all these plans to myself so she wouldn't feel excluded. I'm aware transpeople have a pretty shitty deal in life, and perhaps this added to their feelings of exclusion. But the other part of me says, it's my birthing, I'm going to very vulnerable and exposed, and I (perhaps selfishly) owe it to myself to make it as comfortable and safe for me as possible. So AITA?"
655,Not the A-hole,Aita? For not letting my brother in law see my girls after he called CPS on me?,19412,jlla13,1349,I F33 lost my husband in an accident and he passed away shortly after he arrived at the hospitalWe have two girls who are 9 and 5 and It's been very devastating and very difficult to be taking care of them while going through these tough times. My mom would help a lot and I'm so thankful for that.My in-laws have been keeping to themselves but my brother in law would visit often to see the girls. He has always wanted kids on his own but hasn't been able to because his wife has medical issues.He treats my girls well. And has been generous but treats me poorly and makes comments and criticizes my parenting often. He implied he wanted to be their guardian but I told him no.He started demanding I bring the girls over to my in-laws house. And would get upset when I tell him I have work. He'd claim I'm clearly not taking care of the girls and don't fit to be a single parent.We got into a huge argument after I told him I no longer will be welcoming him into my house because of his behavior. And he the reported me to CPS after I refused to let him into my house.He claimed that I'm not taking good care of my girls needs/refusing to let them see their grandparents/being busy with work and other things I don't know about.I had to deal with CPS once then after they did a surprise visit and thank goodness it went well although I was told to deal with some issues that are normal in every family.I told my in-laws about what my brother in law did but didn't do anything. His wife was the one who told me eventually.It's been over a month now. My inlaws are calling to tell me that i should let my brother see the girls after I told them that only them see my girls.I refused to let him see the girls after what he did and the disrespect he shown but my in-laws are pressuring me saying these are their granddaughters and I have no right to act like this just out of spite.Edit to say that the issues I'm dealing with are trying to balance my working hours with the time I spend with the girls. I have my mom either come over or take them to her house so I could pick them up after I get off work. Another thing is therapy and my girls are currently in therapy. I'm trying to take it slow but it's just so overwhelming and then to have to deal with my brother in law's behavior is just a lot for me and there isn't anything more I want than to spend time with my girls but I have to work since no one is willing to help with anything. I'm not the person who feels comfortable asking for help so I do all I can.My brother in law says he wants to see the girls because it's been a while since he saw them and he misses them a lot but I don't want him around after what he did. I can't even look at him after this he made my grieve worse and I won't be able to forgive him soon.
656,Not the A-hole,AITA for removing all the cutlery and dishes in my shared apartment?,19404,d78ke1,3967,"I have always set a pretty basic rule for my roommates, and that is that only I can use a certain set of cutlery and dishes that has special sentimental value to me. All the other cookware, pots, pans, plates, and so on in the house belong to me, but I told them they could feel free to use all of those things rather than have to go buy their own, which would add up to a pretty large amount.Things worked pretty well at first but over time I caught my roommates (all of them) using my special things. After the third or so time I sat them down and reminded them that this stuff was off limits and wasn't to be used by anyone other than me. They all pleaded ignorance and claimed that they just grabbed whatever their hands found, and I told them to be more careful because it meant a lot to me.I came home yesterday and found my roommates hosting a few friends of theirs and all of them were using my special bowls and cutlery and nothing else but that. I see no way for this to accidentally happen, they were absolutely trying to bait a reaction out of me, but instead I just went to my room and waited for the guests to leave. After this during the middle of the night I took every pan, pot, knife, fork, bowl and plate and locked them in my room. It took up a lot of space but a point had to be made. Queue this morning, they wake up and find absolutely nothing available. Queue bitching. Queue tantrums and accusations about me being a ""dicklord"". I don't give in and tell them that if they can't respect a basic rule they can buy their own shit. I'm pretty confident in my decision and expect them to see my point after a good sit down and think, but when I regaled my boyfriend with the details he said everyone was going to think I'm an ass for good now and I had only created an awkward situation that won't go.I have no regrets, and I don't think I'm an ass, but given I lurk this sub a lot I'm curious for your verdict in this matter. AITA?"
657,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my mother-in-law that she can't control how I act in my home?,19396,aw9sou,2161,"My mother-in-law moved in with us about three months ago. It's been ok. She and I are clashing personalities and cultures, and it's come up more often now that we share a similar space. She is a traditional Hispanic woman with a strong sense of decorum and family hierarchy. I am white, liberal in all ways, and agnostic about most traditions, including and especially the need to obey elders.Before, out of consideration to my spouse and out of a belief in the my ""my house, my rules adage,"" I used to watch what I said around her very carefully because we only visited with her about once a month. But when my spouse asked if she could live with us, I said I was okay with it as long as I no longer had to walk on eggshells around her. My spouse agreed and told their mother that she needs to respect that we do and say things differently in our home than she may like. I don't know how her mother responded to that but it never came up again.Last week, my 10-year-old and I were chatting while having breakfast while she was in the kitchen. We were goofing around and making bodily function sounds to each other. We are very mature, I know. But when I said, ""I fart in your general direction!"" and made a loud raspberry sound at her (she was giggling like crazy), my mother-in-law slammed down her coffee mug and said, in Spanish, ""Don't you dare teach my granddaughter to be so disrespectful. I will not allow this kind of vulgarity in my home any longer."" And I said, in English (I can understand Spanish but can't speak it well), ""This is my home. You don't get a say in how I interact with my kids, or how any of us speak or act."" She stormed away and now isn't speaking to me.My spouse says ITA because I embarrassed her in front of our daughter and because I expected her to accept too much, too quickly. They also say that I am being a little culturally insensitive and that I need to respect that abuela will be deeply offended by how I spoke to her, so I need to apologize. But I think it was important for her to see that I will stand up for our interactions/myself and also to stick to what we originally agreed on--that I won't be policed in my own home."
658,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to let my stepsister and niece move in with me or live in one of my other properties?,19396,i7ql4a,2069,"When I was 8 my mom passed away and my dad remarried my stepmother when I was 11. My stepmother also had two children of her own Erica (11) and Becky (13). Growing up, Erica and Becky made it clear they didn’t consider me their sister and would continuously exclude me. They also recruited their cousins (from their mother’s side) and I was pretty much ostracized by them too so family events were horrible. Erica in particular really hated me and I still don’t know why. She would joke about my mom’s death, break my things (including a necklace that passed from my mom to me), would have massive tantrums when my maternal grandparents bought me anything so I was either forced to share or it was confiscated (note: my stepsisters were never expected to share gifts they got from their dad’s family), would “steal” my friends and boyfriends from me. When we were both 18, Erica ended up pregnant and decided to keep the baby. Our parents gave her both of our college funds to help her with the cost of having a baby since she didn’t work and the father wasn’t in the picture. I was devastated and pretty much gave up on the idea of college at this point. Thankfully, my maternal grandparents had been secretly building a separate college fund for me and I won some scholarships, so I was able to go to college with minimal debt.My relationship with my dad has been strained ever since. So, when I got married, I had my maternal grandpa do all of the typical father-daughter stuff. My husband owned multiple properties before we got married and has a successful business. He helped me pay off my student debt and we’re doing very well financially. My parents recently got into some financial trouble and so have to downsize their house. They’re now demanding that I let Erica and her daughter move into either my house or one of my husband’s other properties. I flat out refused. Their argument is that my husband’s sister (who is also a single mother) lives in one of these properties rent free and that if we are willing to do it for her we should be able to help Erica too. They’re now calling me selfish for making a child homeless and that my husband’s money has made me a snob. Before this, Becky and I had started repairing our relationship and had actually grown closer but now she’s stopped talking to me and I’ve been shut out again. My stepmother’s family have also reached out to call me horrible names. The thing is, me and my husband could support Erica and her daughter, and I do feel like maybe I’m being petty for holding something she did to me when we were children against her. My niece is also the one who’s going to suffer if I don’t help. My husband says Erica is an asshole who never apologised so doesn’t deserve our help anyways, but he’ll help if it’s what I want.AITA for refusing to help her?"
659,Not the A-hole,AITA for drinking alcohol at every family gathering and cryptically smiling when somebody suggested I do it because I can't handle hanging out with them?,19393,e9o8yw,1664,"I'm a grown ass man, I'm 32, my family is huge and unbelievably annoying. I'm gay and that is the Voldemort of our family. Everyone knows about it, and most are afraid to acknowledge it. For that reason, everyone is fucking weird around me, they never know what to talk to me about, they're afraid of asking me anything so they don't really know much about me or my life, and they usually end up talking about the weather, themselves, or my seven million nieces and nephews.Years ago I started dealing with the problem by coming to such gatherings as rarely as possible, and when I have to be there, I just get drunk. Not the lying-under-the-table-puking-in-Nana's-shoes plastered, but finding-everything-amusing drunk. I'm not normally a drinker, so it doesn't take me much to get to that stage.However, recently, my brother made the observation that I drink every time he sees me. He sounded almost worried and asked if I drink every day, and I said no, not at all. Then he started laughing and said: what, you only drink when you see us? Huehuehue you couldn't handle being around us sober, huh? Huehue! And I just sort of smiled, and took a sip of my mulled wine and didn't respond.20 minutes later, my mom comes up to me and says my brother's wife told her I only get drunk when I'm around them because I can't stand any of them. I ask her how my sister in law knows that, because I never said it. She goes away and comes back with my SIL who admits I never said it, but I never denied it either. They put me on the spot so I said it's not as bad as that, I just find it easier to socialize with so many people if I have 2-3 drinks.My mom and SIL were like nooope, you hate us, admit you hate us, well fine, if you hate us, fine, don't come see us anymore, who cares, we don't care, you don't care, nobody cares and so on and so forth. It was just a vomit of passive aggression that I wasn't able to get a word in, so finally, when they asked me to leave, I did.The only person who's contacted me since then is my brother, who laughed when he spoke to me on the phone and said ""they didn't mean it"" but admitted that he felt it was assholish of me to get drunk at every gathering. Honestly, the other option for me is to not go at all. I'm going because they like seeing me and being with me (despite not liking most things ABOUT me), so I feel like getting a little drunk is the less assholish route than not going at all.**Edit: yall... I just logged in after a few hours of being away... to 500 comments. Sorry if I'm unable to respond to too many.**Edit 2: Just to make it clear to the people who are under the impression my family isn't homophobic - just because I didn't list the shit they did to me or try to do to me, doesn't mean they aren't homophobic.My parents have invited strangers to our house to talk to me when I was 17, to tell me I will never find happiness, truth or love as long as I am an immoral person, they outed me to the whole fucking town when they talked to the priest and he made me the topic of one of his Sunday services, which in turn resulted in every kid I went to school with to know I'm gay, bully me, beat the shit out of me.They tried stopping me from going to university for fear it would exacerbate my gay feelings, they called me disgusting, an animal, an embarrassment, ""not my son"", my father demolished my room when I left for university and told me I wasn't welcome there anymore, I didn't speak to any of them for two years as a result of that and so on and so forth. Getting to where I am with my family now took a lot of hard hard work and ""getting over it"" and it's exhausting keeping it up, avoiding most topics about my life, not being able to be my authentic self."
660,Not the A-hole,AITA for forcing my friends to pay for my ruined wedding dress?,19385,iwgyxx,1477,"Throwaway. This incident happened a few years ago but I was recently reminded of it and I want to take Reddit's judgment.So a few years ago me and N (my then fiance) got engaged. We are both gay and female so it was a lesbian marriage. We had tons of fun planning the wedding and especially choosing the wedding dresses. N chose a beautiful dress in white and I chose a gorgeous dress in sky blue.Me and N have a mutual friend who I will call S. When we told S about our engagement he seemed weird but I just shrugged it off.Fast forward to the day of the wedding. I wake up and I find out both me and N's dresses are missing. We both immediately start to look. I text S to ask if he had seen our dresses. Here is basically how our conversation went:*Me: Have you seen me and N's wedding dresses?**S: Gay people should not get married.*I press a little further and S admits that he along with M (N's little sister) stole and destroyed our dresses.*Me: I am sending you a bill for $5,000 (the cost of both of our wedding dresses combined) so we can buy them again. If you and M don't pay that then I and N am taking you both to court.*Me and N both started crying then because we didn't know what to do. We then decide to wear another fancy dress we have though the whole day was basically ruined.After the wedding S and M surprisingly pay us and me and N go no contact with them.After we went no contact another mutual friend of ours said we should not have forced S and M to pay because it was not like we were going to get our wedding dresses back. Well the thing is me and N wanted to buy our wedding dresses again as a keepsake because they were really pretty. N's dress had flowers on it and mine had glitter and little white clouds on the skirt. We took the money and bought our dresses again and tried to move on. But I am still conflicted on whether or not we should have asked for $5,000. AITA? I am not look for judgement on cutting my friends off but on forcing them to pay $5,000.EDIT: Thanks for the all the awards! First ones I have ever got on reddit! ANd lots of people are asking how S and M stole the dresses. He lived with us in a house that me and N both owned. After the wedding we kicked him out.Me and N don't feel comfortable sharing photos of ourselves on the internet but I can write a description of the dresses. My dress was a dress like [this]( except in sky blue with sparkles on it and white clouds on the skirt. N's dress was like [this]( with purple flowers, pink flowers, and green leaves on the skirts. We designed them ourselves. Since we never got to wear the dresses on our wedding day we wear them for our anniversary, special/formal events, and on our holiday cards every year there is a picture of us in them. Wherever we are not wearing the dresses they are on a special mannequin in our room.EDIT 2: OMG! This post is the first one on the front page! And we did report them to the police but chose not to press charges. And they cut up our dresses and threw them away. That is how they destroyed them. They did not sell the dresses.EDIT 3: To all the people saying this is fake, you are welcome to believe what you want. I will not argue with you.EDIT 4: Shoutout to all the people in r/AmITheAngel who seem to have nothing better to do with their time than trash talk me and N's wedding dresses on the internet."
661,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling a guy behind me in the grocery store line to mind his fucking business?,19393,k8kryw,1928,"This happened this morning. I was at the grocery store buying some food and then while the cashier was done scanning my shit, I asked her to get me a carton of camels. I don’t smoke, they were for my grandpa.So when I asked, the cashier went to the place where they kept em. The guy behind me in line, middle aged dude, said “you’re so young, you shouldn’t be smoking.” I don’t think this was an appropriate comment even if I did smoke because its none of his fucking business. I said “they’re not for me, they’re for my grandpa.”The cashier came back with the cigs and rang em up. And then the dude piped up AGAIN and said something about how my grandpa shouldn’t smoke either. Listen, my grandpa is 92 years old, smoking makes him happy and if he wants to smoke, I’m more than happy to help. But none of THAT was this guy’s business so instead of saying something clever or snappy, I said “sorry but I don’t think thats any of your fucking business.” I was admittedly extremely pissed when I said this. The cashier gave me a look and the guy behind me said “sorry. Jesus.”I left the grocery store and told my dad about it and he said that the dude was not being an asshole but just trying to be friendly. I think he’s totally fucking wrong. The guy was being invasive and gross. But i’m also not shy about public confrontations so idk if I was in the right here."
662,Not the A-hole,AITA for exploding on my father's wife,19370,cunlba,3524,"Throwaway  Hear me out on this one.In regards to ages, I’m 17, Dad is 43, and father’s wife 27 or 28.Six years ago, it came out during couple’s therapy that my father was cheating on my mom and that his mistress was pregnant. My mom initiated divorce. Six months after the divorce was finalized, my father married his now wife and they had three kids. My dad has apologized for his actions and we are still doing therapy, so one day I can truly forgive him.I do not like my so-called stepmom, but in regards that she is father’s wife, I begrudgingly show respect. I have never called her out of her name until later in this story. If she speaks to me, I will say something back. If I am in her home, I will clean up after myself. However, I will always refer to her as my father’s wife and she will never be a prominent figure in my life. This is something she cannot accept.I have never let my true feelings about her be known, until the other day. While at my father’ house, she attempted to make a cringe-worthy joke about my girlfriend with the saying “The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice,” and said that I was good enough looking boy and she was confused about why I would go out with a dark-skinned black girl and not someone white like myself. I guess the look on my face told her to shut up, so she changed the subject.She then revealed that when my dad gets back from his TDY (Temporary Duty Assignment) she had booked a photoshoot for family portraits of us and she wanted to do a special photo of me and her two sons holding signs that say “Don’t mess with her,” with her 2-month-old daughter. I have never been in any of the previous family portraits because I refused to and my Dad said I didn’t have to.I told her I was not going to participateShe asked why I was being difficult and that just she wanted family pictures with all of her children.Six years’ worth of hurt came out. I told her she was a fool to ever think I was her child or that I considered her family. From my perspective, she was nothing, but my father’s racist side chick, who had nothing better to do, but chase after a married man and sit on her ass all day. I took it a step further and fully implied that her daughter wasn’t my father’s child because she looks nothing like him.She turned red and started crying, saying how disrespectful I was and I had no right to talk to her in such a manner. I fully admit I called her a Bitch and stated she didn’t even deserve any respect from me because she didn’t respect my mother’s marriage and if she ever disrespected my girlfriend again, she would live to regret it. After realizing what I had said, I left and haven’t talked to her since.Everyone that I have talked to say I should at least apologize for calling her a bitch and I don’t mind doing that.  However, certain people say I shouldn’t have gone off on her, because my dad was gone and she just had a baby, etc.So who is the asshole?"
663,Not the A-hole,AITA for uninviting my grandma to my wedding?,19374,lccury,1033,"So Im getting married and when I was on call with my grandmother (75) she was super excited to come and I was excited to have her there. Im her oldest grandchild, so we have a special relationship. But a few days ago she learned that my sister (my maid of honor) is gay and I invited  her girlfriend. She was furious about the gay thing and told me that either I uninvite the girlfriend or she doesn't come and I immediatelly said that if this is the way she thinks, I don't want her there. Now my whole family is telling me to just uninvite the girlfriend and reinvite my grandma. Sounds bad but I, my fiance, my sister and her girlfriend live in one appartment now (they lost an appartment for 2020 reasons) and the girlfriend has basically been my roomate for six months now. I'm very close to her, closer than my granny actually, and I really want her there. My family's opinion is that I am the asshole.EDIT: I'm eastern european and homophobia is still very present here. That's why the family is okay with granny's behaviour even tho they love my sister and ""tolerate"" her gf. It's all around them.EDIT 2: i was never considering uninviting the girlfriend. The question is am I the asshole for uninviting grandma rather than letting her make the decision.UPDATE: as many of you suggested I told my sister and her gf. My sister was mad that I didn't tell her sooner but we ended up agreeing that grandma (and one more relative actually) are not invited and no way back. Turned out granny and especially the other relative were bullying them on Facebook and other social media (but mostly fb) and were outing them online. Aparently both have been messaging my sister to verbally abuse her since she came out and she didn't want to tell me for the same reason I didn't tell her about the wedding stuff. So I'm no longer questioning who the asshole here is, so I ask mods to stop the comments (cause my dumb ass has no idea how to do that). Thank you to everyone who believes my granny can change  and I will keep trying with her AFTER the wedding."
664,Not the A-hole,AITA for embarrassing my wife in front of our friends by not going along with her lie?,19361,kppblm,1279,"When my wife and I got married, we were both working. Once our first child was born, she wanted to quit (completely her decision). I started working more to compensate and she started taking care of the house and the kid. I am a pretty clean person and I help whenever I could or if she asked. I am an involved parent. The we had another kid and I started working even more. At the end of 2019, my wife flew to her home country to visit her parents. Airports were shut down and all the flights were cancelled before she could come back. There was a lot of red tape to unravel here and we couldn't get her back home until May. Like I said, the only reason I didn't do household works was because I was working too much and I discussed that with my wife and she was also ok with taking care of the household. I have lived alone for several years and until she quit her job I always did my share of everything. I am pretty far from helpless. At first, I freaked out a little as I couldn't WFH and I had kids (7M and 2F) to take care of. In the end, I figured it out. I was stretched a little thing but it was nothing unmanageable. My wife came back home in the beginning of May 2020. She was very happy to be home and we were all happy to have her back. There didn't seem to be any problem.Few weeks ago, we have having dinner at our house with one of our couple friends when my wife told them that I was miserable without her, that the kids were miserable, that the house was a disaster, that she had so much stuff to clean up etc. She basically said that I was helpless without her and that I couldn't take care of anything while she was gone. I kinda chuckled awkwardly. I told her that the kids and I were definitely miserable sometimes because we missed her but nothing other than that was true. I told her not to lie about me or my ability take care of the kids. After dinner, she was extremely mad at me and told that I was a jerk and that I should have just played along. She told me that she felt awful that I could manage everything without her and she felt that the can't didn't need her and that she was insignificant. I obviously tried to tell her that it wasn't the case but she kept yelling at me and made me sleep on the couch. Here is the thing. Just because she isn't employed doesn't mean she can't work/doesn't know how to work. Similarly, just because I don't do things now doesn't mean I can't do it. I think it's demeaning to have me pretend that I am a man child who has to be babied / doesn't know how to do basic things / cannot take care of my own children just so that she can feel better about herself. I don't think it right to portray me as an incompetent person because she feels insecure. However she is still really upset and I am not so sure anymore. AITA? Am I the asshole for not going along with the lie?"
665,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting to talk about my children that I lost in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami?,19362,h8wnjg,1220,"In 2004, my family and I decided that over the Christmas period we’d go on vacation to Thailand. My husband had spent some time there as a child and really wanted to go back. I had two small children, a 4 year old girl and a 2 year old boy. We arrived on the 23rd of December and were due to go back on the 2nd of January. On the 26th, Boxing Day, a tsunami hit the resort we were staying in. I was upstairs in our hotel room when it hit, whilst my husband was with our children in the dining area. I prayed that my husband had our children whilst I fought for myself. My husband and I were reunited three days later, and he told me that the tsunami hit before he managed to grab our children. We stayed in Thailand for 4 months hoping our children were being kept somewhere with us presumed dead, but after searching pretty much everywhere, we presumed the worst and returned home which was the hardest thing we’ve ever done. I didn’t deal with the loss well, nor did my husband, and we ended up divorcing three years later. We couldn’t even look at pictures of the kids, and broke down just looking at each other. My family have always been as respectful as they can, apart from my mother. My mother and I have never had a good relationship. She was heavily addicted to drugs when I was born, and was in and out of my life until I was 15 when she sobered up. I was full of resentment and left the family home at 16 and we went about ten years without talking. Over the quarantine period, I have been staying with my sister and her family, and they also let my mom live with them. My mom will make dinners extremely uncomfortable for me by telling my nieces about the cousins they never got to meet, and how she felt when she found out, even though we weren’t talking at the time. Last night I finally snapped. We were sitting having dinner when my mom asked how my now ex husband is. I told her I don’t know, as I don’t, we haven’t spoken that often since we divorced. She asked if we’d still be together if the kids were alive, I asked how the fuck I was meant to know. She told me to stop being a bitch and I told her to stop bringing up my dead children. My nieces started getting upset because we were shouting, my sister told me to calm down as they’re all allowed to grieve too, which I completely disagree with. I left my sisters house and to a hotel not too far away because I seriously can’t take it anymore, but my sister has called multiple times telling me I’ve become a serious asshole since losing my children. AITA?"
666,Not the A-hole,AITA: I asked my trans daughter to choose an Indian name,19351,jyladl,1516,"My husband and I come from a traditional Indian family (immigrated to the US for college and stayed here), so please bear in mind that we really don't know much about all the nuances of the LGBTQ+ community, since we were never really exposed to that. I decided to bring my situation here so I can get some third-party advice.My ""son"" (now daughter) (15f) recently came out as a transgender girl. We immediately accepted her, told her we loved her no matter what. I got her talking to a gender specialist/therapist, we entered family therapy and my husband and I have spent a lot of time reading and educating ourselves on what it means to be trans. Unfortunately, my husband and I also lost a lot of friends and family who decided that my daughter was a freak and that we were abandoning our culture and values. While we realize that we are better off without these ignorant people, it has been tough, despite having my siblings, some close friends and my husband stand by me. So, several months ago, I joined a support group for parents of kids who are trans. It has been really helpful, and I feel like it is a great place for me to voice my concerns and also express my feelings.A week ago, my daughter brought up how she probably wanted to change her name right now, we are calling her a gender neutral nickname of her dead name (think Vikrant to Vicky). I completely understand that having remnants of your dead name can be very bad, so we told her that we would support her in her name-changing process. I also mentioned that I had a list of girl names that I never got use (I have three biological boys), and I would love if she wanted to use those names and if my husband and I, still got to name her. We even offered to do a redo of her traditional Hindu naming ceremony with her new name, which she loved. She said she would think about the names. She mentioned having a ""white"" name (like Samantha) and asked me what I thought. I told her that it was her choice, but I would love if she chose an Indian name, so she always has a piece of her heritage with her and that would make us happy. She said she hadn't thought of that and she'll come up with some names later.I mentioned this in our support group, and one white mom got really angry at me. She started saying that I was a bad mom who was forcing my daughter to pick a name I wanted and forcing her to embrace a culture that rejected her. She brought up my estranged parents, who I had talked about in previous sessions, and how I was trying to force my daughter to be more like them. That was not my intention, but I feel terrible now and can't stop crying. AITA?"
667,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my friend she isn't poor?,19354,kdajxb,1194,"So my (17F) friend (17F), complains about being ""poor"" A LOT. She's always talking about how sad she is about her family's financial state and how her parents can't afford to give them anything. Here's the thing: she lives in a very very nice house in a gated community in the suburbs. Her dad drives one of those fancy self driving Teslas. She and all of her siblings have Iphone 10s, airpods, macbooks, everything technological that they want. She shops at expensive stores like Urban Outfitters and Lululemon constantly, and has a ton of clothes. She and her family fly to Hawaii like twice a year. On christmas, they always get new phones, and sometimes a trip to Disneyland or something. It's clear to me that she's not ""poor"" like she says she is, and I feel like she's either doing it for attention or being ungrateful for everything she has. Yesterday w3hen she was moaning about how sad her family is and how she wishes she could have money like some of our other friends, I confronted her and told her that she is NOT that poor, she is so lucky and well-off compared to most of the world, and that it ws both disrespectful and rude to complain about her state. She got super upset and told me I can't juge her financial state based on what she has. AITA?"
668,Not the A-hole,AITA for Laughing and Pointing Out the True Meaning of My Friend's Asian Character Tattoo? He Is Very Upset.,19328,kksetf,1246,"My friend Jason (white and doesn't know Japanese) just got a new tattoo. He's been looking forward to his first ever ink for a while, and did a lot of research on the price, style, and local artists. He kept the design a surprise from everyone because he didn't want any negative input before he got it on his body, permanently. I mean, maybe that was a huge misstep? Just saying.Fast-forward to a few days ago, he went in for the session and told me that I'd love it (I'm Asian and fluent in Japanese). I thought maybe he was going to get a tattoo of a manga character or something. He sent me a picture of his tattoo when he was done and captioned it with the question: ""無料 Do you know what it means?"" I honestly thought it was a joke at first and replied ""Haha you got me, that's a good one!"" He called me right away and asked me in a panicked voice what I had meant. I told him the characters meant FREE, as in a free food sample. He started to cry on the phone and said it's already been a fucking hard year and I just made it even worse for him. He thought it meant FREEDOM. He hung up the phone and hasn't answered my texts or phone calls since.Well freedom 自由 isn't even remotely close to what he got. And what's up with these stupid tattoos anyway? Just why? Can someone explain to me please? Thank you.So AITA in this situation?Edit: The tattoo is above his right ass cheek. So the message is really funny. It's kind of a fail, so he'll probably have to do a Pete Davidson and get rid of it.Edit 1: Jason decided to keep the tattoo for now. He thanked me for pointing it out and agreed that it was indeed hilarious."
669,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my sister's BF the truth?,19316,gt8j76,1147,"This past weekend, my sister and her bf came to a family cook out. He's in a field that interests me so we began talking, discussing work (medical) related tests, treatments, and drugs (He's a Pharmacist and I'm a Medical Lab Scientist). During this, he suddenly looks confused about something.Sister's bf: You're oddly knowledgeable for someone who only went to community college.Me: I didn't go to community college!Sister's bf: (My sister's name) said that you did. Don't most technicians only need an Associates degree?Me: Technicians yes, but I'm an MLS. I have two Bachelors and am working on a Masters.Sister's bf: Then who went to community college?Me: (My sister's name).Sister's bf: She said that she went to (Name of good school) for Nursing!Me: She did.Sister's bf: Then why did she go to community college?Me: Because she flunked out...We continued talking and learned that my sister has told this guy a number of lies in the few months they've known each other. Things that my mother also confirmed were not true. He confronted my sister, more than a little disappointed.My sister is now accusing me of trying to sabotage her relationship, something I think she did herself. I had no idea she was lying but most importantly, one look at her credentials and this guy would have known something wasn't right.AITA?Edit 1: Just to be clear, I have three sisters. One of them is seeing a man I'm also interested in. This wasn't him.Edit 2: Several weeks ago I posted about being attracted to the bf of one of my sisters. As my first edit indicates, this isn't the same person. I'm following the advice I got in that thread and avoiding him which is why I was talking to this person instead."
670,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to fire our maid (at my wife's request),19309,bpo602,1289,"**Edit:** Well fuck me I just spoke with my maid. She says she hasn’t seen my wife cheating but that she came home a couple of weeks ago and found my wife having a glass of wine and lying on the couch with a guy she’s never seen before. From her description I’ve never heard of him either. She kept it to herself as she assumed it was just a close friend of my wife. I guess this thread serves no purpose and will get locked now. So before that happens just want to thank those of you that brought this possibility to my attention. Honestly thought my marriage was perfect I never in a million years suspected my wife would be unfaithful.--- My wife and I have 5 kids together, ranging from 2 - 15. My wife is a stay at home mom while I work a full time (8am to 7pm, 5 days a week) job. We live in Hong Kong where it's the norm to have a maid (or ""domestic helper"" as they're called here) rather than being limited to rich. Our maid is a 34 year old Filipino woman that has been working for us since she was 19 years old. She lives with us in her own room and gets weekends off. The problem is that my wife wants us to fire our maid. She hasn't given any specific reason other than ""I don't want a maid anymore."" I honestly have no idea where this change in attitude is coming from, but I don't want to fire her because:- She has helped raise my kids for 15 years and is almost part of the family at this point- She relies on this job to send money back home and it would seriously affect her and her family to lose it- We still have an infant/young children that require constant attention- I work extremely long hours and don't want to have to do cooking/chores on top of that. My wife doesn't cook nor clean so I am extremely skeptical that she will take up all the chores once our maid is goneThe woman in question is nothing but kind/polite and I don't understand where my wife is getting all of this resentment towards her.I'll mention this now in case people think she's jealous: my wife is significantly more attractive and we spend all our spare time together. Jealousy does not seem to be the case here.AITA?"
671,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting my neighbor's partner arrested?,19286,iu0k6j,1665,"About a week ago, my cat got out and went missing for a few days. I was heartbroken I put his litter box outside, hung flyers everywhere, and literally cried non-stop. It was bad.Then I noticed someone was taking down my flyers. This made me really upset, so I started knocking on people's doors. One neighbor told me that she overhead her neighbor's kid excitedly thanking his mom for a new cat, and when I walked up their driveway, what do you know MY cat was sitting in their windowsill. He immediately starting pawing at the glass when he saw me, and it broke my heart. I knocked on the front door and explained to the lady that answered that this was MY cat, he's chipped and everything, so I have proof he's mine. She literally laughed in my face and slammed the door. I knocked again, and this time a huge dude answered and told me ""this is my son's cat, now go away"" and slammed the door in my face.I went home and bawled like a baby. I called my dad (he's the county sheriff) to tell him what happened and to ask what I should do. He told me to stay home, and that he would send over a deputy to take care of it.Well, apparently the deputy let it slip that I was the county sheriff's daughter, and now the catnapper lady is telling everyone in the neighborhood I'm a spoiled brat who went crying to her daddy. But the thing is, I would have called the cops regardless. The only reason I called my dad first is because I was bawling and didn't want to sob on the phone to a stranger if I could avoid it, plus I wanted his advice on how to get my cat back. Apparently the kid's dad also went to jail because the deputy ran his plates and saw he had a warrant, so this woman is also telling everyone I got her partner arrested, too. But how was I supposed to know the guy had a freaking warrant?? I just wanted my cat back. AITA?Edited for cat tax: "
672,Not the A-hole,AITA for giving my son a better life and spoiling him more than his siblings will ever get to be?,19279,gj1nik,1140,"brief back ground. about 9 and a half years ago my wife cheated on me, got pregnant, and left me for him. courts gave them custody of our son because single dad vs family. Ive since gotten remarried and had a couple kids(7 and 5 and a half), ex and her new man have also had 2 more kids.Wife and I both work as engineers and have dang good salaries to put it lightly, ex and new husband havent ever done particularly well.  Ex wife didnt want me sending my son ""lavish"" gifts or taking him on the family vacations so her other siblings wouldnt get too jealous and build resentment towards him(her words). Meanwhile he was understandably(I feel) upset he wasnt getting as nice a life as my other kids were as he got older. he asked to come live with me, I said yes id love to have him ex wife said no. thank God the courts sided with what my son wanted. Since moving in everythings gone fairly smoothly for us. my younger kids LOVE having their big brother around all the time, he loves them, we still go on our vacations every january(though had i known how bad rona was back then id have probably held off this year), for his 16th birthday he got a nice used buick he wanted. Since then shits hit the fan with his mom/my ex though. shes PISSED how much hes getting and getting to do, keeps texting and calling both of us about how his younger siblings will never be able to get all he has and its not fair and now her kids are upset and how im a horrible dad for forcing his siblings to resent him.I finally told her i dont care i want my kids to have a good life, and if she wants an adulterer hers would have a better life too.Did I go too far there?"
673,Not the A-hole,"AITA – Friend keeps bringing his GF every time we have a get-together, so we stopped inviting him",19277,ifnhfg,1233,"First-time poster, throwaway and fake names warning. Posting as a group.Background Info: Our friend group is made up of 6 people, Me(M33), A(M34), J(M35), K(M33), E(M34) and V(M35). Now we met each other during a work event and connected instantly and each of us has a SO. Now with V, he has been with his GF for 3 years, and we have been friends since uni and ever since then, we have a ""guys-night"" once every 3 months so that 4 times a year and every time we get together V keeps bringing his Gf and it just became awkward, she would follow him everywhere, she even tried to follow him into the men's toilet. We are unable to go to restaurants because she keeps causing drama. An example of this is when V left his phone on a table at a restaurant, the waiter tapped V on the shoulder and returned the phone, V thanked her, His GF poured water on a waiter and accused her of hitting on V. The manager banned her. That is just one of the times she acted out. Me, M, A, J and K had enough, we held an intervention, asked him why he keeps bring her and that we had enough. He wasn't able to give us a proper answer, said that she keeps inviting herself to these events. Soon she was invited into our group chats and our annual camping trip.Now because Melbourne is in lockdown, we had a few online movie sessions, and she would show up and complain about the choice of movie. Now we had enough, every time she shows up, there is an issue, the choice of movie or the type of food served, the weather. Now Me, M, A, J and K told V to grow a pair and tell her enough is enough, he refused to do so, said this is him proving his love for her. So Me, M, A, J and K decided that until he had a proper sit-down and talk things through with her, we would not invite him to any of our events, he and his Gf called us Assholes, while our SO also agree with them.Edit: Judging by how many people are asking about why we only meet 4 times a year. I just need to clarify that we see each other a lot due to working together at the same office. We only meet 4 times for guys-night, which is supposed to be just us 6, not our GFs or other co-workers. Just needed to clarify that. And HUGE THANKS to everyone who rewarded this post."
674,Not the A-hole,AITA for embarassing my sister infront of her baby daddy,19273,jggt2n,715,"I (20f) still live at home with my parents and my 4 younger siblings. My older sister (29f) has her own place where she lives with her son. At the start of the lockdown (march)my sister decided to come stay with us.My sister had started this rude af habit of snapping her fingers to get someone's attention. Like she will say their name once and then start snapping her fingers in their direction. She even does this to my mum and dad.My nephew (1.8)has a habit of copying any actions we do and this would be one of the rudest things for him to learn so i decided to nip it in the bud before it caught on.At first i would just tell her to stop doing it cause its rude but she never listened. Now, my sister hates it when my siblings and i treat her like our youngling, so i changed tactics and honestly it was more effective than talking to her. Everytime she would start snapping her fingers at anyone, i would walk to her, push down her hand and in the most patronizing voice i could manage, i would say to her, ""use your words brenda, we are smart,i promise we will understand"". It works like a charm everytime . And everyone finds it funny. Well after many months of this, it is now a reflex action as i do it alot.The other day while her baby daddy(theyre not 2gether)was visiting, she started snapping her fingers at my mum. I was walking by her to go to the kitchen and without thinking i just did the thing and walked on. Well the babyman was amused. He burst out into the loudest laugh and cackled for a while. Later when he was leaving he told me i was funny and laughed a little more.Apparently babyman told the story to all their friends and they were kekekeing about it and my sister has been hissy since. But she has not done the snappy thing again so i guess it worked. Anyway now everyone is saying that i shouldnt have done that but reddit AITA.ETA...when i said it worked like a charm, i meant that in that immediate instance she would stop and call the person by their name although she would repeat the snappy thing again later. Also i had to do it over 10x a day for almost 8 months...so belive me when i say it was reflex....you know an action you do without thinking cause its so obvious."
675,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling my children that if they don't grow up and get real jobs, they aren't getting a penny from me when I die, and then giving them a reality check?",19271,kr0fpm,2378,"ThrowRA. I'm not dyingTL/DR: My kids thought they'd get my savings when I die. I told them no, then lectured them.I (57M) have two kids, N(30M) and A(27F). N works part-time flipping burgers, but insists his real job is as a gaming streamer. A claims she's a 'professional' influencer, her livelihood supported by her bf. My kids are adults, what they do with their lives is their choice. We've had **several** arguments about it, but ultimately, as adults, the responsibility for their lives is their own.Over Christmas, we were talking about their mother (on zoom) when A brought up the subject of her will, wondering if she'd left anything to them. I confessed that she passed before ever writing one, and the money she did have was used up the year she passed. We were a dual-income family in a time when neither of us were making a lot. It was a hard time. Eventually, I joined a friend in the private sector and my fortune changed. I'm not 'rich', but I'll never be uncomfortable again.Well, N then decided to 'lighten the mood' by implying that I'll make up for it when I pass. I asked him what he meant, and the conversation went as followed:Me: What do you mean?N: Well, you have a lot of money, right? It'll go to us.Me: And who told you that?A: What do you mean?Me: I've made it very clear that I don't approve of the way you both live. You both chose not to get an education or real jobs. You have no way of supporting yourself. (I often buy them groceries). You refuse to help yourselves, so why would I enable your 'lifestyles' by leaving you my savings when I die? You want my money, then grow up and get real jobs, but the bank of dad will be forever closed when dad is forever closed.What followed was a heated argument where both N and A accused me of being manipulative and unsupportive, so I got real with them.Me: You both refuse to grow up. Flipping burgers is an honourable job, but it's not going to keep a roof over your head. What if you have kids? What if you get fired? And (A), what will you do if your boyfriend breaks up with you because all you do is sit on your ass all day and take photos of yourself? You want to do that, find a modelling agency. A **real** job. You both speak of chasing your dreams, but neither one of you are in any position to do that because neither of you wants to take responsibility for yourselves **right now**. I've said it a million times. You're adults. What you do with your lives is your choice **and your responsibility**. Dreams take money, and neither of you have that. Grow up. Get a job. A **real** job. **Then** chase your dreams. I'm not going to leave a penny to either of you if your life plan is to 'get by' until I die, then coast through the rest of your lives off the earnings of my hard work.N ended the call after a prolonged silence. A called me an AH then did the same. I haven't heard from either since, and neither will take my calls.So, AITA here? I think I might be because I was unnecessarily harsh on Christmas.Edit: Some of the feedback coming at me is because I'm critical of their 'jobs'. To be clear, a job is something that you make money from. Neither earn any money as a streamer or 'influencer'. And I defend my opinion of flipping burgers. It's an honourable job, but not a career if you're doing it part-time like my son, thus making him ineligible for promotion. If he were working it full time, I would be worried, but I'd know he's taking responsibility for his life.  Edit 2: This conversation has come up a lot during the pandemic. My son was laid off, and my daughter isn't working, but both have been speaking a lot about their jobs as a streamer and influencer while bringing in no money to show for it. We've argued about it a lot and it just came to a head when they brought up my will."
676,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking boyfriend why he packed condoms for a trip he's taking without me?,19273,abiar4,2497,"Sadly this is a serious question.In an exclusive (not open) relationship for 8 months. BF [30s] is leaving abroad for 3 weeks and invited me [also 30s] over last night since it was the last time we'd see each other for a while. He wasn't done packing for the trip, so there was stuff everywhere. I saw the condoms in his clear Ziploc bag (NOTE: plainly visible, I did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course I asked about them. His response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.Reddit, I watched him combine OTC meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. I don't think anything in his bag is in there by ""accident."" But now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like I ruined New Year's for asking this. AITA for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?EDIT: He has never cheated previously, doesn't know anyone in this country and is going there for a fairly intensive field research project. I don't believe he has an active plan to cheat. I am, however, upset, because to me the act of bringing condoms is an active refusal to close the door on the possibility of intimacy with someone else if the opportunity happens to arise."
677,Not the A-hole,AITA For banning my former Mother-in-Law from my house because she keeps showing up and letting herself in?,19240,lnmcyv,1382,"My former Mother in Law is 52 years old and I am 32 years old. Back when I was 23 I married I got my then girlfriend pregnant, we married soon after and she gave birth to our little girl. 2 years after my wife got extremely sick and passed soon after, leaving me with our daughter.I decided to move several states away back to my own parents as I work a lot and my parents volunteered to help me with my daughter. This went on for a while until I made a good promotion and had enough saved up to get my own house half an hour away from my parents and since then watching my daughter during the day while I am at work is split between the nanny I hired and my parents, before you think I am taking advantage, my parents insist on watching her. My daughter is 8 now in case you wonder and I generally work 8 to 6.My former mother in law decided to move to the town I live because she wants to be close to her granddaughter/my daughter. I initially had no issue with this, after all my wife was her only child and my daughter her only grandchild. I only started having an issue when she actually moved.Since she moved here she was at my house pretty much all day including when I got home after work and the weekends. She would even be there when my daughter was at school and no one was home to clean. After having multiple conversations and arguments with her where I stated I was of the opinion her behavior was innapropriate and she was crossing boundaries she finally toned it down for a while, however slip ups were and are common.Last week was the last straw for me, since the past year and a half I have started dating again and met a woman, however due to Corona we have not been able to spend much time together with everything opening up here I invited her over after asking my parents to watch my daughter, when we were ""fooling around"" on the couch my ex mother in law let herself in of course without calling, knocking or asking and proceeded to lose her shit and accused me of cheating and disrespecting my deceased wife.I finally had enough, I went over, snatched my key from her, forced her oit of my home and told her she is no longer welcome in my house.She really has no one else and several people including my parents have weighed in asking me to change my mind, I am not sure if I am the asshole here."
678,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling a pregnant woman a c***?,19237,d7rju6,80,"I was at the bookstore the other day and as I approached the cash I saw a very angry and very pregnant woman who was visibly very upset. As I got closer I listened to her as she bombarded this teenage girl working the register. She was upset that a book that said it was in stock online wasn’t available at the store. She was complaining that she had wasted her time and energy by coming down to the store when the book wasn’t available. The girl at the cash was looking extremely uncomfortable and I could tell she felt bad. When the girl said there was nothing she could do, the pregnant woman started cussing at her and calling her stupid and a “inconsiderate little bitch”. As the girl was calling other stores to try and track down the book the woman looked at me and expected me to side with her said “what’s the point of customer service if they won’t help you?” At this point, I had felt horrible for the young girl and I knew I had to say something. So I looked at the woman and I said “I just hope whatever you give birth to isn’t a total c*** like his mom”. The woman looked at me in total shock and then started cussing at me telling me her husband was in the parking lot. I said I didn’t care and that she should just go to a different store because she was making everyone uncomfortable. She cussed and swore at me before calling her husband on her phone. He came in, didn’t say much (I’m 6’2, 210 pounds) and then convinced her to leave. As she left she flipped off the store and told me to fuck myself. Now, I still think sticking up for the girl was the right thing to do, but my friend that I was with told me it was inappropriate to call a pregnant woman the c word. I felt like if there was ever anyone who deserved the c word it was this woman. The cashier was using her hijab to wipe tears from her eyes after- the woman humiliated her. She thanked me by the way and her manager comforted her, so I think she’s ok. Ps, in the parking lot, the woman honked her horn and flipped me off as she drove by. I still feel it was the right thing to do, but is my friend right in saying I was wrong in using the c word?EDIT: a few people have mentioned that I should not have included the hijab comment. It was not my intention to mention her religion for brownie points, I meant that it was very upsetting to see her trying to hide the fact she was crying because she was so embarrassed, and she didn’t even have the chance to get a Kleenex because this woman was just relentlessly going after her. Sorry if it came across as pandering. Was not my intention.EDIT 2: MGTOW go away. Don’t make this into one of your vitriolic attempts to bash women."
679,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my friend I didn’t appreciate paying for a $200 meal at her husband’s birthday party?,19232,ashfts,1983,"My friend invited my husband and me to a 40th birthday party for her husband. The party was going to be at a fairly upscale restaurant with dancing afterwards. We’ve been working on some remodeling projects, so we’ve been on a strict budget. My husband and I wanted to attend the party without breaking the bank, so we decided to share an appetizer and entree and only have one drink apiece.When we got to the party, we were ushered into a private party room. When we were seated, we were given preplanned menus with several options for appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I asked a passing waiter if I could order a la carte instead of getting the preplanned menu. The waiter indicated that the meal was being paid for by the hosts and because were were part of the party, we needed to order form the preplanned menu.My friend is a bit wealthier than we are and has always been really generous about their parties, but I was blown away that they would host 15+ people at this restaurant.As the meal was ending, the main server approached my friend’s husband with the check. My friend’s husband seemed to be a little upset, and said, “I know this isn’t how you normally do things but we are only paying for the wine. We told you that.” I suddenly started panicking inside. I was trying to catch someone else’s eye to see if they were panicking as much as I was. One other couple looked horrified, but everyone else seemed calm. I opened the check, and the total was $211. I thought I was going to throw up. I have never spent that much on a meal.I held my shit together because I didn’t want to make a scene. The couple that looked horrified sidled over to us and we asked if they knew how much it was going to cost and that our friend wasn’t paying. They said they had asked waiter too, and he had indicated the hosts were paying.I ended up messaging her and said, “Thanks so much for inviting us to \*\*\*’s party. We had a great time. Just a heads up for next time, we really need to know if going to a party is going to cost more than $100. We are on a really tight budget, so a heads up would be appreciated. Thanks again.”My friend said, “Sorry! Should have given you a heads up. Glad you came.” And we haven’t spoken or hung out since. I’ve tried to set up coffee dates and girl’s nights but she just bails or never responds. It’s been almost 3 months, and she doesn’t seem to want to talk to me at all."
680,Not the A-hole,AITA for locking my daughters diary,19221,kt9gvc,1512,"AITA for placing a lock on my (41) daughters (11) diary so my wife (36) would stop reading it.  There was a recent post about a father who discovered his wife had been reading their child's diary without her knowledge and the father wanted to tell his daughter the truth.  I, naively, shared this story with my wife to gain her insight and  I thought we were on the same page.  I was wrong.For simplicity I'll start calling daughter A and wife K.About a week ago K revealed to me that she had been reading A's diary because she was worried about her mental health.  Honestly I think she was concerned because A had started talking to a counselor and wouldn't share what was said during those sessions.  She found out that A was very angry with her and is not handling this info very well.I told K that I was incredibly disappointed and this was a serious invasion of privacy.  She was obviously upset that I didn't agree but was completely unrepentant about her actions and said she had no intention of stopping.So I bought a lock and told her it was to keep her older brother (13) and little sister (6) out of it.  I did not mention her mother, I just can't bring myself to tell her.My wife now thinks ITA because she just wants to gain insight into A's mental health and I believe she should sit down and have an honest conversation.  So Reddit what do you think?Edit:  First I want to thank everyone who contributed to this post.  Your well wishes did not go unnoticed, you advice was taken to heart and your stories have opened my eyes to so much that needs to change in my house.  The awards where humbling and greatly appreciated.  I hope there was some catharsis for those that shared and please know my heart hurts for you all.  My wife and I have begun talking about attending therapy ourselves.  I think she may have noticed the lock and gotten the message, I don't know for sure.  I am going to sit them both down and we are going to go over A LOT of the advice here.I also want to thank those that offered the harshest criticism.  You gave me some of the greatest clarity.  I love my wife for all her imperfections and she loves me with mine so I think its worth the fight."
681,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling my BF that if he doesnt go to work, hes no longer using ANYTHING of mine (including my car AND wifi)?",19215,k05722,849,"28f/29m been together for like 4 years I think. I love this guy to death but when I say he is lazy, that is seriously a huge fucking understatement and doesnt even shed an ounce of light on the actual problem. Hes also a gaming junkie-like the worst of their kind. For example, when a game is being released, he waits up until midnight to purchase the game (no matter how expensive) and will binge on it for weeks straight while hardly sleeping. During this time you will be lucky to get so much as a ""hello"" out of him without him getting pissed for you disrupting him. BUT still expects people to literally cater to his every need so that he doesnt have to get up to do anything. I dont entertain this because I'm not his fucking mother.Anyways, a year and a half ago I had to give him an ultimatum. You either get a fucking job and start supporting yourself OR you can leave and go mooch off someone else. He chose to get a job. Lasted a month before he quit. Found another job 2 months later, lasted 2 weeks and quit. He was unemployed for 11 months when he finally landed this job in September. Assassins Creed was just released, what, 2 weeks ago and he started calling out every. single. day. Started staying up until 4am playing his game, would sleep until 8-10am and then be right back at it while asking me to cook and cater to him.Yesterday I unplugged and hid his xbox. I knew he was going to call out and jump on his game. As I suspected, that's exactly what he tried doing. He picked a fight with me. Said he hated working and I was forcing him to waste away his life. Claimed he was depressed, though that's the first I've heard of it. He then tells me to get off my lazy ass and do something for once. I told him to leave. He takes my car because his is ""on its last leg""- his words. Hes not in work clothes so I know he wasnt going to work. I texted him and said ""If you arent going to work, bring my car back. And if you plan on flaking on this job like the rest of them, you will not be using my car or my internet. Make your choice."" He texted back saying ""You trying to mother me all the time is a fucking turn off. You holding things against me all the time also makes you a fucking asshole.""AITA?"
682,Not the A-hole,AITA : 17 year old entered my car and stole things of value and his mother thinks an apology is enough...,19198,ibzw4o,1191,"Update: This is on AITA because I have had an intrinsic debate. Am I the Asshole for wanting the book thrown at him? For going after a reimbursement or some sort of punishment?  Is he just a kid? Am I being petty?  As someone who is empathetic to others, I have been unsure of my position. However, many of you have made me feel as I am NTA! So, thank you!Police are dragging their feet and stating that meeting with the family at the behest of the hotel has basically voided our claim to a burglary. The state attorney’s office stated that it’s not true. Let us see if the police and state attorney get it together. ______________________ ______________________We had a staycation this weekend. We visited a local luxury resort and parked our car with the valet. Upon departure we found that items were missing. We reported it to the valet and after investigating with the police, they found that some teens were going through the parking lot removing items from cars the valet left unlocked.Police reports were filed, the people were located and they happened to be guests at the hotel with their family.We were asked to meet with the mother at 7:00 pm to retrieve our items. Let me say that we are not rich. We work fucking hard. We have 3 kids. We work days, nights, weekends to be ok and get ahead. This day/night was some time for our family to enjoy themselves before we headed back to weeks of nonstop work.Anyways... the mother arrives and sends her son with the security to ‘apologize.’ I stated, I didn’t want an apology, just my things. Upon reviewing the bag I was handed, it was incomplete and what was there was damaged. (It was sunglasses, RayBans to be specific, a matching pair that I got my husband and I for Christmas). They were in great condition in their cases in the car. We literally use them in the car and put them back. We’re weird like that. Both the mother and son become aggressive, stating that’s all he took and now we got it back so they’re done. Ummmm... no.Did I mention, we work fucking hard?Your kid STOLE from me. She insulted me, called us bad people in front of my kids. She tried to use the ‘you’re a mother,’ card. Yes, I’m a mother but I would sell my kids stuff if he stole from you or I’d make his 17 year old ass work to pay it off. She kept stating I was incorrectly stating the value, so, I pulled out the receipt. Don’t you love how they email those things now? In the end we left and will proceed with trying to go through court. The entitlement on the woman and her 17 year old grown ass son was too much for me. I do not accept your apology. You can’t insult and berate someone and demand I accept your apology without a good faith effort to replace what was lost. I was a child, I crashed, my dad paid.As parents were responsible for our children’s actions and teaching them sorry doesn’t cut it.So, AITA?Adding: The mother kept stating that money isn’t an issue, she’s a lawyer... So, it’s not a situation where they just couldn’t afford to make it right. She just felt she didn’t need to."
683,Not the A-hole,AITA for finally poking back at my childfree sister-in-law?,19197,evbyg8,1667,"My wife's sister Abby is ""childfree.""  Neither my wife nor I could care less about whether Abby decides to have children, but over the years we have tolerated quite a bit of performative child-hating from her.  Calling children ""crotchfruit,"" talking about how dumb people are for becoming parents, and so on.We had our first child last year and as a result she's been less outright rude about children but more bragging about how our lives are harder now and hers is free of responsibility. Stuff like ""I think I might go to Europe this summer.  I'll tell you about my trip for when you're able to go there in twenty years.""  Or talking about a concert she's going to go to, to which she says she'd thought about inviting her sister, ""but it starts at 9 o'clock and I'm sure you'll be in bed by then.""  You get the idea.There have been lots of comments like this, but I've noticed that while Abby talks a big game, she never does seem to do any of the stuff she talks about.  She doesn't actually travel.  She doesn't ever seem to actually go to any of these concerts or shows or anything - whenever I ask her about them, she always tells some vague story about how she decided to skip it just this one time.  It seems to me like she likes the idea of having freedom more than she likes exercising that freedom.She was over last weekend and had said something snarky about my kid so I was already kind of annoyed before she started talking at length about some TV show she'd been watching.  And I just couldn't help myself and said something to the effect of ""for a person with such a fun childfree lifestyle you sure do have a lot of Netflix recommendations.""Anyway: she's really mad at me now.  AITA?**EDIT:** OK, despite the top comment, there were enough ESH judgments in here that I went ahead and called her to apologize for being a dick.  She accepted it and admitted that she'd been pretty rude to us herself.  I have a lot more sympathy for her after this conversation - I don't think I understood quite how aggressively my mother-in-law pushed on both her daughters to provide grandchildren, and it seems likely that Abby has lashed out at us as a poor substitute for the things she wants to say to her mom.  Anyway, thanks for the help!"
684,Not the A-hole,AITA for locking my roommates girlfriend out of my room and bathroom?,19155,kcvy2p,2043,"I 21M share an apartment with another guy John (22M). John started bringing his GF Macy around a couple months ago. Which I didn’t have no problem with. She’d just stay here couple nights a week. Problem started happening over a month ago. Macy came to my room once and asked if she could use my bathroom (apartment has a bathroom in each individual room) because John’s is a fucking mess. I’ve been in there before and I agree. He never cleans it, tub is stained an full of hairs, streaks of piss on the toilet seat, smells like shit, and looks as bad as mens restroom at a public park. Kinda wish I never let her. After that whenever she was there she’d ask if she could use my bathroom or straight up go when I’m not there. How did I know? I started noticing toilet paper balled up in my trash bin. My ex used to do this too when she would change her tampon so I knew right away. Then she would literally use my shower when I’m not there because I also started seeing like these long ass hairs stuck on the shower tile.Not only that, I work night shifts so until late afternoon I’m sleeping in my room. She would wake me up to ask if she could use the bathroom. After I started saying no, she just started sneaking in. I’m a heavy sleeper but a couple times I did catch her and she apologized but it’s because she can’t stand using John’s bathroom.I’d tell her to tell him to clean it then and problem solved but she says he promises he will then never does. I’m already irritated with this and don’t want her continuing going in my bathroom. So I went and got a lock for my room. Few days ago John was pissed with me.Turns out while I was sleeping she kept knocking on my door trying to go in but the lock kept her out. Anyways she needed to pee really bad and John was already using the bathroom and had the uhh...runs. So yeah I guess she was banging on my door but couldn’t hear cause I was knocked out and also had my headphones on.She ended up having a small accident cause she couldn’t hold it any longer. Because of that she got mad at John so now he’s mad at me. I told him why I got the lock and I don’t want his girl coming into my room whenever she wants to use the bathroom. It’s weird and she leaves her own mess too. Still thinks I was a dick for getting a lock in the first place and doesn’t think it’s such a big deal for her to use the bathroom because it’s not like she snoops in my room (I mean idk sometimes I’m not there). Also dramatic according to him to go through all that trouble. Macy is giving me the side eye whenever she’s there now and says I didn’t have to be like that with her. So yeah I didn’t mean for her to have an accident. Don’t think I’m overdoing it by getting a lock when I kinda feel like I didn’t have another option. I wasn’t TA here tho was I? Cause they sure as hell acting like I am"
685,Not the A-hole,AITA for showering my niece?,19147,c41y2n,2522,"Obligatory  ""longtime lurker, first time poster"" disclaimer. Also a heads up I personally find this whole situation fucking ridiculous but enough people are mad at me that I feel like I'm losing my goddamn mind trying to figure out what I actually did wrong. So last weekend I  [25M] was watching my niece [3F]. I have a daughter [5F] myself and she loves when my niece comes over to play as she doesn't have any siblings yet and it's fun for her to have another kid about. On this particular day, the girls were playing outside and decided to make mudpies. Okay cool, my kid does that shit a lot. What was *less* cool was when they apparently decided to *become* mudpies. Seriously I went inside for like a minute to answer the phone and when I came back they were both head to toe covered in mud and finding it hilarious. I immediately whisked them both inside and threw them in the shower together. I helped them wash their hair, made sure they had a proper wash and then gave my niece some old clothes of my daughters in her size to wear while I washed hers. I thought this was the best course of action in the situation - honestly I didn't even think twice about doing it. My SIL does not agree. She keeps saying that it's ""weird and creepy"" for me to have showered her daughter as a man who isn't her father and that I should've called her to okay it first. That mindset is kinda confusing to me. Like, she's a 3 y/o toddler, she's in a shower with my own 5 y/o kid who I always supervise at bathtime lest my bathroom turn into the lost city of Atlantis. Plus, what was I supposed to do? Let her sit covered in mud til somoene could come get her? However, my brother and both her mother and mine seem to agree that it was at least a bit weird for me to shower her when I'm a man and not her dad. Are they right and I'm missing the point or am I right that there's nothing weird about it?ETA: some things that keep cropping up in the comments so I'll address them. 1. My daughter's mother is dead and I'm single, so no there wasn't a woman about who could've done it instead. 2. Idk if my SIL was abused. Will throw out there though that I was abused by an older guy at 16 and we had a family friend who wasn't quite abusive but definitely exhibited some creepy behaviours to my siblings and I as kids.3. I was *NOT* in the shower with the girls and idk why so many people think I was. I never shower even with my own daughter and certainly wouldn't with anyone else's. 4. Yes they're fine with me taking niece to the toilet and wiping her and that.5. Thanks whoever gave me silver."
686,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to apologize to my SIL after she was rude during my daughter’s birthday dinner?,19147,j70rku,1248,"I (39M) lost my wife earlier this year, then my job was affected by the pandemic. My daughter just turned 13, and knows we’re not doing the best financially. My job picked back up thankfully, but we don’t have a lot of extra money yet. For my daughter’s birthday, I invited my parents, brother, and he invited SIL, to have a small dinner with us over the weekend. I really tried to make it enjoyable for my daughter. I made her favorite meal, spaghetti with my wife’s meat sauce recipe, a copycat Olive Garden salad and dressing, and homemade garlic bread. I then was able to get a few small gifts for her. I even made a small cake. It was iced atrociously, but I tried.I have never liked my SIL, she looks down at our family and she was always awful to my wife. Still, I’m usually able to be civil to her. We ate, and my dad wanted my daughter to open her gifts. I am thrilled because while it wasn’t much, she seemed very happy about what she received from my parents and myself. My SIL made snarky comments during dinner and gift opening, which I could tell irritated my daughter. Afterwards, my parents left, and my daughter went to FaceTime my wife’s parents. My SIL stalked into the kitchen and started berating me about being cheap for her birthday and then saying “what would your wife think?”I shouldn’t have, and I admit I completely lost my temper but I was so angry I told her my wife would be thrilled I managed to pull something together, including ignoring her snotty comments all night, but considering she showed up completely empty handed but had no problem shoving her mouth full of the food I made, and criticizing everyone who did make an effort, she didn’t have any room to be calling anyone cheap.She ran to my brother crying and they left in a huff. My parents called saying my brother was saying I was rude to his wife and ruined the night. I told them what happened and they are angry at SIL and my brother now. Brother is still blaming me and is now having a fit because I said she wasn’t welcome in my home again and if that meant not seeing him, so be it. My brother says I should apologize for being an asshole to keep the peace, but my dad says to stick to my guns and she doesn’t deserve an apology. I do not plan to apologize, but AITA for it?TLDR: AITA for making my SIL cry after telling her off after she’d been rude all night during my daughters birthday?"
687,Not the A-hole,AITA for making my husband choose between me and his son?,19122,gx5he9,1963,"I (39f) am married to Dave (44m), and he has a son named Avery (19m) and an ex wife named Dianna (42f.)  Avery has always been hostile towards me, and blamed me for his parents’ divorce, despite his dad not meeting me until three years after. I have tried my best to spend time with Avery, and I’ve been respectful of all the boundaries he set with me. Avery still hates me. It was fine with me, as long as he didn’t treat me like shit because he hates me.Well, Avery started treating me like shit when he found out his dad was marrying me. He threw a fit, saying his dad needed his permission before marrying me, and that he wouldn’t come to the wedding. His dad and I let it slide, and sat down with Avery and Dianna to try and figure out why he was upset. It didn’t work, and Avery refused to see us until the wedding.At Dave and I’s wedding, Avery objected to us being married in front of everyone, and asked to make a speech in front of everyone later in the night. In his ‘speech,’ he told everyone what a horrible person I was, and that I was responsible for his parents’ divorce, and that I was a dirty homewrecker. Dave drove Avery back to Dianna’s, but the damage was done, and several wedding guests assumed Avery was telling the truth. My wedding night was ruined because of this, and a good part of my family refuses to speak to me despite me explaining to them that this was not the case.Avery has continued to treat me like shit since then. He got mad at me once, so he dropped my cat off at a shelter two towns over, and refused to tell me where he was until he’d been put down. I wanted to keep my wedding dress after the wedding, and he tore it to shreds. (Just two examples, I’ll give more if anyone wants them) Finally, Wednesday, Dave and I had Avery over for dinner because Avery actually wanted to come. Long story short, when I went to get dessert and Dave wasn’t there, Avery confronted me in the kitchen and began screaming at me and told me that I was a horrible person, as well as some other not-so-nice things. Dave eventually came in, Avery left, and I got pissed. I told Dave that I was tired of his son constantly attacking me and treating me like shit because of something he knows didn’t happen, and that I’d put up with his bullshit for the last six years. I told him that he had to make a choice between me and Avery, because I wasn’t putting up with Avery’s shit any longer, and if it was a requirement of being married to Dave, I’d be filing for divorce. Dave told me it wasn’t fair to make him make this decision, and I told him it might not have been fair, but it wasn’t fair of him to let his son harass and attack me for years.AITA for making my husband choose between me and his son?Edit 1: I’ve told Dave that I didn’t want to be around Avery several times, and got ignored. I was told that we’d go to therapy to try and sort things out and it never happened.Edit 2: I don’t know why Avery blames me for the divorce. If your question is about that, I can’t answer you.Update: "
688,Not the A-hole,AITA For blowing up when I found that my husband recorded my therapy session?,19082,lcgqli,2305,"My 26F. Mom passed away in Dec. It was hard for me to process what happened. I have to say me and mom had a lot of issues between us. There's so much that I couldn't say to her. And I'm struggling with grief. My dad is deceased my mom was my remaining parent. And growing up I had many issues with her. I went no contact with her several times. Then I re-connected with her. Then we'd get into an argument again and the same thing happened. I feel bad for not trying enough to fix the situation. I keep getting shamed by family members asking if I'm happy now that my mom is gone- but how can someone be happy when their mother pass away? I'm a mess plus I'm 5 months pregnant after 2 miscarriages and it's been difficult.I started therapy two weeks ago. It's online therapy. I go into the bedroom and I have my session with my therapist. I ask my husband to not come into the room or interrupt after he insisted he wanted to be in the room but wasn't allowed. He then started coming in several times just barging in. Brining me coffee or water but I know it's a way for him to hear something. I got annoyed I told him he was causing me so much stress and he stopped coming into the room.2 days later. My husband stopped asking me questions all of a sudden. Stopped insisting on being in the room, stopped interrupting my sessions. I thought he finally got it.But yesterday as I was doing some cleaning. I heard my own voice coming from the bedroom. I was puzzled I walked into the bedroom and found my husband with his phone on his ear listening to my voice. I then realized that he recorded my voice during my therapy session and was playing the recording. I asked him he said it was nothing then he admitted it was a recording of my therapy session. I lost it I blew up and I started yelling at him. He told me to calm down it was no big deal. And that he was just curious to know and also wanted to ""figure"" out what ""my problem"" is and maybe help out. I told him it wasn't his place and just because we're married doesn't mean he can disrespect me and be inconsiderate of my feelings. This is a very important thing to me and he kept saying ""I'm sorry but I just couldn't help it"". I was infuriated There were things between my mom and I that I find hard to talk about and I found what he did disrespectful.Iwalked out and he kept saying I overreacted and that he's not a stranger he's my husband. I went to stay with my sister who said I was harsh on him and shouldn't have reacted this way.He apologized and said he already deleted it. Even said that I can take a few days to stay with my sister to calm down after he saw how much I was mad.I should mention that he mentioned several times that he was worried about me because I haven't been talking to him much. And I understand he was worried but that is not an excuse.* Information: I'm sorry I forgot to mention my husband's age. He's 31."
689,Not the A-hole,AITA for possibly costing my son his best friend,19091,jcapg8,1026,"2nd update:Just wanted to say thank you for the incredible outpouring of support. I could have never imagined my post blowing up the way it did. I heard from so many people who have had similar experiences, I am hopeful that maybe Epic who is Fortnites creator can see this and give us a parental control that would block gifting. That in itself seems like it would be huge help. To the people who had to go over the top, please look at yourselves, calling a 10 year old boy a cunt, threatening violence and just being overly rude. He is a kid who got off the tracks and yes what he was doing was wrong, but he is still a kid and he has good parents who I am sure will now pay closer attention to what their kids are doing online. And again I had many conversations with my son about this not being how friends treat each other. My son is the biggest kid in his class so I'm not worried about physical threats, but I was sure to explain that bullying comes in many forms and that what his friend was doing was in fact bullying, yeah Bullying Billy, sounds good. But I just can't say thank you enough for all of the support and awards, I was able to show my son just how many people cared about his situation and how this whole thing made it to the front page! Crazy crazy crazy! Thank you Reddit!Update: So I went to pick him up from school and he was doing great. He said yes his friend is mad at him but that he was still talking to him. Billy has lost his gaming, phone and internet privlages for 30 days and was made to apologise to my son. I was trying to keep my posting somewhat short so I didn't explain how much we talked about all of this. We go on nightly walks I took the time to explain that real friends don't this type of stuff and my son totally understands that. I haven't heard back yet from the mom but have no reason to think she won't follow through and pay us back. Thank you to all you that commented and wow! I have never received awards like this before! Thank you to all. And to people posting that why did I do this or saying I made a bad choice, I will just say that I've had many parents and people reply they have gone through similar stuff and that this post hit home with them, so that reason enough to me. Thank you again, everyone!My son (10) has been playing fortnite with his best friend for a couple years. For about a year and half of that time it was just the two of them playing and in the last 6 months more and more of their classmates have started to join in. My kids are with me every other week and on the weeks they are here I spend a good amount of time with them, chilling, doing homework, movies etc. I live with my gf and her 3 kids, so we spend a lot of time in the boys very large bedroom. About 3 months ago I started noticing my son being upset and found out that he was being ""kicked"" from the groups and at first I was concerned maybe he was being a dickhead or whatever.About 2 months back I was in their room and my son was playing with his friends and I heard him kind of begging and saying don't kick me and then he said ""I don't have vbucks to get you that skin"" and then he got kicked. I asked him what was going on and he downplayed it and I let it go. Since that point I've seen the same thing happen a few more times and I finally got him to open up to me and it turns out he has been being bullied by his friend for a long time into giving/gifting skins, emotes and other items. I explained to him that I got the vbucks for him to get stuff for himself and that I can't afford to be getting his friends stuff. He said he understood and said he would stop. It turns out that his friend has been doing this to all of his friends and he opened up to me that he had given this kid 20 plus items ranging from 1200-2000 vbucks, $12-20 each. So I've spent anywhere from $250-400 on this kid that I know of. I had written out a long text to the kids mom a couple weeks back and for some reason I decided not to send it. Well Tuesday, yep you guessed it, I was in the kids bedroom and I heard ""no Billy I don't have enough vbucks to get you that skin"" but then I heard ""you know what Billy, I've given you more than 20 things and you've given me 1"". He was of course kicked from the group. That was the last straw for and I guess for my son. It turns out that the other kids were giving this kid whatever he wanted and that was why my son often was the one who would get kicked.I told him I was going to be sending his friends mom a text explaining everything and I  also had some text messages with Billy saying ""if you buy me this skin I will re friend you"". He begged me not to send it but I obviously thought it was important enough that the mom needed to know what her kid was doing. She replied back in a very understanding way, apologizing to my son and to me and said she would be talking to her son yesterday after school. So my son didn't want to go to school today because he is worried about how things will be.So AITA? Or did I do the right thing? Hard to ruin a 5 yr best friend relationship and yes I see that this kid wasn't really being a best friend. Oddly I blame covid for bringing this on. For 6 months the only place they saw each other was online. And yes the mother has offered to reimburse us for the vbucks."

I am very successful in my career in a very male-oriented field with all the expectations and stigma that entails. I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years. He's not interested in getting married, and at this point that's fine. Everyone assumes this was my dream and that I'm happy but it couldn't be further from the truth. I know there are women who live for this and want to be where I am, and I applaud them for it. It's just not me. I wanted to be a wife and mother and have a just okay job or even just skills so that I could support me and my kids if something happened. I was overjoyed to get married when I was 24 and the happiest day of my life was the birth of my son. He died of cancer just after he turned one and my husband died a year later, leaving me a widow just before my 27th birthday. I've never been close to my family for reasons that have varied over the years. I have friends, but they got their own families and lives. I had nothing, except for my career. I threw myself into work and found the ability to rise. Having a woman on their team looked good for PR, and a woman that didn't have any ""pesky women things"" was their ideal. I finally started dating my boyfriend and we aren't using protection, but I am well aware that the clock is at midnight. He is close to his family, especially his sister. My boyfriend's sister, who is SAHM of 5, has been really pushing for a mentor to her 2 daughters for years, and finally got her chance to push me into talking to them. I've never wanted to because I'm not proud or happy of where or who I am. So when I was finally pushed into speaking, I told them this. Yes, women can and should pursue whatever career they want, but my ""success"" isn't because I had a dream and worked hard, it's because my life was so empty and painful that I needed something else to think about. I didn't want to be the ""high powered career woman"", it's just what I had to do. Being a CEO (not my job title) means nothing to me. Their mother tried to steer the conversion by suggesting that I wouldn't give it all away now that I have it though, but I didn't let her and clarified that I would give it all away to have a family of my own. Honestly, if it would bring me my late husband and a healthy version of my son back, I would quit my job tomorrow and forget the last 15 years. Now his entire family is mad at me for ""enforcing gender roles"" and making it seem like being a SAHM (which every woman in his family besides me are) is the only way for a woman to be happy. I wasn't saying that. They asked for my experience and I gave it."
691,Not the A-hole,AITA for hiding my personal life at work?,19077,d66v6a,3739,"I'm in a little trouble at work because I've been sort of hiding my personal life. I've worked in this office for about nine years, working my way up. I'm notoriously private and also believe in a clear separation of work and home life. With that, I never, ever talk about home life. I'm not ashamed of my life I just don't like to discuss it at work. My coworkers enjoy talking about their personal lives and often include me. If I'm asked any questions I usually redirect or move on to someone else. In this manner, none of my coworkers knew I'm married, have twin daughters and a very active personal life.We hired Melinda last year and she took it upon herself to become the office snoop. She spent several weeks getting as close to everyone as possible. However, she does this to seek out potentially useful information she can hold over peoples head. Try as she did, I never gave her anything. My coworkers view me as a sort of enigma. Compartmentalization aside, I've made some great friendships at work. There are more things to talk about than my husband and my kids. They are a big part of my life but I'm not even going to martyr myself and say they're the most important. They're hugely important and come before everything else but I'm not a sycophant and I enjoy the ten hours a day I'm at work when I get to be an adult and talk about things other than JoJo Siwa and the newest Jenndashian exploit.Last week, Friday, Melinda came into work looking like the cat who got the goldfish. At lunch she announced to everyone that I am married with two daughters, a dog, and a nice house. I play softball, I kayak, and occasionally mountain climb and that I'm on Facebook. She couldn't see my posts however some of my photos are shared with others and therefore not private. I use a shortened version of my name (Ali from Alexandra) and my married name on FB so I'm not sure how she found me, unless she used WhitePages and put two and two together. I've already reported her to HR.But the problem is, my coworkers are acting like this is a BFD. One of my friends said she's hurt that I don't trust any of them and hold them in ""such low regard"". I tried to explain that it's nothing against anyone, I just don't like discussing home at work and vice versa. I never bring work home. When I'm home that's time with my kids, or my dog, or my husband, or friends and hobbies. Heck, I chose to live an hour outside of the city in a small town just to avoid work when I'm not there. I've apologized if any feelings were hurt but my coworkers are now giving me the chill and won't talk to me unless it's directly about work. I honestly don't see the problem. I've never lied to them, I've never given them false info, I've never made up wild tales about my life. I'm still the same person I was, now they just know more about me than they did.AITA?ETA: I know this has been posted three times today. I didn't know Reddit was having trouble earlier with their servers and I thought it was the account I was posting from so I created a second throwaway and then a third because I never got confirmation the post was uploaded. I couldn't even get past the white screen with the little Reddit face spinning in the center. Those two posts actually have a little extra info in them. This one lacks the info because my patience wore thin.ETA:  I don't have any sort of interesting update. HR brought us both in yesterday afternoon and asked us WTF is going on. I presented my side, as detailed above, Melinda gave her's: she basically said that she had been trying to get to know everyone and she had been having trouble getting to know me so she found my facebook in effort to find something to talk about with me and then she just informed everyone else. I asked my HR rep to pull up facebook and do a cursory search for my real name. There were several. Then I asked him to search my married name, or the one I go by on FB, ""Ali Smith"". There were enough for about six or seven scrolls on the mousepad. In any case, too many to count. I haven't touched my own page since I reported the incident. It was about thirty names from the top but like I said, my profile pic is my dog, not me, so she would have had to look a each thumbnail photo or view each account. I do have an Instagram page that's on private but I only have a few friends, mostly family members, under that same name. She found me night before last and friended me. Naturally I blocked her. HR gave her a reprimand for creating a negative work atmosphere. My rep wasn't sure why Melinda felt the need to blast my info for everyone and he called BS on her for claiming it was innocent. So that's that. That's probably all that's gonna come from it because my coworkers are now acting mostly back to normal. However, I took the advice from this sub and I'm making amends. They're all most receptive. I'm gonna learn to open up but not by much. But they know enough about me to know I'm not an automaton or anything."
692,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting to participate in a “living funeral” for myself before I die this year?,19063,kp9i3p,1546,"I have a genetic condition and since the diagnosis, many years ago, it’s been all but certain I wouldn’t pass of natural causes. I’m in my mid 60s, I’ve had a great life and I’ve done all the big things I hoped to do, I’m dealing just fine and need no sympathy. Doctors confirmed a few months ago that the end stages had set in and I began making the arrangements. My family very badly wants me to participate in a thing called a “living funeral,” or “pre-funeral,” where you gather (on Zoom in this case) as though it is the actual funeral and give speeches and such but the subject (me) is still alive to witness it all They’ve put a lot of thought and care into the planning of the funeral ceremony and apparently seem to feel it would be much more therapeutic for them to do the main portion while I am still here. Even still, I... really just don’t want to do that. It sounds awful. It sounds emotionally devastating and like it would rip the peace I’ve made with everything I’m leaving behind right out from under me. My family is still pushing for this, especially because with the pandemic, it may be that a lot of people won’t have seen me in a year when I pass. They want to take the opportunity to give a forum to people to say what they need to say to me and make peace with me and commune with me and feel it won’t be nearly as cathartic if I am not there as it would be to do it while I am still alive. I could really benefit from some insight here. Because there’s a really valid argument that I’ll deal with the fallout of the pre-funeral for a few months at worst, and they’ll deal with the emotional fall out of not having had one for years. Am I the asshole for refusing to participate in this nice ceremony they’re trying to put together for me?Edit: clarified detailEdit 2: Wow. **THANK YOU SO MUCH** for the awards, and most of all, your kind words and personal stories. I had no idea this post would attract so much attention and it’s touched me so deeply. I’m very sorry I can’t respond to everyone individually, I’m actually on the internet very little these days. But I’m reading everything I can and really appreciate everyone who has taken their time. Thank you all."
693,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to change my daughters bedroom for my pregnant SIL?,19059,k5k7nt,2025,"My SIL (28) is visiting for Christmas and was sleeping in my daughters (16) bedroom. From the first day she's been here all she's done is complain about how my daughters bedroom is decorated.Her walls are black and she has a bunch of rock posters on her walls. My SIL is very Christian and she says that it's evil and that she can have no part in it. She kept asking me to make my daughter change it/take the posters down. I spoke to my daughter about it and she said that if her aunt doesn't like it then she doesn't have to sleep in there. I honestly agreed and didn't feel like fighting with an teenage girl over a poster.Anyways, right before bed last night I could hear my daughter kind of yelling and crying. When I went to see what had happened I saw that her aunt had taken all her stuff off of the walls and had ""accidentally"" ripped one of them which was signed by the artist. My daughter was freaking out and my SIL explained that the ""evil"" posters gave her anxiety and that when she got anxious the baby wouldn't stop kicking and she couldn't sleep.I told my daughter to tape the ripped poster back together and that she could put all of it back up in the morning. I told my SIL that if she didn't like it she could sleep on the couch or find a hotel.My wife doesn't like the way my daughters room is decorated either and of course she sided with her sister. She told my daughter that if she put them back up then she would rip them all up. She told me that she ""couldn't believe that I would suggest that her sister should leave"".AITA?"
694,Not the A-hole,"AITA if I don't donate all or even part of my inheritance (about $725,000)? My cousin say's it's ""blood money"" and claims she's donating 100% of her share.",19015,bvb2rz,3774,"Using a throwaway since money is involved here. Lots of background and doing my best to keep it under 3000 words. I was born in South Africa but emigrated when I was just a few months old so I am totally American. I come from a family of full on Apartheid supporters and when it ended, basically everyone bailed for America. My parents and aunts and uncles eventually were educated and came around but my grandparents, while being very sweet and loving to me, were true believers in what apartheid stood for. They made a small fortune in South Africa by literally investing and owning businesses in the apartheid era. To be totally fair, they also made a ton of money in the US, but still the money because they were white and well connected in South Africa. My grandmother died recently. She lived pretty lavishly up until the day she died in a very exclusive retirement home in SoCal so I figured there wouldn't be any money left and maybe I'd get some family heirlooms. My head about popped off when I saw the number me and my cousin will split (it's about $725,000 each). Money that will literally change my life. My parents business failed so I wasn't nearly as well off as my cousin. She's also now married, lives in Rancho Santa Fe (google it if you aren't familiar) and will be just fine without this money. She claims she's going to donate 100% of it to charities in South Africa. She is seriously chiding me that *if* I plan on keeping it, then I am taking advantage of blood money built on racism. I have student loans I could pay off, I could actually have a down payment on a house, I could invest, I mean...I know where this money came from but it could literally mean my life would be better. I understand where it came from but I also can't possibly imagine giving it away. I have no idea what charities are like in South Africa and family friends we have that still live there say that corruption has taken over everything from government to charities and I'm better off just keeping it. I understand my cousins point but man is it hard to say goodbye to that much money that will change my life."
695,Not the A-hole,AITA For walking out with my girls when my MIL excluded them from family photo album?,19005,kwk1a5,2940,"I'm 36-mother of two girls (9/5) I met my now fiance (38) 2.5 years ago. He's a good man, Treats my girls well and loves them. future mother in law is a generous lady truth be told. His family are respectful and helpful. We visit them a lot. After we got engaged I pretty much considered this my extended family. However my mother in law tends to do things that either intentionally or unintentionally hurt my feelings for example: when there's a family dinner at a restaurant we're not invited. On Christmas my girls didn't receive anything from her while other kids in the family got gifts and cards. Also all the kids in the family get a trip once a month but my girls never participate. Mother in law excuses were ""I forgot"".This week. My Future mother in law was doing family photo album and was gathering family pictures from everyone. SIL and her kids/brother in law and his kids and so on. She called and asked if I could send her some pictures. I thought that was nice of her. I sent them pretty much after my call with her ended.We were invited to her house. The entire family was there to look at the photo album bc it was complete. We took turns to look at it. And when it was mine and my girls turn I was stunned. Turned out she picked the pictures that had just me and her son. Not my girls. Although We took a ton of pictures. The 4 of usMy girls were excited wanting to see the album then asked why their pictures weren't there. I didn't even wanna think about how they'd feel. I was caught off guard otherwise I wouldn't have let them look at the album. I asked MIL why she excluded my girls and she didn't even reply she just ignored me. My fiance stared at me. I felt awful I got up, took my girls and walked out immediately. Everyone was confused. My fiancè followed us Then we leftAt home he told me that I really shouldn't have walked out before dinner and should've just ignored this whole thing because ""Who cares about a stupid photo album?"" I told him It's a symbol of family. the girls felt left out when all the kids pictures were there except for the girls although I sent her pics of 4 of us as a family.  He said his mom didn't mean it and promised that This will change once we get married And said he'll ""get everyone in line"" so I shouldn't even consider this a problem.And that my girls are the light of his life and that's the only thing that matters. And that I was overreacting over a photo album.Mother in law called and was upset Saying me walking out like that was disrespectful to the entire family. When i told her about what she did . She bluntly said ""I don't wanna lie to people those girls don't relate to me in any way"" She said she loves them/ treat them well. Will host their birthdays ""if I want"" but she won't call them family. I argued with her over this and I hung up on her since she didn't think she did anything wrong.Was I in the wrong? Did I overreact?"
696,Not the A-hole,AITA for using my mothers own threat against her and calling my brother a tattletale?,19001,jvbiso,1035,"I will turn 19 on Thanksgiving this year. My mother is extremely controlling. She doesn’t think your birthday should be celebrated if it falls on a holiday, so myself and my older sister (22F) who’s birthday is sometimes on Easter will sometimes not be acknowledged at all because “your birthday isn’t a holiday.” And she will kick people out if they wished us a happy birthday. It’s ridiculous. This isn’t even the most controlling thing she does.  If you get upset, you’re the problem and how dare you hurt her feelings? So my sister said she’d bring me a cupcake for my birthday that I could have after everyone left. My brother (13M) overheard and told my mother and she kicked up a big fuss about it. She called my sister and they got into an argument, and now my sister isn’t coming at all because my mother uninvited her.I miss my sister, so when she invited me to her place instead, I said yes. My brother tattled again and my mom tried to tell me I couldn’t go. My sister has offered me a room in her apartment and I’m really tempted to move. I told my mother I was going and she couldn’t stop me, and if she threatened to kick me out like she likes to do, I had somewhere to go so let me know if I need to start packing. She just sort of floundered for a minute before turning on the tears. I just walked away. She doesn’t want me to move because she needs my extra help with my brother, like driving him places and keeping an eye on him.My brother said I was being an asshole, but I told him if he wasn’t always such a tattletale this wouldn’t be a problem. I then shut the door in his face. My sister is thrilled I stood up for myself, but I got a call from my grandmother (who is also controlling) saying I’m being ridiculous and I owe everyone an apology. AITA here?**Update**: I want to thank everyone for their response. I really appreciate it, I am moving in with my sister this weekend. I’m packing little at a time, I don’t want to raise her suspicion or she’ll be awful until I leave or try and stop me. I already have my important documents, and will leave either Friday night or early Saturday morning.To address a few comments I got about my brother: He thinks it’s funny when she yells at me or my sister and consistently tries to get us in trouble because “he’s her good kid”.

697,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking my entire family out at 1 am on Christmas Eve after they showed up unannounced?,19002,kk0f3m,1361,"Merry Christmas everyone. Throwaway bc I don’t want family drama affiliated w my main account lmaoContext: I’m (29m) my husband is (27m) and we have a 2 year old son. I lost touch with my family in my early 20s after coming out. They reached out right after my son was born talking about joys of family and can we reconnect they wanna be grandparents and all. We’ve been very slowly building our relationship but they have no concept of boundaries so it’s not been going so well. That’s a long ass story. Only reason they call/visit now is to see baby and be salty to me. They live five hours away and they asked me to visit for family Christmas so they can see baby. I said no we are in a pandemic tf they said well can we come over and see baby I said .. no that’s the same thing. They showed up anyway w no notice. My mom, dad, sister, bil, brother, sil, their kids etc. Literally 9 people. Their plan was to stay over and have baby spend Christmas with his cousins to make memories. We live in a three bedroom house. Obviously fuck no for many reasons. They got here round 1am, I immediately was like leave. They said it’s snowing outside it’s night visibility is shit where will we go I said idc leave. There was a whole fit they made husband cry woke baby up then baby cried , talking about it’s Christmas Eve HELL ITS ALREADY CHRISTMAS NOW it’s family you can’t do this where will we go. I kicked them out anyway I had to threaten to call the cops which I admit was dramatic. Baby was up until 5 am after crying then dancing on our heads. I haven’t slept at all and guilt is setting in a bit because I keep thinking, where would they have gone there’s no hotels on Christmas are there, it was night it was snowing what if smth bad happened. But a part of me is also mad as hell. I keep going back and forth. Maybe it’s cos I haven’t slept at all.Edit: forgot to add. Part of reason I feel so bad is because they had young kids with them. And I don’t like my family but I don’t want something bad to happen to them. Might as well have sucked it up and kicked them out in the morning but , then again. Idk"
698,Not the A-hole,Aita For arguing with my fiancee and refusing to let her niece be the flower girl instead of my sister?,19001,jmb5dh,1952,"Mine (M23) and my fiancee's (F22) wedding is this month. Wedding planning has been literally a nightmare. Her mom keeps stomping boundaries and changes any plans we come up with to have a ""decent"" wedding and not let me ""ruin"" it and embarrass her.Her mom thinks I'm a kid she calls me ""son"" and it's so annoying and inappropriate. My fiancee is the youngest in the family and I'm the youngest son in law in the family that's why I got this nickname.Anyways. My fiancee and I already discussed and decided to have my 9 year old sister be the flower girl. She has mild cerebral palsy but she's functioning and does good at school. She's had people make comments about her and she's very sensitive so she'd get upset because of these inconsiderate people's comments.My sister's is on cloud nine ever since she was told she will be the flower girl. She got her dress and so far she's tried it on more than 5 times asking me when I'm going to have the wedding which is sweet. Thing is My fiancee came to tell me last week that we will be making changes in terms of menu/invitation cards because her mom recommended other things instead of what we agreed on. According to her mom I have no idea what a ""good decent wedding"" look like and wanted to save us (herself) from ""embarrassment"".I let it go. And didn't say anything. Because my fiancee told me these are small issues and that I needed to go with the flow. Okay no problem but to suggest that we picked the ""wrong"" girl to be the flower girl was the straw that broke the camel's back. She actually said she wasn't sure how my sister will behave at the wedding and that we shouldn't take chance and just pick her niece instead.I told her no not gonna happen. Like I gave my parents and my sister my word. no way I'm going to make her upset and sad and let the niece take her place. My fiancee threw a fit and said I was overreacting. That my sister still gets to wear her dress but sit with the crowd instead of walking down the aisle. We been arguing over this the whole week and I'm now supposed to call her and say okay but I refused and I'm standing my ground and wanting my sister to be the flower girl despite what others say because this offends me and my family.EDIT: People say that we can have more than one flower girl but my mother in law doesn't think my sister should even be included as one. She wants her sitting like a guest the whole time thinking she might ""misbehave"" where in fact my sister isn't like that at all. She's well-behaved and smart even better than other kids. My fiancee seems to agree since she wants me to say yes."
699,Not the A-hole,AITA: agreed to meet my dad to “reconcile” but I was really there to get my mom’s bracelet that he stole,18996,ltu9iq,783,"My dad and I (25M) aren’t close and I was never interested in having a relationship with him. He was the type of guy that was out all the time with his friends and never home.My mom divorced him when I was 12 and it got ugly. Some time during the divorce we came home and stuff was missing. Not his stuff btw because that was cleaned out when he left.One of the stuff missing was my moms bracelet that she kept in a small box under some stuff in the closet.This bracelet was super special to her. Her parents were toxic af but my mom was really close to her English teacher/mentor in highschool who was like a mom to her.Her teacher gave her that bracelet at her HS graduation and my mom kept it all these years. My dad knew she treasured it and who else would look in that specific place to take *only* a bracelet when there was other stuff in the house? She knew it was him too but he always played dumb. The divorce was finalized and we didn’t see my dad after that. My mom never got it back. Last June she got cov*d and didn’t make it. I was broken over that, still am I guess. Glad at least me, my sister and my stepdad have eachother for support.Around October my sister told me dad wants to talk to me so she gave him my number. He apologized for being a shit dad and asked if we could meet to talk at his place.I was ready to straight up say no but then I remembered he stole her bracelet and maybe this was a chance to get it back. I’ve asked my sister before to push him about it since they talk but she only asked him once and left it at that. I decided I could handle one visit just to see if he has it so I told him I’d “hear him out”.So yeah I met at his place. We caught up on stuff, he told me his sorry story about being immature and too focused on stuff that wasn’t important than being a dad or whatever.I ended up bringing up the bracelet and how important that was to me since my moms not here anymore. He still kept trying to act like it wasn’t him until I said the only way I’d consider having a father/son relationship is if he just stopped with that and gave me my moms bracelet.He finally gave in and thank god he actually kept it instead of throwing it out. He apologized for taking it and knew it was being super childish. I was just happy to have it back but mad my mom didn’t get it before she died. I never guaranteed my dad a relationship, I just said I’d consider it. But I already made up my mind I don’t want anything with him. It’s been months since our meeting and my sister is pissed because my dad is disappointed I haven’t talked to him. She says I was a huge piece of shit for making him think we’d reconcile. My only goal was getting the bracelet back and I wouldn’t have talked to him in the first place if it wasn’t for that so that’s why I wonder if I’m TA.My sis is biased here since was little when they split and has a different version of him."
700,Not the A-hole,AITA for being frustrated that my wife is angry about the sex of our baby?,18997,al1iag,1124,"My (24m) wife (24f) is 24 weeks pregnant with a baby boy. She made it very clear from even before she was pregnant that she really wanted a daughter, and she made the odd joke about ""sending it back"" if it was a boy. The jokes all seemed lighthearted and I just thought if she got pregnant and it was a boy she'd change her mind. Fast forward to our 20 week scan. We go in super excited and nervous. I don't mind about the gender, my wife is crying with excitement as she had a feeling it was a girl. We go in and find out we are having a boy. My wife immediately bursts into tears and I hold her hand, knowing immediately that she was disappointed and putting it down to the pregnancy hormones. She doesn't stop crying the whole day. I let her calm down and try to comfort her. It's been nearly four weeks now and she still cries when someone mentions the baby. She refuses to do anything to do with the nursery and won't discuss anything pregnancy related. Family are starting to think it's weird, but she said she doesn't want people to judge her for how she feels. Now that it's been nearly a month I'm starting to get a bit frustrated. It's just such an overreaction. I told her she needs to come to terms with this because the gender isn't going to change. She cried and called me an asshole. I told her she needs to get a grip. I felt awful but I feel like nearly a month of this is ridiculous. My wife and I made up but she's still acting the same and I'm getting upset again. AITA for being upset about this? I love the baby beyond words and am just upset she doesn't seem to anymore."
701,Not the A-hole,AITA for talking about things from the south when I moved to California that resulted in several coworkers calling me a racist and reporting to HR?,18990,lcoz8u,2528,"Throwaway here, I'll make this quick.me: 24m raised for most of my life in the southern us, politically middle of the road, probably lean a little left, half white, half Egyptian so light skinned (relevant later) think rami Malek.I moved from the southern us to Cali about 6 months ago, I have a pretty noticeable southern accent, I started work in my field (office job) when I got there. I moved for 2 reasons, job and I wanted to get away from the super conservative area I lived in. Office is pretty large and pretty diverse as far as racially. Now onto the story.Coworkers and I were discussing camping, was a fun talk until mosquitos were brought up, one coworker said something to the effect of ""I always get bit and itch for days, they are the worst"". I then said ""mosquitos are easy! We have chiggers and they are a million times worse if you get a bunch of them! (tiny bug makes you itch for days to weeks, its awful, they are all over the south). We finished the conversation and everyone went back to work.Next day I was pulled into HR with several of my coworkers to try and mediate an ""issue"". One black and one white coworker that were a part of the camping talk had reported me for being racist, they say any word near the n word is racist, and because I'm white I can't use that term as its so close. Chiggers are what EVERYONE calls them. I told my side of the story and also informed them I was half Egyptian (which I phrased as I was born in AFRICA to a white mom and Egyptian dad) which is relevant in a minute, here's where I may have been the asshole.HR basically said doesn't look like a problem (after googling the chiggers) and is a misunderstanding. I asked my coworkers if we couldn't throw the race card around and just because I'm light skinned and have a southern accent doesn't mean I'm a racist. They both basically started apologizing like crazy saying they didn't know, etc etc. Basically I pulled the race card asking them not to but I feel mine was justified? What do yall think?"
702,Not the A-hole,AITA For telling step-daughter she's the reason for divorce,18982,bnxeao,3095,"Yeah, I'm probably a major asshole here, but let me explain my reasoning.I came into her life 6 years ago when she was 11. Her father is still in her life and visits her frequently (at our house, not a problem though, he's a nice guy). Her mother is not happy. She hasn't been happy for a long time. Her daughter is one of the worst behaved kids I've ever seen, and it stresses my wife (we're not divorced yet) out every single day.She's made it no secret she hates me. I remember when she was 13 or 14, I paid for us to go to Disney land as a family vacation (cliche, I know). She refused to go unless it was just her and her mother. I was hurt, but since the trip was solely to make her happy and was largely paid for already, I went along with it and stayed home.Stuff like that is the norm. She'll demand her mother put her before me (**edit: as in excluding me from every family event**) and my wife can't put her foot down. She'll treat her mother like a maid and nothing more. It's not my wife's fault, she has emotional issues that make it hard for her. But it's ruined the marriage, because I've grown to resent coming home to be around my step-daughter. Anything I do to try to bond with her is met with resentment. Though, she's 17 now, so bonding is probably no longer a possibility.Anyway, my wife and I separated over this. It's just too much for me to bare. But I'm not mad at my wife, I'm sad that she has to put up with her daughters behaviour for the rest of her life.I decided to give my step-daughter a dose of reality and explain in no uncertain terms she is the reason for our divorce. I didn't do this to spite her, because frankly I'm ready to move on with my life. I did it so that she understands just how bloody selfish she is, and how much emotional pain she puts her poor mother through. I did it so she doesn't ruin her mother's future relationships like she did ours (she isn't moving out any time soon...)Wife and daughter's father are furious at me for telling their daughter this. Say it's going to emotionally scar her. But quite frankly, I think she needed to be told.AITA?"
703,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my in-laws into our home because that’s what BIL wanted?,18983,l6u2dm,1889,"My BIL Jason is 20 and 2 years ago he was in an accident that left him paralyzed. He’s bound to a wheelchair and barely has any hand mobility so he needs help with pretty much everything. My wife’s parents were hit hard by this and struggled with the pressure of taking care of him. Even though he receives benefits and compensation, in laws couldn’t “handle” all the doctors appointments, physical therapy sessions, and constantly caring for him.In the end Jason came to live with us. Her parents claimed they just needed a few weeks to take a break from caring for him. A few weeks turned into months until he stayed with us permanently.There was a lot of conflict over this. We couldn’t believe they’d just stop coming to see him all together when he was already in a dark place and adjusting to these permanent life changes. We didn’t speak with them for a long time. It was difficult to adjust at first but we’re glad he’s here with us. Before covid we had a care provider stay with him while we were at work but now that we’re home majority of the time we just take turns.He and I have gotten very close so we’ve had many talks about his feelings. I know how hard this is for him and how much it hurt when my in laws pulled out of his life.We haven’t had any contact with them at all in over a year. Well as it turns out, they want to see him again. My wife told me this could be the chance to finally get the family back together and to make amends. She’s talked this over with Jason but he wants nothing to do with them. He’s made it clear he doesn’t want to see them but she insists it’s important they all talk. Today they showed up unexpectedly when my wife was out. Jason was in the other room and apparently they arranged this meeting today with my wife but got there earlier than the agreed time. They just wanted to have a sit down with Jason but I didn’t let them set foot in the house. Honestly my anger got the best of me and I shut the door on them when they wouldn’t leave. I told Jason they were here, he didn’t want to speak with them. They left after 10 minutes. When my wife got home she was furious.She knows what they did was bad but this was the chance to make it better and Jason doesn’t know what’s best for himself because he’s still upset about what they did.We went back and forth on this. She said closing the door on them and refusing to let them see Jason was an asshole move but I feel his wishes should be respected. However she says his feelings on this are obviously clouded because of what happened and I prevented him from reconnecting with them in order to move on from the pain. So I’m not sure was i an asshole here?"
704,Not the A-hole,AITA for not paying for the meal?,18969,bf892b,1487,"On a road trip last week, my girlfriend and I stopped at a rural diner for brunch. We sat down and a waitress opened our menus before she put them on the table (that detail is important later). It was a very nice meal honestly. Our total was around $25. I was ready to pay with my debit card.The waitress then told us that this was a cash only establishment. Unfortunately I had zero cash on me. ""How were we supposed to know?"" I asked. She shows us some tiny text on the front of the menu. Because of the way she'd put our menus down and taken them away, we had not seen the front. There was literally no indication of their cash-only business other than that.She sighs and points to an ATM on the other side of the dining room. At this point I'm still apologetic so I went there with my card. I noticed it had a fee of, I shit you not, $9. I asked to speak to the manager. She brought the owner.I told the owner this is ridiculous. I suggested he let me go get cash from somewhere legit, or take $9 off the bill if he really wanted me to use that ATM. Nope. He threatened to call the police. I said go ahead. My girlfriend felt the same way. Long story short, the cops agreed with me, and we left without paying anything.I told my sister about this today. She thinks the cops were wrong and I was being an asshole. Because ""you wasted everyone's time over 9 fucking dollars."" I think the owner is the asshole. The only part I regret was not being able to tip the waitress.AITA?"
705,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my sister and parents that she can never live with me?,18951,jxmrg0,1691,"To start with I (26f) have never had a good relationship with my sister (32f). She didn't like having a younger sibling and had no interest in me. She moved out when she was 18 and ceased any contact with me, even going as far as rubbing it in my face how she never wanted to know me, by showing up for Christmas at grandparents houses and bringing gifts for our cousins but not me, and by showing up for their birthdays but not mine. The last time I was any way hopeful for us to have a relationship was at our youngest cousins 1st birthday party when I was 15. She brought along her friends and was mocking me for trying to talk to her when I saw her earlier at the party. So I hardened toward her that day and decided if she didn't want to be my sister then I would just need to accept that and move on from her.She got married when I was 17 and told our parents I was not welcome. Our parents tried to change her mind but she was not having it. I thought that was when they realized there was no way we were going to be buddies some day or even real family.And now they expect me to help her out. She got divorced from her husband four years ago, he got her into a lot of debt and then bailed. They have a 7 year old together. She lost her job recently and she got a new job in my city and then the rental she had planned to move into fell through and she ended up asking me to stay. I told her no. She went to our parents and the three put pressure on me. When I stood by my stance they paid for her to stay in a hotel for a while...She has not been able to secure a place and apparently lost the job due to a lack of actual address.They are all saying I turned my back on her and we should help family. I got really frustrated with all of them but especially my parents. She has NEVER wanted a single thing to do to me. She has purposely gone out of her way to hurt my feelings and make it clear I am nothing to her. But I'm supposed to help her out because she's a struggling single mom? After everything? With no apology or actual sign that she doesn't feel the same about me.Where my guilt is coming in to ask this is she has a daughter and I feel bad for her. But her daughter is also a stranger to me. I have never been part of her life and I don't even know if she knows who I am. But still, she's a kid and as a mom now I am wondering if I am being a total dick here like they seem to believe.AITA?Fixed the typo about her being the younger sibling. It's that she didn't like having one. Also want to add because it keeps coming up that more could have happened before I was born in the early years that I am not aware of. But all I have ever been told is she reacted negatively to having a sibling and that's all I've ever known from her. I can't say I know of anything that could have caused it."
706,Not the A-hole,AITA for banning my kids from my in-laws house because they keep forcing their religion on them?,18937,ic788f,1123,"I was born in Saudi Arabia. I escaped by convincing my parents I just wanted to visit family in Canada, and the moment I got the chance I sneaked out of my uncle's house and went straight to a women's shelter. They helped me apply for asylum. I am now a proud citizen of the Great White North, I even got a maple leaf tattoo the day after the paperwork was complete. I'll never forget the first time I bit into a pulled pork sandwich. I almost cried. It was like tasting freedom.I am now married to an incredible man with two kids (8M and 7F). He's also an ex-Muslim, but was born and raised in Canada. His parents are first-generation Pakistani, and well, they don't like me very much. They blame me for my husband's atheism, even though he's told them several times he was an atheist before we met.The biggest point of contention is how differently they treat our kids. One incident in particular that a caused a pretty big fight was when my kids told me their grandparents prevent my son from cleaning up after himself and make his sister do it. My husband reamed them pretty hard about this, so I was hoping they'd start to respect our boundaries, but yesterday I found something that really bothered me.We pay my SIL (16F) to babysit. Yesterday when I got home from work, I saw she'd forgotten to log out of her Facebook. I went to log her out, but then something caught my eye - it was a picture of my kids with their grandparents, my daughter wearing a hijab. I investigated further, and realized my in-laws were blocking me from seeing these pictures.It felt like steam was coming out of my ears. I understand to many Westerners it's just a piece of cloth, but to ex-Muslim women it's a symbol of our oppression, and I don't want my daughter wearing it until she's old enough to understand what it represents. If she decides to wear it as an adult I won't stop her, but for now, I don't want her wearing it.My husband and I made this crystal clear when they first bought my daughter a hijab, and we told them to return it. They tried to convince my daughter it was just for dress-up, and that just pissed me off more because they don't even let my SIL wear makeup. They don't care about dress-up, they care about brainwashing my kids.My husband and I banned the kids from his parents house, and now his whole extended family is sending us nasty messages. It looks like we're going to have to find a new babysitter, too, but that's a price I'm willing to pay to prevent my children from being brainwashed. Are we assholes?"
707,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to let my overweight friend ride my horse?,18931,gqgyqi,1619,"For background, i have 2 horses. Both are older (mid to late 20s), but one is very old (nearing 30), small (just above pony size and just under 1000 lbs) and has some back and hip issues. She is still in great shape for her age, is very muscular, and still enjoys riding. We trail ride up the mountains near our barn, usually 1.5-2 hours a ride, and they can be difficult and steep, but she does great with me (I am taller but weigh around 115 lbs). When I bring friends riding, they ride the smaller, older horse and I ride the younger one. This is because the younger horse is very sensitive and not beginner friendly whereas the older one is not sensitive and great for all levels of riding. Because of aforementioned issues, I am selective about who I let ride her as it’s difficult for her to carry too much weight, especially up the steep hills and for an extended period of time. I have a friend who is well over 200 lbs, does not know anything about horses, and asked to ride with me. I said no and was honest about why, but still offered for her to come groom them and spend time with them on the ground. She went straight to the body shaming tactic, I was skinny so I don’t understand, the horse is fine if she’s always galloping around with me, bigger people deserve to ride too, she’s shorter than me so it evens out, I’m gate keeping horses, etc. I just told her my horse was an animal with limitations, not a machine, and that I’m not going to sacrifice her welfare to spare her feelings. She was furious and we haven’t spoken since. Some friends (who all re also not into horses) think one ride would be fine and I’m being an asshole about her weight. I strongly disagree, I even agreed with her that bigger people can ride, they just need a horse suitable for their size and my horse is not that. So, AITA?Edit: thanks for all the responses guys! This happened a few months ago, but it does get brought up from timeTo time still so I was curious to see what this sub would think. I understand a similar story was posted not that long ago. That was not me, I just joined reddit this week and I’m sorry for the redundancy but I didn’t see that post beforehand.Edit 2: I love sharing my horses with my friends and wish I had bigger, younger horses so I could take everyone riding! I have many friends who have never ridden before because of weight, some are in great shape and still too big for her, some are overweight and too big for her. Those friends have enjoyed coming to visit and loving on them on the ground, and that invitation was extended to this friend as well. She’s not too big to ride in general, she would just need a horse suitable for her and unfortunately neither of mine fit the bill. Her size and other issues unfortunately severely limits who I can take riding."
708,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling somebody to clean up my trash and leaving the restaurant?,18926,cpfl0d,1602,"I was at chipotle for lunch today and I was sitting at a 2 person table by myself. I finished eating and went to get a refill, and 2 girls were sitting at my table. I told them that I was still sitting there since I still had 20 mins of lunch left. They pretty much ignored me and said “there’s no more open seats”. So I said fuck it and started to walk away when they said “are you gonna throw away your trash?” which I replied “it’s not my table” and left. AITA?"
709,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my wife she can’t have her dream job because I refuse to be burdened with all of her student debt?,18916,fixk8t,3583,"Throwaway.My wife and I married young, at 23, and now at 27 she’s about to graduate from law school. The issue is she has a ton of student debt, around 195k from both undergrad and now law school.But over the past year she’s completely changed her mind about law and becoming a lawyer. She now wants to teach and do Teach For America after graduating. She told me this past week. We’ve talked about this at length and she wants to do this because it’s her new dream job (previously it was law). I’m upset because if she teaches her starting salary will barely clear 35k in the first few years and we live in a really, really expensive city. She has no intention of going back into law later as well as she says law school was a mistake. Last night we were talking about the future and she mentioned our plans to have kids in a few years and how she’d like to be a stay at home mom in a few years as well. I looked at her and asked how she thinks we’re going to afford that when we’ve got nearly 200k in debt on my one income. She got mad and said I’m trying to use her debt to postpone major life events (like having kids). We ended up fighting and I told her she can’t just teach if she expects me to be saddled with her debt as a result. I said she should at least work a high paying job for a few years to repay a good portion. She said I’m prioritizing money over her happiness and that she’s disappointed in my lack of support when they would be my kids and my life as well.AITA to tell her that if she chooses to go down this path, I may need to rethink our marriage? I haven’t said anything like this yet but I am thinking it. Based on her timeline she’d only work for 3-4 years before becoming a homemaker. I’d have 200k worth of debt to work through completely on my own and I don’t know if I can do it or if it’ll completely ruin the rest of my life. AITA to say this?"
710,Not the A-hole,AITA for making an insurance claim against my neighbor for hitting my car even though my car is a beater?,18911,i0xbwa,865,"I have an old car that I bought for 2000 dollars when I was 16. I'm 26 now. In the time I've had it, I've learned a lot about car maintenance, I fix it up with junkyard parts and it's pretty cheap to keep running. It's dented and rusty as all hell but it goes and it's cheap.So anyway, my neighbor parks in his driveway and I park on the street. And he's gotten mad at me for parking in the street because he finds it harder to navigate his big truck around my car. I asked him if he wants me to move my car ahead a bit or behind a bit on the street, because I'm happy to, but I have to park somewhere on the street because I don't have a driveway or garage space. He didn't like that, he doesn't want me parking on the street at all. But I'm not about to park on a whole different street then I live at.Anyway, this week I was sitting on my fire escape reading a book and I saw my neighbor drive out his driveway right into my car's side. I grabbed my phone and started filming asap.I walked out to the car still filming and got a good video of the damage to the door panel. It was dented and scratched.Now my car was already pretty beat it's got body panels from 3 different cars, dents and dings all over, it's got damage to the convertible soft top that I've fixed up with glue and patches, etc. It's a tough old girl.So the new damage didn't bother me much, I didn't plan on fixing it. But it did bother me that my neighbor hit and run my car. Especially because he knew it belonged to me.So after a few days of thinking on it, I decided to file an insurance claim. I sent the company the video which had gotten my neighbors license plate in it. I thought they could find his insurance and settle.The insurance company said that for a hit and run the policy was that I needed to file a police report so I did. I wasn't expecting that much but I got a $1600 dollar payout from my neighbors insurance. I guess they appraised my car based on its estimated value based on model and year and didn't pay attention to the fact that it's an absolute beater with a lot of diy fixes. Anyway my neighbor is mad at me and came to my house after three insurance thing had paid out and he was looking to yell at me. But my landlord was there in the hallway doing some repairs and when he came looking for which door was mine, my landlord told him that if he wasn't invited to get the hell off his property. Guess he could tell this guy was angry and probably wasn't a good idea to send him up to my room.I feel a little bad that I hid lol. Feels cowardly. But it was also cowardly he did a hit and runAITA for taking a huge insurance payout on my beater car, because my neighbor hit it?"
711,Not the A-hole,AITA for not paying to fix the laptop my boyfriend broke in a temper tantrums?,18901,gvnqnm,1459,"I (M34) bought my boyfriend (M32) a 2018 Macbook Air on sale a few months ago because he needed a new computer. It did not come with a warranty. Two days ago, he got annoyed at me that I asked him to come to bed (it was 2am), slammed the laptop shut and came.Then, he discovered the next day that his slamming the laptop shut broke the screen. He started demanding that I pay for it because ""I provoked him"" and because I was so stupid to buy a laptop without a warranty. I told him he should learn not to have temper tantrums.He has a stable, salaried job. I understand that he doesn't want to pay to fix it, but I don't see how this is my problem."
712,Not the A-hole,AITA for not trying to reunite my daughters?,18889,johlrk,939,"I have two daughters Kay (26) and Layla (22), As a single mum I tried my best for both of them. But Layla, while I love her, makes it very hard to do so at times. She’s always been attention seeking, stubborn, and jealous. We did family therapy and individual therapy for years  after her dad passed away when she was 9 but something snapped in her.AITA part, when Kay was 22 (Layla 18 at the time) she had a boyfriend Mick (20), he seemed nice. Unfortunately Layla NEEDED all of his attention. It was constant, he’d be over at our house on couch watching a Movie with Kay and Layla had to be right there next to him. When they went out Layla chucked a fit if they didn’t invite her. She messaged him CONSTANTLY. She even went to his soccer games (skipping work at her job) when she hadn’t seen him in a while. Sending him pictures of herself, crying when I would ask her to get out Kay’s bedroom when they wanted to be alone.I tried to put my foot down when Kay complained, I had a talk with Layla about boundaries and managing jealousy and how maybe we should got back to therapy. She didn’t want to listen and she was cold. She started getting more secretive and Mick started withdrawing, it was then I walked in on them on the couch when I got home from work. I’ll be real, I was not calm, I screamed, the whole neighbourhood could probably hear, I banned him from the house. I threw her clothes at her and told her to get to her room, I called Kay and asked her to come home. Mick must have gotten to her before me she came home a mess. It was one of the worst days on my life after loosing my husband honestly, my daughter was devastated and it was my other daughter that did it. Once Kay calmed down she asked me to take her to my moms house and I did. When I got back I went to talk to Layla, she was sobbing, saying I ruined everything. That I hated her, that I was always ruining her life, that they were meant to be together, I held her despite wanting to scream some sense into her. When the dust settled we talked, she fought any sort of blame, accusing her sister of abusing Mick, of Kay keeping them apart. As gently as possible I told her that while Mick is awful, what she did is also terrible. She needed to apologise. She refused.That’s not even the half of it, but the relationship has been strained for the past few years. Kay has moved on and I am close with Kay and he’s husband, I’m careful to never talk about Layla and to be respectful of Kays boundaries. Layla however, begs for information about Kay, wants me to tell her everything, whines about how it was in the past, how she needs to get over it, I’m kinda ??? I just told her ‘what do you expect? You never apologised, what you did was wrong, I love you but I’m not the one to rebuild this relationship anymore, you’re not kids’.She didn’t like that, and while I feel like I’m respecting Kay’s boundaries, even my mom says I need to try harder to reunite them, so AITA?EDIT: for clarification on a few things, Kay asked to go her grandmothers after what happened. She couldn’t be in the same house as her sister, I couldn’t move Layla because she was locked up in her room. So Kay decided she needed to leave, this was in no way me dropping her off to comfort Layla. I got home at 1pm to find them and after Kay had come home soon after and I’d calmed her down she asked to spend some time at grandmas and I said yes, I was with her till 2am the next morning till she fell asleep between my mother and I. I left to go home, I checked on Layla, and I know I might be an AH, but she is my child too, she despite getting herself into this mess, was incredibly distressed. Maybe I was too gentile with her, maybe I should have yelled or gotten more angry. But In hindsight I don’t regret the decision to be there for both my daughters, when I looked at Kay I saw heart break and betrayal and when I saw Layla I saw a very scared, broken person. Kay made the decision to stay at her grandmothers, she did so for a little while, then I helped her move to her own place. I visited almost everyday, I went for dinners at her house. We had sleepovers, I went to doctors appointments with her, we started doing pottery together. I tried really hard to be good for her.Layla has not been out of therapy for more than a few months since she was 10. Her diagnosis has always been unclear, but she does suffer from OCD, PTSD from her fathers passing and anger issues from when I last had anything to do with her therapy. Obviously she’s an adult, if she’s learnt anymore about her condition she hasn’t shared it. Layla moved out just before she turned 20, the year and a bit after what happened was very hard. Between trying to hold her accountable and not ruin what I had with Kay it was difficult. And finally, I never claimed to be perfect, I suffered a lot with post natal depression after both my girls and while when Layla was younger she did show signs of being harsh and unkind at times, I was working two jobs with a terminally ill husband. Maybe I didn’t pay enough attention to her, maybe therapy should have started sooner, I feel like there’s so much I could do better. And I wish I’d had their dad with me to help us. But it was just me and I did what felt right at the time. All in all this has felt extremely cathartic, and I wanna say thank you to everyone who cared to read and comment. I think it’s time I talked to someone myself. You have all been wonderful."
713,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to stop having a relationship with my bio daughter because my girlfriend is uncomfortable?,18891,h95hn0,2208,"I’ve known my best friend Brenda since we were kids. I was the first person she came out to as a lesbian when we were in our senior year of highschool and fully supported her. She met her current wife in college and they got married 6 years later. When I was 27, they both talked to me about wanting to start a family. They asked if I would consider being their sperm donor because they wanted someone they trusted rather than a stranger and who’d be there when their child started to have questions about their donor.I was honored that they thought of me and agreed to do it. It felt good to help people I care about start their own family. We went through the whole process and a year later, Brenda gave birth to their daughter, Lucy (after Lucy Lawless of course, haha)Since she was born, I’ve always been present in her life and we have a great uncle/niece type relationship. The 3 of us have been happy with how things are and they’re glad I’m close with Lucy. She’s already been told of how she came into the world (w/o the full details) and while she knows I “helped” build their family, I’m still Uncle Steven to her. 3yrs after she was born, I began dating my girlfriend. I didn’t tell her about Lucy til 4 months in and it took her time to process this but she eventually came around.We’ve been together 3 years now and planning on getting married. Last week was Lucy’s 6th b-day and we both were at their house. After cake was cut, we all started taking pics. I told my gf to come so we both could get one with Lucy but she said no. Didn’t think nothing of it until I noticed she was distant and hardly interacting with anyone.We talked after we got home and she said she didn’t feel comfortable with me seeing Lucy anymore because it still felt weird that I donated sperm and now I’m playing a role in her life when donors don’t do that. This was a shock to me because she never brought it up before. When I said I wasn’t gonna stop, she got frustrated and it became a huge fight. She didn’t understand why I had to be in Lucy’s life and it felt unfair that she has to share me with someone who’s not my legal responsibility. At one point she asked if Brenda & I slept together and came up with this donor idea to cover the fact that I knocked her up, and that’s why I’m involved. I get we were both angry but asking that was out of line. I told her I’ll never cut off my relationship with them and left our apartment.She’s still been trying to convince me for days and to also consider her feelings in all this.  To her, it’s unreasonable to choose a kid that’ll never truly be mine over her: someone I can have a future and a family with. I feel bad that she feels this way, but it seems like she’s not being fair either. It’s been rough and I don’t know who’s right or wrong. She’s making me feel like the bad guy here and I need a neutral party’s help. AITA??"
714,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting to get rid of the anime body pillow that saved my marriage?,18886,jvtp2a,1816,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.My husband and I are best friends during the day. Love of my life. It's at night that's an issue. I'm a blanket stealer. I once yanked them so hard poor Hubby flipped a full 180. Hubby, for his part, is a thrasher. Bruce Lee would be jealous of the moves he pulls off while unconscious. It's a constant war between us when we fall asleep, and both of us often wake up sore and exhausted. It was starting to affect our relationship. Neither of us wanted to move to a separate bed because we like spending our nights together, but it seemed like an inevitability. We were both crabby every morning, and we started fighting as soon as we got up. It sucked, but neither of us wanted to concede defeat and move to the other bed.Quick background: I was a huge nerd as a teenager. Full on otaku (go ahead, cringe, I do too). One night as a joke, I brought down an old anime body pillow from the attic (I know, the cringe) and plopped it down between my husband and I, declaring it our demilitarized zone. Hubby also thought it was hilarious, and we named her DMZ-chan. She stayed there the whole night.It was a game changer. DMZ-chan protected me from Hubby's REM-induced rampages, and she's just heavy enough that I can't yank the blankets at full speed. DMZ-chan is now a beloved part of our nightly routine. We both thought it was the funniest thing, but she legitimately helped us solve the only real issue in our marriage.One day, MIL stopped by to pick something up. She got up to use the restroom, passing by our open bedroom door. You can guess what she saw. DMZ-chan, propped up in the middle of our bed, her giant soulful anime eyes looking right back at MIL. When she got back, she quickly grabbed her stuff and left, Hubby and I both confused. She later mentioned DMZ-chan to Hubby while they were on the phone, and it absolutely mortified him. As far as I know, MIL now thinks we're deviants in a three-way relationship with a body pillow. Hubby was too embarrassed to explain, and now he wants to put DMZ-chan back in the attic.I was upset. I told him I didn't want to go back to boxing each other at night, and that DMZ-chan helped us so much in that. He agreed, but suggested we get a normal, plain body pillow case to replace her. I felt like there was no need to spend money on something we already have, and if it really was that big of an issue, we can put her in the closet while we have company over. Hubby is firm in that she has to go permanently. I know he's embarrassed, but I feel we shouldn't have to compromise our inside jokes to appease other people. AITA?**Edit:** Sweet bees this blew up. Was not expecting all the attention. Just wanted to say thank you to everyone for chiming in. I admit I was being stubborn I drove over to Target on my lunch break and bought a new cover for 10 bucks. I put it on DMZ-chan as soon as I got home (to those asking, I did wash her after fishing her out of the attic), and am now waiting on Hubby to get home so I can apologize for making him uncomfortable. DMZ-chan shall live on in our hearts. And under the blanket when company's over."
715,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my husband I'll go back to work if he doesn't give me 50% of his earnings?,18879,j0pitv,1892,"I'm currently a SAHM. I never wanted to be one, but when I had my kid, it broke my heart when I could barely spend time with her due to my work. I wanted at least one parent to be with her  while she grows up, he wanted the same too. So I decided to quit my job. I had some savings, I could manage for a while. He told me he'd support us well. I was earning thrice as much as him, and our lifestyle would take a temporary hit, but we wouldn't be in trouble.When we both were working, we mostly split the chores 50/50, but now it became 100 me, and 0 him. I was taking care of the baby, the house, groceries, taxes, walking the dog, cleaning and watering, maintenance, etc. I was beyond exhausted. I asked him for help occasionally and he made a big show of doing it, said I'm not going to work anyway, so I should be doing all of this by myself with no help from him. I agree that I should be doing a lot, but not everything? He would act like he was a benevolent god if he washed one dish, and it was getting on my nerves. He wanted me to cook what he wanted whenever he wanted, learn to cook new things for him when he felt like it, to do his laundry and clean up after him constantly, which pissed me off. I also realized I was still paying for most of the household expenses from my savings, and he was barely contributing anything. So I told him that he's treating me like trash, like a live in maid, and I can't take being ignored and expected to serve him constantly. He told me this is what a SAHM should do. So I told him that unless he gives me 50% of his salary for household expenses and baby expenses and contributes at home at least 25%, I will go back to work.He threw a huge fit about it, and I called up my old job, who had been dying to have me back, and set up an interview (a formality honestly, they will take me back with no questions asked).He's sulking, saying I should be home with the baby. I'd rather continue to earn and come home to the baby than act as his butler.AITA? I really don't know."
716,Not the A-hole,AITA for screaming at my sister and telling her she is not actually pregnant.,18856,lu0ynw,2216,I (35F) am pregnant with my sisters (30F) child. My sister was has some fertility issues and is not able to have a safe pregnancy. I offered to carry the baby for her and her husband. I am now currently 6 1/2 months along and everything is going well.Once we found out I was pregnant my sister made the decision to live like she herself is the one pregnant. I found it odd but I didn’t see an issue with it. I understood that she is going through an emotional time. I mainly thought this was going to be something just between her and her husband. I was wrong and she has begun to act pregnant in her daily life. At first it was just small things like having her husband run out to get food she was “craving” but it developed into things like wearing maternity wear. She also gets annoyed if I talk about my cravings or pregnancy symptoms around her. These things don’t bother me much and I just think my sister wants to feel involved.Today my sister wanted to go shopping to look at baby things since the stores have reopened in our area. The day started with her getting angry whenever sales staff would talk to me. I would explain to the salespeople that my sister is the mother whenever it was needed. After a few stores we arrived at a baby retailer where she wanted to make a baby registry. By this point I was extremely tired and wanted to go home. I had told my sister this and she promised this would be the last store. I must have looked exhausted because as we were waiting the salesperson brought over a chair for me to sit while the registry paperwork was done. When she brought it over she did say something like “Here’s a chair for Mom”. I didn’t correct the salesperson this time and just sat down. My sister told me to get up and give her the chair after I had sat down. I asked her why and tried explaining that I was tired. My sister berated me by saying the sales person said the chair was for the mom and that she was supposed to sit. She said that this was her registry appointment and how dare I act like this was all about me. She said she was the one who was the expectant mother and that she needed to sit down now.I told my sister that yes she is going to be the mother but I am the one that is currently pregnant. I snapped at her that she is not actually pregnant and does not get how exhausting it can be. I told her I am trying my best to appease her but she is being ridiculous. My sister began to cry saying that I was shaming her for not being able to get pregnant and that I was making fun of her. I tried to defend myself and tell her that is not what I meant. She wouldn’t listen and ran out of the store. Everyone in the store was staring at us. They were looking at me like I was a complete monster after hearing what my sister said. My mother says that I should have just let my sister have the seat. I know this whole thing must seem so small and stupid because it’s about a chair. I don’t know if I am the asshole in this situation or not.
717,Not the A-hole,AITA For telling my entire family to leave when they berated me for paying for my friend's son's surgery?,18855,kkm4ig,1652,"I 37M had experienced 2 loses in a short period of time. I lost both my daughters (bio9/adopted14) both suffered from chronic conditions. I was a single dad dealing with so much. Soon as my oldest passed away. My youngest got sick in the same year. I had no time to grieve I found myself driving to the hospital again. Talking to doctors again. It was a difficult time. My youngest passed away a year later in 2018. My family started talking about how I needed to move on. My brother told me that I can rest now that I'm no longer spending time with doctors and worrying about my daughters and their issues. That hurt me even if he was trying to comfort me. My mom wanted me to get ""another chance"" to have kids but I ignored her My dad suggested that I move out of my house but I told him I was comfortable enough to sleep at my house since he thought I should run from memories.I'd spend most of the time by myself. I met a parent just like me in group therapy and we begun talking. He's a struggling dad with a sick child. I met his son Adam and he's such a sweet soul. They both begun visiting me. Adam reminded me of my daughters he is 16 and he's smart & empathetic. Hes a good cook for his age he cooked for us a lot and he brought books and would help care for my plants. He's at the hospital now.his dad and I spoke about the surgery he needed. Their need for money. I decided to help out by using my youngest daughter's emergency fund to pay for surgery. This gift is from my daughters to Adam. He couldn't believe it and started crying because they've been struggling to come up with the money for months and it also affected education. He stopped going to school for a year.I received a card from Adam. It's heartwarming. I haven't told my family but when they visited me my brother brought up that he needed money to renovate his house and how he has no money. Mom brought up my youngest daughter's emergency fund and asked me if I could help. I told them that I've already given the money to a close friend and paid for his son's surgery. They just stared at me. Then Mom and brother started yelling at me for doing that. That I was out of my mind to give away the money that was supposed to go to family who's struggling. They brought up how supportive they've been and I was ungrateful. My brother called me an asshole for handing people ""I barely knew"" money and not my own family. I told them to drop it or leave. They kept berating me and I yelled back at them and told them to leave my house. My dad called the same night saying I was out of line for treating them like that and that their reaction was understandable. He said I upset my family and doubled down by kicking them out.He wants to talk but I know him. he has short temper and will demand I take the money back."
718,Not the A-hole,Aita For telling my soon to be mother in-law if she wants kids she can adopt one,18848,km1tnx,1240,"I'm a 25 year old female, and I'm blind. The whole idea of having kids scares me, and I honestly don't want any and my fiance is also fine with this decision.Before Christmas my fiance and I went to see his mother, and aside from my parents they are the only other people we visit in person. While we were there, the subject of children came up which is usual for his mom. She actually naggs us about having kids quite a bit especially after we got engaged. While we were talking she asked me when I was going to have her a baby, I told her I didn't know because I don't want kids. Just like everyone else I've told this to, she tells me I don't mean that. then says I have to have her a grand baby. This of corse made my blood boil, and I planely told her that if she wanted a baby so badly she could adopt one. The'n my fiance spoke up and told her that we'd probably be more willing to have kids if people didn't nag us about it. Then I asked her if I had ""baby farm"" tattooed on my forehead. She says yes because I'm a woman and that's what I'm suppose to do. She doesn't care that I'm blind, and having a child would be a struggle for me, she just wants me to pump her out a grand child. Am I the asshole?"
719,Not the A-hole,"AITA for leaving my GF upstairs crying to play poker with ""the boys"" downstairs?",18842,fb0y6k,2133,"A little bit ago, it was my birthday, and my girlfriend had planned out a whole thing for me.Some background was that I totally *nailed* her last birthday.We spent the whole day doing her favorite things, had dinner at her favorite restaurant, got a big dessert of her favorite cake, and went back to my place to find... a huge surprise party.(Gonna go ahead and congratulate myself again because I totally fucking nailed it for her).I knew that she would try to top it for my birthday, but I really didn't want it.I don't like making a big deal of my birthday, so just having a beer with my friends is good enough.I also don't want to be mean, but she's really not that great at planning things.Unfortunately, she still decided to plan something.The first part was great.We went with some of our mutual friends (not my close friends, but good enough) to an escape room and had a great time.However, afterward, she got really upset when they left and started crying.When I asked why, it was because everyone had bailed on the second part of her plan: to go drinking on a raft in a nearby body of water.Now, I should say again that it's winter, and it was raining that day.The whole idea was pretty bad and *I* didn't want to do it (not that I said that, of course).We went back to my place, where I found out that my closest friends had planned a poker night for me.My GF tried arguing with them because she ""knows me better"", but I really wanted to play poker with them.Apparently she had known that they were planning this, and had tried to keep me away from my house because she wanted the day to be about ""us"".I was kinda pissed, even though she *had* spent a lot of time planning things for me and we had had fun at the escape room, so I comforted her for a bit, and went downstairs to play poker for the rest of the night.Now she and her friends are angry with me, because I ""abandoned"" her when she was upset. AITA?Edit: Clearing some things up:- That last bit in the paragraph about my girlfriend's birthday was a failed attempt at humor.Looks like it was a bit hit or miss in the comments, but it was dumb of me to write that.- My roommate let my friends in for poker.Big mystery solved.- This happened around 10 PM (as I've stated in the comments).I tried to get my girlfriend to play poker with everyone but she refused.- I guess I didn't say clearly, but I did talk about birthday plans with my girlfriend and asked that they be kept to a minimum."
720,Not the A-hole,AITA for ditching my date and causing a scene?,18840,c6a8ka,2372,"I’m 19F and my date was 25M, I was a regular client of a buddy of his who is a tattoo artist and he had seen me get tattooed by him once as he came to visit while I was half way through my session. I get an IG message from him, found it a bit odd as to how he would’ve found me since my page is super private, my username isn’t specific at all to my real name and I have 40 followers. He explains he’s so and so’s friend and we end up speaking and have great banter, we seem to really get along through text, it’s hard for me to keep up a consistent convo through text so I’m excited and we plan to meet up. We catch up to hang out and he offers me a drag from his spliff, I take a few drags and after a little while can tell it was a mistake. I smoke semi regularly but it hit me very differently this time around. We’re in his car driving around and he proceeds to ask me questions and we talk.I study justice so he’s telling me how he’s an ex con and is out on parole yet still engages in illegal activities, then goes on about how women lie about s*xual assault 99% of the time, that’s when I freak. he makes a comment about how high I am then jokes about robbing me and leaving me in a ditch, at this point I start to get really scared.He keeps asking if anyone knows I’m with him, who I live with, how much money I make & how much I have on me etc. Just weird questions. I was under the influence (big mistake) so my reaction IMO was much more extreme. I was scared and wanted to jump out of the car, the undertone of the convo was very off. My perception was exacerbated by drugs but safe to say I was genuinely scared.I hid my unease and tried to convince him to pull over somewhere so I could be around people and also so he wasn’t DUI, he didn’t want to and kept driving but after 20 mins of convincing him that I felt sick and needed to sit down, we pulled up to a restaurant.I get out of the car and start walking ahead of him up to the restaurant as he’s taking a phone call. I go up to 3 women and say as to not cause a scene “I’m really scared, can you help me and pretend to know me” they catch on and can see I’m upset. I sit with them, he catches up with me after his call and the women start telling him they know me and my mum wants me home, he says he’ll take me home but they are very firm. He addresses me quite angrily and asks “who does your mum think your with?” The owner gets aware and told him to leave and he ended up leaving. I felt guilty since I had gotten along with him and he’d taken the time to see me, I’m not 100% sure if I was in danger and if I could’ve stuck through it and left amicably instead of unintentionally causing a bit of a scene which was embarrassing not only for him but also me. I tried to have tact in the situation and didn’t have the confidence to be straight forward but wonder if in hindsight it would’ve been better to tell him I was uncomfortable and wanted to leave.Edit: Some of you are saying this is a validation post or would be better suited to other subreddits, I’m super new to reddit but thought that most predicaments are pretty much fair game for this subreddit? Correct me if I’m wrong please. I genuinely wanted to to know if my reaction was rude, if there’s something wrong with me for getting freaked out the way I did and if I’m the AHole for handling a bad date this way. I see that this isn’t as polarising as some other posts but unlike on here IRL I had very mixed and negative reactions. Hence why I got on here and despite all that, I do appreciate the support and validation (ngl) from people saying I did the right thing even though it didn’t necessarily feel like that in the moment."
721,Not the A-hole,AITA: I told my overweight coworker is she ate like me she would look like me.,18831,j3fpjz,2093,"Alright, throw away account, mostly because I’m at work and can't remember what my actual login is.I (25F) have been pretty skinny all my life. I eat healthy most of the time, exercise regularly, not consume my weight in PopTarts (a real problem in college). I also don't think I’m better than fat people. I think obesity is a complex issue and merely reducing the obesity epidemic to ‘Move More, Eat Less’ doesn’t take into account the socio-economic complexities, mental health issues, physical health issues, etc. I don’t make comments like ‘OMG I’m so fat’ when I eat a slice of cake. I don’t talk about going on diets. I don’t judge other people’s food choices. I don’t really care about what you eat.About 6 months ago, a coworker named “Diane” (40F) transferred to our office (we are “essential” so no work from home). She’s overweight and has constantly made remarks about my food choices. If I eat a salad, she’ll talk about how I have an eating disorder and promote toxic diet culture. She’ll say my body is ‘unnatural’ and ‘real women’ have curves. One time she even tried to make a case that the reason I’m still single is because men don’t find my skinny body attractive. Sometimes, though, she’ll do a complete 180. She’ll make remarks about how it ‘must be nice’ to be young with a metabolism like mine, or to have genetics that allow me to eat whatever I want without gaining an ounce. Lady, weren’t you just calling me anorexic yesterday because I had a salad for lunch? This constant harassment has really been getting to me. I feel like I can’t eat in the office anymore. I have tried to get this to stop. I have told her firmly to stop. I have told her politely to stop. I have ignored her. I even went to HR and was told this ‘wasn’t harassment’ so they ‘couldn’t do anything about it’.Well, this all came to a head today. Ever since my first job, I have brought in ‘Spoopy’ Rice Krispie treats on the first day of October. They’re just dyed orange and green with pumpkin and Frankenstein faces on them. I grabbed one and Diane said ‘I wish I could eat like you and still look like you.’I said, “If you ate like me you probably would look like me’ Grabbed another and walked back to my desk. Honestly, I didn’t feel like I was the asshole, until another co-worker said that what was extremely hurtful to Diane. When I pointed out that she had been bullying me since she got here, the co-worker told me it wasn’t the same. That it would be like using a racial slur against an African American bully. I went too far because I can’t possibly understand the discrimination overweight women face and I should have found another way to deal with it. I’ll admit, having never been fat myself, I don’t know the full extent of discrimination against fat people and I DO NOT want to stoop to the levels of bigots. But how else am I supposed to deal with this? So, random strangers on the internet, AITA?"
722,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting to share my son?,18824,c4p4b9,1421,"My son died at age 4. On the first mothers day after he died my husband got me a necklace with some of his ashes in. I wear it every single day.My Aunt is not someone I see often. She got on with my son but only really saw him a handful of times a year. She came a few times to see him when he was sick but not often. When we were told he didn't have long left I asked if she wanted to come and say goodbye and she said she was too busy with work. I figured she was in denial, maybe. I certainly was. She then missed his funeral to go to a concert.Her husband messaged me yesterday asking if he would be able to get some of our sons ashes so she can have some jewellery made. Apparently she asked him for one for her birthday as she really misses our son and wants to feel close to him. I said no because I want him to stay with us. All of him. Then my Aunt called me yesterday afternoon and said I was being selfish, he was her family too. I still said no. She said she acted the way she did when he died because she was struggling with it, and was in denial. But so was I. But it's been 3 years and she's hardly come to see any of us. She's not even met our newest baby yet who is 4 months old. So tell me, as my Aunt seems to think I am, am I being the asshole?"
723,Not the A-hole,AITA for going to a nice restaurant with my wife and sharing a meal?,18815,du19w9,3633,"My wife and I are not from the US but we have lived here for the last 2 years. On a friday or saturday once a month we will try a nice restaurant that we have not been to before in our city. However since we are not used to American portion sizes so we usually order much less food than what is considered normal.When we go to a restaurant we will usually order an appetizer and main course and share both. We will also usually have one or two glasses of wine each, or sometimes we will share a bottle if we feel like it. However occasionally when the appetizer is large we just share the appetizer instead of ordering a main course.Last night we went to a new restaurant that is considered a quite nice restaurant in the city ($20-30 per main course). When they brought out the appetizer it was very large so we shared it and we were definitely full so we didn't order a main course. We were also planning on having some wine later that night at home so we only had one glass of sparkling wine each.When we asked for the bill, the waiter was shocked. He asked if we wanted anything else and we kindly said no but that the appetizer was delicious. After around 5 minutes we still didn't get the bill, but after close to 10 minutes either the owner or manager (don't know who he was) came up to us and gave us the bill and he said something like ""this is a ~~full~~ full service restaurant, you cannot just come in here and order an appetizer and leave"". He gave us the bill and asked us to never come back to the restaurant.AITA here? This seems so foreign to me. We still ordered food and drinks, why are we less welcome than any other group? It shouldn't matter that it is a full service restaurant, people have different appetites.Edit: Sorry I could have worded the title better.Edit 2: Another mistake. It should have said full service, not full"
724,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting to give my new stepdaughter fine silverware that my mom promised to my daughter?,18806,f6rx0o,1606,"My mom passed away some years ago. She was by no means a rich lady but she held onto treasures in the way people from the old days did. She had a beautiful antique set of silverware that I admired as a little girl, and that my own daughter loved to look at when we went to visit my mom. My mom promised her she would have it one day. Before my mom passed she gifted the silverware to me on the proviso that it went to my daughter when she is old enough. Of course I agreed and it’s stayed in my home since since my daughter wants me to give them to her when she first buys her own home, so obviously a few years away still. Since my moms death life has changed for me- I remarried in 2018, my daughter is all grown up at 19, and I have inherited a lovely stepdaughter who is in her 30’s. She asked me if she could use the silverware for her wedding this past July, I was uneasy only because the thought of it being stolen etc was on my mind. However her ceremony was very small and intimate so ultimately I changed my mind after asking my daughter her thoughts since ultimately it’s her silverware. After her wedding she was asked me repeatedly if she can share the set of silverware with my daughter. She fell in love with it and now has sentimental value to her. I do like my stepdaughter but it’s not my gift to give away, I’m simply holding on to it for my daughter. I told her to ask my daughter, my daughter said no. She said it politely. My stepdaughter thinks I am excluding her because she should enjoy this also. I said it’s not my place or my gift to split. She thinks that I should ‘overrride’ my daughters opinion but I don’t think that’s fair either."
725,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking my pregnant sister-in-law out?,18803,ezwtj7,2227,"My brother (29M) and sister-in-law (SIL) (29F) asked Wednesday if they could come for a visit at that weekend. (They 6h away). We said sure, love to see you. Friday afternoon, I (34F) had an ultrasound for my 8 week pregnancy. The ultrasound showed a likely miscarriage. My husband (35M) & I were upset, but as my bro & SIL were already driving, we didn't cancel the visit. We hadn't told them about the pregnancy, nor had we told our 3 kids.When bro & SIL arrive they were excited to tell us SIL is pregnant, and due 2 weeks before I would have been due. I tried to sound excited and happy for them but I wasn't as excited as I normally would have been. Then it turned into a nightmare.She didn't like supper so we ordered in food for her. She needed the bed moved from 1 wall to another. Fine. She insisted on 5 pillows to sleep. I found a couple & she was upset I couldn't give her more & asked if she could go into the kids rooms and take theirs. I said no.Next morning, she freaked out at 7 am that the kids were eating cereal too loud. She spent the morning curled up on the couch complaining about morning sickness. I  sympathized and said it's awful, but it will go away. She screamed ""No, you've never experienced this- they gave me the same anti-nauseau drugs they give chemo patients so shut up!"" I got quiet. My husband was making brunch and she freaked out that he was going to cook bacon because ""the smell makes me vomit."" We didn't make bacon. She also didn't want us to make eggs or let the kids have syrup on their pancakes. I refused, so she stormed off into her room until mid- afternoon. Midafternoon she decides to go shopping and said they'd be back for dinner. We said dinner would be at 5:30. At 5:45 they hadn't show up, and weren't replying to texts, so we ate. They showed up at 6 and she freaked out that we hadn't waited so we ordered pizza. She spent the next two hours complaining about how brutal pregnancy is and how it sucks so much and how she's never going through it again. I lost it & told her that I was in the middle of a miscarriage and I'd love to have her problems because it means my baby would be ok. Everything got quiet and she looked at me and said ""I can't believe you'd use the ""M"" (miscarriage) word around me. That's bad luck, and if I lose the baby it's your fault!"" and went to her room and slammed the door. About 15 min later she said ""I'm glad you lost your baby. You already have 3, and if you had one right now, you'd just be trying to upstage me. I'm glad your baby is dead.""I burst into tears, and my husband told her to get out. He said ""I've watched you complain, whine and bitch all weekend. We stayed quiet about what was going on with us because we though you deserved a chance to enjoy sharing your news. But this is enough. Get out now.""She started screaming about how we are TA while my brother packed their stuff and they left. So, are my husband and I TA?"
726,Not the A-hole,AITA for demanding that my husband talk to a therapist and/or take parenting classes after he typed the word boundaries like BouNDaRiEs?,18790,k5y0t9,2118,"In case anyone isn't fluent in internet slang the weird random capitalization means to read it in a whiny voice.My husband and i have been having some problems in regards to how he parents our eight year old son. My husband likes to play rough, tickling, wrestling, poking at someone after being told to stop, and my son is a quiet introverted kid who hates that type of play. My husband also likes to do little pranks, mostly popping out and scaring people, but our son has asked him to stop.He also doesn't respect our son's limits in terms of social interaction. When we visit my in laws the house is very loud, the other kids play too hard, and our son does not enjoy it. He has asked to bring his switch and play upstairs. My husband said his mom would freak over how rude that was, so i tried to compromise on a book. My husband said no and that it is his job to put him in uncomfortable decisions so he can grow. I think it hurts his feelings that our son doesn't like his grandparents, but i find them very difficult to like, so i can't blame him. My in laws have complained (not in front of him) that our son is too weak and whimpy and we are ruining him.I texted my husband the other day that i want to talk about our differences in parenting, because I am not ok with him continuing to disregard boundaries. He replied that he has been depressed lately because of how joyless me and our son are, and he wrote back but find we can talk about BouNDaRiEs. I said that he sounds just like his shitty parents and I am not ok with that. I said he needs to talk to a therapist because i can't make him see how important boundaries are, or maybe take parenting clases. Now he is really mad at me and feels like i am saying he is totally horrible and the worst father.Edit- a lot of people seem to think that this is toxic masculinity, but I'm not sure because my husband and his three sisters were raised like this, and my MIL is the most vocal about disliking serious and  sensitive people, so I do think he would be the same if we had a daughter."
727,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I put a birthday hat on my neighbor's pumpkin?,18782,jk7q8j,851,"*Obligatory on mobile, apologies for any formatting issues...*I share a porch with one neighbor, who is notorious for not cleaning up after herself or her kids. For example, one time there was a broken longboard sitting right in front of their door that they would step over every day to get into their unit. For 7 months, they just ignored it, until one day I asked the oldest kid (15M) to please clean it up. He's a good kid and instantly threw it away. I told him thank you and that was that.Now, I know I could have cleaned it up myself, but I don't want to assume that they didn't want it (idk, maybe it had sentimental value??) Plus I constantly clean up the shared porch. Throwing away trash, picking up cigarette butts, sweeping, clearing cobwebs... I have known her to sweep the porch all of one time in the 6 years she has lived there. Last year (October 2019) I bought several small sugar pumpkins and placed them on my porch next to my jack-o-lanterns. After Halloween, I threw all of them away in an unused wooded area next to my apartment complex so they could decompose. The next day, I found one of the sugar pumpkins back on the porch - outside of her door. I know that it was one I had bought because of the particular markings on it. Ok, weird, but whatever, I'm glad someone is enjoying it. I figured she would throw it away after Thanksgiving. Then after Christmas. Then after new years. Well, it's now been a year and the pumpkin is still there. It is NASTY. It looks like it has practically melted into the porch. She has put Halloween decorations all around it, and still hasn't cleaned it up. I think it's gross, but left it there on principle, because I am tired of cleaning up after a grown woman. We work opposite shifts now, so I never see her. I also don't have her phone number because she is constantly changing it. I was thinking of leaving her a note asking her to please clean it up, but I'm worried it will somehow come across as rude.So, I think I might have a little fun with it... I'm considering putting one of those little pointy birthday hats on it and a sign saying ""Happy 1st Birthday!"" over it. Personally I think it would be hilarious and get the point across, but my husband thinks we should just suck it up and clean it up. Again, I don't want to do so out of principle. So Reddit, WIBTA if I celebrated the pumpkin's 1st birthday?EDIT:Holy guacamole, I can't keep up with the comments! Thanks everyone for the honest feedback, I have been laughing at all the amazing ideas for how I can address this. First and foremost - I hope this satisfies your appetites, you animals! [This]( is the infamous pumpkin. I included her flower pot for size comparison.Now, to answer a few questions:- We live in a condo complex with an HOA. Our units are owned by separate people, and I don't have a way to contact the owner of her unit. I also don't want to get any ""authorities"" or whatever like the HOA involved as I'm not trying to get her in trouble.- The kids are 17M and 15F the longboard incident was a few years ago.- The kids are not in danger or neglect that I can tell they are happy, healthy teenagers. I will not be calling CPS or DFS on her. She is a slob, yes, but she is not a hoarder (from what I can tell from the front door, at least, and her back balcony) and does not appear to have any debilitating mental illnesses. - Both my husband and I have talked to her in the past about keeping the shared space clean. This has not changed her behavior, and she is quick to blame the kids for not picking up after themselves, yet there has never been an issue when I have asked them to do so.- We don't have a bad relationship, but I wouldn't say we are friends. It's more just friendly chit chat when we run into each other in the parking lot. She is generally a pretty easy going person but tends to act immaturely for her age (and yes I know that putting a party hat on a pumpkin isn't exactly the pinnacle of maturity).- I am not out there cleaning religiously. Thank you for your concern about my supposed OCD, but I promise you, I'm not some sort of crazy neat freak by any means. I just feel that shared space should be kept clean and that functioning adults are fully capable of cleaning up after themselves. - It is possible that one of the kids or their friends put the pumpkin there. However, there is no possible way that the mom hasn't noticed it over the last year. You see it as soon as you come up the stairs.- It would not be possible to put a fence between our halves of the porch, because then they would not be able to access their unit. - The pumpkin doesn't smell (which tbh I don't understand how???) but it is unsightly. I have not noticed any insects or vermin thankfully. - My husband doesn't care enough to clean it up, he just thinks the whole thing is funny, although gross. However I know if I asked him to clean it up he would, but I'm not going to ask him to. - Why does it bother me so much? Well first off, it's not THAT big of a deal to me. I'm not going to die on a hill of pumpkins. I'm not simmering in rage every time I see gourds. I don't stay up late at night fantasizing about having a clean porch. I do fully acknowledge that this is clearly my problem, and that she obviously doesn't care about it, otherwise she would have cleaned it up by now. And on that note, if it bothered me to the extent that some commenters seem to think it does, then I would have just cleaned it up. But part of me is leaving it there just because I'm curious to see how long it will last before it decomposes into oblivion. Because science.This post has given me lots to think about in terms of conflict resolution. Honestly, I'm thinking I will probably just clean it up myself and then talk to her about it next time I see her (whenever that is...) because I'm not trying to cause any tension. But I'm also thinking I need to have a little photoshoot with the pumpkin to give it a proper send-off and birthday celebration. Stay tuned folks - I'll update in the next few days.EDIT 2:Click [here]( for the update, and [here ]( for pictures of the pumpkin's bday party."
728,Not the A-hole,AITA For Not Telling My GF Why I'm Tall?,18787,gusl5n,1622,"I'm M23 and my Gf is f24 we've been together for a year. Back when I was 18 I went abroad for uni and I started getting taller slowly at first, I was about 5'5 when I left and slowly after about 7 months I was 5'10. I went to the Dr in the country I was studying in and they assured me I was in puberty still and I'm just getting taller. I went home for the summer and everyone was surprised that I'm like a normal height now and it was nice being taller. I had no medical symptoms so didn't go to the Dr in my country since I was healthy. I was still growing slightly and I was around 6ft tall when I left back to go abroad for school in the fall.Once I got back to school I started having a lot of migraines and dizzyness etc. It was pretty mild so I stupidly ignored it for a few months but I was still growing and about 6'2 by the winter. I went to a large hospital near my uni instead and they gave me a brain scan and MRI and they discovered I had a smallish tumor on my pituitary glad and this was causing my symptoms and crazy height gain. The tumor was stimulating the gland to release high amounts of HGH. I flew back home ASAP and my parents took me to the hospital and thankfully it was benign and it was removed easily. So after all that I'm 6'3.5 after about 2 yrs of having this tumor while both my parents are 5'3. So I was destined to be short and all my kids probably were too.I met my GF last year and I basically have no health problems from it, I just go in for check ups on my hormones and a brain scan every 6 months. I told my GF that I had a brain tumor but it wasn't a big deal and she didn't care too much about it since we dealt with it. I didn't tell her it caused me to get tall because idk she never asked and none of my friends or family cared and no one talks about it.She found a picture of me at my prom and I looked really short and she was like wow you grew so much and I told her ya its because of that tumor I told you about. She was surprised and asked more about it so I non chalantly told her what happened and how I would have been 5'5 if it didn't.To my surprise she got mad and said that I was lying to her about my height and that if we had kids they would be short since everyone in my family is. Which is true my genes didn't change, my kids would probably also be short. Called me a huge asshole and has been distant with me for a couple of days.For context she's 5'6\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\*\*For everyone messaging me asking if my dick got bigger during this the answer is yes it did. But the doctors I saw all agree that it was because I was still in the latter stages of puberty still (late bloomer). But its still in the average range, just in the higher part of that range now lol. AITA?"
729,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving/ghosting my GF that was financially dependent on me without warning after discovering she cheated on me,18785,ba0ayr,4419,"**UPDATE:** I was not expecting to post an update so soon, but I was hit with a bombshell this afternoon.Over the weekend, both of our parents had tried to come talk to me. However I had simply ignored the knocks on the door and eventually they left. However of course they know that I can't avoid work. So they wait outside my house this afternoon to ambush me as I get home from work. With them is my girlfriend. They insist I talk to my girlfriend and I eventually relent and our parents leave.Once inside, she starts apologising and begging for forgiveness. Saying that our relationship is the best thing that ever happened to her, she will never forgive herself.... Basically everything that you'd expect a cheater to say....And then she gives the most ridiculous excuse I've ever heard. She says that a few weeks ago she found out she was pregnant, she started having conflicted feelings on if she was ready to settle down and start a family, and so she reached out to her ex for support. This emotional support quickly turned physicalThis makes NO sense. We have ALWAYS talked about having kids excitedly.She takes out two pregnancy tests showing positive results. She also takes out an unused one and says she can take it now if I don't believe her. So she takes it, and sure enough she's pregnant. She says it's 100% mine as she didn't cheat on me until after she got pregnant. I ask to see her phone. She reluctantly hands it over and, sure enough, she's been texting him non-stop since I threw her out.I tell her I need time to process this and ask her to wait outside. Once outside I lock the doors, unblock her on WhatsApp, and send her a long text. I'm reciting this by memory so I don't have to open WhatsApp and see her reply.>Whether you end up having this baby is entirely up to you. But you should know the following. First, if the child is mine, I will be a good father and take care of it, but you will never be anything more than the mother of my child. We will never get back together. The moment you cheated on me, our relationship was over for good. Secondly, I will not interact with you at all until the child is born. Don't reach out to me until then, I want nothing to do with you. Finally, I will not have ANY role in the kid's life - nor will I sign any birth certificate - until I get a paternity test. This child could have been the greatest blessing to our relationship and future, instead you turned them into an excuse to cheat. I will never forgive you for that.I have not read her reply, and don't intend to tonight. I also won't post any updates after this. I get the impression that the kid is probably mine, so I'm basically anchoured to her for the rest of my life now.---------------------------------**Original Post**----------------------------------------------------**With regards to the meta post:** I know I'm not an asshole for leaving her. I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.-------------------------My gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.Last week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.Anyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.So I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day (**edit: with landlord's permission**) while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.Anyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?**Edit2: The lease is also only in my name and she's never paid a dime of rent in the entire time she's been living here.**"

731,Not the A-hole,Aita: For leaving home after my husband said I was embarrassing him when I was crying?,18770,j8c9nc,1611,"I (28f) lost my brother after two years of fighting cancer, he was only 32 years old and he passed away three weeks ago, I feel so devastated and unable to think clearly, my brother and I were so close, even after I got married and moved out, I was the one who was by his side so I knew what he was going through.It's awful and unfair that he had to suffer and feel all this pain while he should've been living a good life, I spent time with him at the hospital, I was staying with him in his apartment to clean up and cook for him after he called me and told me he spent nights without dinner, he was in a rough condition and needed help,parents are both deceased, my dad's last words were that we needed to take care of each other.My husband would refuse to take meals over to my brother, never visited him, always complains that I pay too much attention to my brother and was negative and unsupportive.In the morning,When I received a call telling me that my brother passed away, I wanted him to drive me to the hospital because I was shaking and crying, almost fainting but he told me he needed to drink something first and acted so cold and didn't look affected by news.After the funeral, and I remember this moment specifically when I was with my aunt, we were both crying especially me, what happened really hit me at that moment, guests were standing around, my husband walked in and saw me sitting crying, he approached me and told me to get up because I was embarrassing him, he repeatedly said this, and  couldn't react right away but I blew up on him when we got home for what he said and called him inconsiderate and selfish, only caring about appearance, he yelled back at me saying that I was acting nuts at the funeral and he needed to act, criticized my aunt's and cousin's clothes and said he regreted even going, we argued for few minutes and then I went to my brother's apartment to calm down, the next day he tried to apologize and asked when I was coming home, and now he's livid that I'm still won't go home and is guilt trip me into coming home by talking about how much he cared about my brother and that he was ""affected"" by this loss as well."
732,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I sue my SIL for stealing my book and making a huge profit from it?,18734,is9p55,905,"**Unnecessary edit because there are just too many ugly messages**: To those who think this is fake because of incoherency, grammar, and structure it's why editors and proofreaders exist. They're hired to fix the manuscript before publishing. I didn't proofread this, and that's my fault. I like to write, but I'm not a professional writer. English is my second language. To those who think it's impossible to make lots of profit from a one-time self-published book with an unheard of author: SIL has a decent following. When her followers by the book, it climbs Amazon ranking, and that means it's more visible to other buyers interested in the same genre.I came here not for legal advice at first because I was struggling morally. I needed help, not to have people attack me in private messages and in the comments.**To those who only commented that this is fake or how I can't be a writer who fail at basic writing skills: if you do not have anything useful to say, please kindly keep your irrelevancy to yourself.**\*\*\*I (24f) write as a hobby, and I like sharing my short stories with my small following. I do want to publish one day, but I want to make it perfect first since it's not edited yet.The unfinished book we're talking about came from an idea that I started to build when I was in middle school. I just finished it last year, but because of the virus, I was forced to put that project aside to ensure steady employment with my day job.My brother and SIL came to visit me to introduce their baby daughter about 6 months ago. SIL just thrusted her baby into my arms even though I lack even the barest knowledge on how to hold a baby. The baby was fussy and my brother helped calm her down while SIL said she wanted to use to bathroom to pump breast milk.They left later and I didn't think anything of it until recently that I was told SIL had published a book, and it had been a while since she published. Self-publish is not as time-consuming as traditional publishing. I don't doubt my SIL's intelligence because she is a smart woman, but I've always heard how she dislikes books cause they're boring and drags on.I wanted to show my support and brought a copy only to realize it's way too similar to mine. I compared it to my copy of unpublished work it's obvious it's been edited and proofread for fluidity and clarity.I was angry and I admit I overreacted by confronting her over the phone. She said my screaming was upsetting her and hung up on me. It was a back and forth battle with phone numbers to get to the truth. By this time, my parents and her parents are involved."
733,Not the A-hole,AITA for forcing a special needs child off my child's soccer team because of the actions of her mother?,18721,f1adq7,1488,"My husband and I are 54 and 56. We've been married almost 39 years. Yes, we got married at 17 and 19. Our daughter was a surprise late in life pregnancy when I was 49. For some reason, I've always looked much younger than my age. I'm usually estimated to be in my early to mid thirties. Gets annoying at times now, but it's okay. My grandmother was the same way. My husband looks his age. I worry about the severe generation gap and finding friends with similarly aged kids, so I try to keep up with younger pop culture and technology.We signed our daughter up for soccer this year. We were at our daughter's soccer practice last Saturday, and a mom came up to me when my husband was off getting coffee. We talked, which went well. When my husband came back, she went stone cold and excused herself.All this week, this woman has launched a campaign against me and my entire family. She thinks my husband and I have a 30-40 year age difference, which is ""inappropriate"". She thinks our relationship is based on money (?!), that it ""sets a bad example for young girls"" and I especially should ""think about what my daughter is learning"". The team parents were starting to be against me, and I needed to respond.I was infuriated by all of this. I try to keep a mentality of ""age only means what you let it"" and care for my appearance and stay more modern, but I wouldn't think I'm trophy wife level. I sent a mass email with what I think is a toned down reaction to this woman's judgement and three things: my wedding announcement from 1981, my daughter birth announcement (which showed our ages), and a picture of me heavily pregnant, with my husband, at my 50th birthday party.The woman was humiliated in front of all of the parents on the team, so much so that she had to leave because they all refused to work with her at all. Her child has special needs, and this is one of the most inclusive teams. Many of the leagues around won't allow special needs children because they ""can't accommodate"". I feel bad that now her child can't experience sports, but maybe she earned it? We're not leaving this one because it is more accepting of non-traditional families and works best with our schedule. AITA?Edit: We married so young because we both had very...harsh homes and were in love (still are!). At the time, marriage meant automatic emancipation and you had better economic chances pairing up. We do have more money than most parents of young children because my husband and I are naturally not very fertile. We were essentially dual income no kids for over 30 years. We took an ""if it happens, it happens"" approach to kids and stopped preventing after we both had graduated college."
734,Not the A-hole,AITA for yelling at my husband for eating the wrong cookies?,18685,ggeoan,2319,"This is some petty ass nonsenseI(37F) made fancy cookies for a friend’s birthday this past week. The amount of planning that went into these cookies was silly TBH. Slowly but surely I collected the ingredients I needed through annoying ass grocery and amazon orders and miraculously had everything I needed to make these cookies on time for my BFF’s birthday.  Baking them was also a hassle - I had to bake them in small batches in order to correct the dough until I got the perfect cookie. So I’m running back and forth to the kitchen for hours while also taking care of my 10 month old son. I made extra cookies because my hubby has a sweet tooth. Hubby (38M) comes home from work and is super excited that I made cookies. I tell him how hard I’ve been working on these tricky ass cookies and tell him very specifically that there are 6 cookies that he must not eat that are perfect in size and shape and decoration and will be given to my BFF.  I TELL HIM THIS TWICE because I can’t stand the thought of having to deal with more cookie decorating. I even separated the ‘off limit’ cookies from the rest so it’s obvious which ones are not meant for him. He nods in acknowledgement. That evening he’s back and forth, in and out of the kitchen eating cookies (getting chocolate on the fucking sofa as he eats them) At some point I check on the perfect 6 gift cookies to see if the decorations have set and - what’s this?! One of the 6 quarantined cookies is missing! I asked hubby why he ate one of the special cookies and he laughed. ‘Oh honey the other cookies were too big and I just wanted one last small cookie’. I was only a little mad at first but kind of shocked.  ‘I told him ‘I can’t believe you just did that when I asked you not to twice! WTF dude?’His reaction ‘It’s not a big deal sweetie. Are you really going to get upset over a cookie? There are so many cookies left, just use one of the others. Or give her 5 instead of 6.’At that point I got a little more angry.  I told him that I wanted an apology and that he was being inconsiderate.  He rolled his eyes at me and apologized sarcastically and muttered that he would sleep on the couch tonight ‘because we’re arguing about cookies now.’ He said I was being immature for arguing with him about cookies. He gives me the silent treatment for the rest of the night and slept on the chocolate stained sofa. Now I’m fucking pissed and confused. Am I an asshole because I made a big deal out of this stupid cookie situation? TL:DR  my husband ate cookies that weren’t meant for him and then got mad at me for making a big deal out of it."
735,Not the A-hole,AITA for contesting an entire will to avoid a clause I didn't agree with?,18682,f7d1as,2303,"Using a throwaway. I am the only child of my parents. They set their will up to have me inherit about 70% of their estate, with the stipulation that I donate/tithe 10% of my portion to their church. My parents' siblings had the rest divided among them. Here's the thing: I don't view churches to be a worthy cause to give to in general. I actually view it to be unethical to make the churches richer while actual worthy causes suffer. Beyond that, that particular church had a horrible effect on my childhood that I'm still working through as an adult. I can't on moral or ethical grounds give money to my abusers. They had another clause where if someone contests the will, everyone's portion gets tied up in court and it's very possible that no-one gets anything. My case extended legal proceedings for almost 9 months longer than it would have been, but I was able to argue and win that the church could be substituted for any non profit charity. I chose Planned Parenthood, RAINN, and Saving Our Sisters, the three organizations that I felt best counteracted the religion I was raised in, and split 25% (15% extra) of my inheritance between them. I've been getting flak from all of my extended family, who say that I should have honoured my parents last wishes and not dragged everyone through months of court because I ""couldn't control my emotions"". I don't agree, and I honestly couldn't live with myself having given a single dime to a religious group or religious institution. I would have forfeited the entire thing if I had to to not do it.Edit: The legal proceedings have since ended. The reason that they set the will up that way was that they wanted me to personally have to sign the check to the church in an effort to draw me in. I didn't realize this wasn't obvious."
736,Not the A-hole,AITA thinking of leaving marriage because step-daughter got herself knocked up...,18677,bmywa5,5250,"Yeah, I know this sounds awful.My (32M) wife's (35F) daughter (16F) recently announced she is pregnant. She claims she doesn't know who the father is. I suspect she actually does and doesn't want to say, for whatever reason. I mean how much unprotected sex is a 16 year old really having? It can't be that hard to narrow it down for goodness sake.Anyway, moving on. She is adamant on keeping the baby. Abortion is out of the question apparently. Wife completely supports her decision and is excited about having her first grand kid. They're both ecstatic.The problem I have with this is:1. My wife's daughter is not going to be the one to look after this kid. She's still in school and fully intends to go to college. My wife and I will 100% end up looking after it.2. I am going to be the one paying tens of thousands of dollars to raise this kid. My wife works part time and makes very little money. I don't have a problem with this as it lets her do volunteer work that she enjoys, but it means the financial burden of this kid will be 100% on me.3. I wanted to have at least one kid with my wife. She's entering her late 30s so it's now or never. I feel like this kid will mean the two of us will never have our own because of both the emotional and financial burden raising it will put on us.I raised my concerns with my wife and her response was expected but disappointing. ""This isn't up to you. This is her decision to make. We will support her.""I agree it's her decision, but why do I have to support her?As it stands now, I'm thinking of cutting my losses and leaving the marriage if her daughter has this child. I'm not prepared to put off starting my own family for the sake of her daughter, nor am I prepared to pay to raise it.I fully intend to let them know this before the baby is born so they can make an informed decision on whether they can support it.AITA?"
737,Not the A-hole,AITA for bringing a really sassy doctor's note to school for a medical excemption?,18678,f1v41u,1924,"So my school made this dumb rule that nobody can have a water or drink bottle with them because a couple seniors got caught drinking vodka at school.The only exception is if you have a form signed by your doctor saying there's a medical reason you need it. And carry the note with you whenever you have a water bottle so you can show it to teachers or administration.Now, my doctor who i have my yearly checkup with is also one of my mom's best friends, and last week she and her daughter were coming around to hang out with our family.I was telling her and my mom about the school rule and they thought it was silly too. My doctor was talking about how unhealthy it was to not let kids drink water all day, and sell them sugary sodas at lunch I asked if she'd sign a doctor's note allowing me a water bottle and she said od course. So I printed out the form and she signed it. There was a section saying to describe the medical need and she wrote ""water is necessary for life"" which my  mom thought was funny but also thought might get the note rejected, like it was obviously meant for specific medical conditions or disabilities. But she said that if anyone had a problem with it, to have them call her and they'd get a piece of her mind.So I took the note to school and a bunch of teachers told me I couldn't have a water bottle and I said I had a note. Most of them didn't read it closely enough to see the reson but out of the two that did, one laughed about it and asked if it was real. I said it was, she could call the number on the form. She seemed satisfied.The other teacher threatened to take the note away, saying medical exemptions were not a joke, it was a disrespectful thing to do, disrespectful to the school's rules and disrespectful to people who had an actual medical need, to treat it as a joke.I know my doctor hadn't meant it as a joke about actual medical problems...AITA for bringing a sassy doctor's note to school? It said my medical need to be allowed to have a water bottle was ""water is necessary for life"""
738,Not the A-hole,AITA for Having Professional Hair and Makeup for a Wedding When the Bride Didn’t,18672,d6elil,2402,"Hi, y’all.My brother (m40) and his wife (f35) got married on Sunday. I (f22) am pretty close with my brother, but not his wife, so while I was a guest, I wasn’t in the bridal party. They got married at a somewhat local mansion, which is actually pretty affordable for a wedding venue. The dress code on the invitation was “formal.” For the three weddings I’ve been to with formal dress codes (and the eight I’ve been to semi-formal dress codes), the implication was always that it meant professional hair and makeup. That is how *my* whole family took the dress code, so we all coordinated appointments. A few of us actually went together and had a makeup artist from a few towns over come in, so my SIL could hire locally. Well, when we got there,  her family looked good, but their hair and makeup were clearly not professionally done. When her bridesmaids came out, it was apparent they hadn’t used a professional either, nor had she. It was kind of awkward in pictures, but I didn’t really see a big deal.Well, yesterday, I got a barrage of messages from the bridal party, her mother, and the bride herself about my family trying to “upstage her” and that sort of thing. Quite a few other relatives got the messages too, including my grandmomma. (FYI, my brother thought I looked pretty and didn’t see an issue except “when did you become a woman?”)I’ve tried explaining that it was a miscommunication, but they’re having none of it.

She’s always about eating the right foods, meal prep, fresh groceries, etc. Occasionally, my dad (52M), my siblings (21F, 20M, and 23M), and I like to get some junk food (we call these “junk-ups”) on the weekend. Now the problem: since forever, my stepmom has 1) told us that we’re going to die because we’re eating fatty foods (I promise, we only eat junk food on the weekends, or on special occasions, the last time i had anything unhealthy was my my sister’s birthday a few weeks ago) and 2) come in while we’re eating with a plate for herself and picks the foods she wants from each of our plates. Whenever me or one of my siblings questioned this she would tell us “you’re being disrespectful” , “shut up, I can eat what I want”, or “it would be a waste of time to buy me one because I don’t want one”. I want to make it clear that she does not buy any of the food for our junk-ups. Either I buy for everyone or one of my siblings do. Just yesterday, we decided to get burger. This time, I bought food and one of my siblings said “You know what? Get mom one too because you know she’ll just pick off of our plates anyways.” and my dad grumbled something about her not liking that but I didn’t care. I figured she would come around to us buying her a burger too, perhaps she felt excluded which was definitely not our intention. When we got home and set our plates to eat, in came my step mom with her own plate and before she could start picking, I put the wrapped burger on her plate and said “Here you go. That was ones all yours. No need to pick at our plates now.” She was infuriated with me and screamed at my dad to do something about me and went on and on about how I was being disrespectful towards her and that I needed to learn to share and that I’m too old to be selfish. I just sat there, unwrapped my burger, and ate. My siblings later told me that maybe we shouldn’t have done that because now my stepmom has been stewing about it for some time now. AITA?EDIT: I went to do my laundry and nap and when I came back, I saw that my post blew up! Thank you for your advice and the Reddit silver! To clarify some points made in the comments: With burgers or something that you can’t easily take a piece of, my stepmom would come in with a knife and fork and cut into it to get herself a slice. Also I don’t know if she has any mental illnesses. I’ve never asked. I think once she calms down we can talk. When we talk, I will update everyone! Thanks again!"
740,Not the A-hole,AITA for not giving my parents their son back?,18662,jjl38m,1302,"When I(26m) was 20 years old my mum and dad had a 1 year old son eddie, they were struggling in their marriage and had been for years. They thought having another baby would magically fix things but they were wrong as it just caused more problems and strained their finances. They were in over their heads and decided go give eddie up for adoption I begged them not to but they had made up their minds, social workers asked other family members if anyone would like to take eddie, both my older brothers refused and my grandparents were too old so I took my brother in. This royally annoyed my parents and I was threatened with disownedment but I didn't care as I already had a place of my own with an ex at that timeMy folks lost their paternal rights and I legally adopted my brother and I love him so much and was proud to be his daddy. My brothers didn't approve of me adopting him but I didn't care as they had never met him even when he was still with my parents. My grandparents helped me out a lot and were great. Unfortunately they have both passed since then and left me what money they had left to raise my bro. My folks and siblings were pissed but my aunt and uncles didn't care and thought it was best. At family events over the years my folks would be uncomfortable when I'd show up with Eddie but within the last year they had seemed to warm up a tad and I figured they themselves wanted to act more like grandparents as he is legally my son.During the last few months however I've noticed my parents and brothers try and talk to Eddie on their own about if he knows who his mummy and daddy is. He says I'm daddy and usually I walk in and scold them before the conversation can go much further than that. I've yet to tell him the truth and I know I have to one day but I don't think now is the right time and even if it was I should be the one to tell him.The other day I caught my mum trying to talk to Eddie about this again when she was visiting me, ed and my current partner. I asked my bf to take Eddie out for a bit where me and my mum got into an argument, she thinks I'm being a terrible parent and that its time she and my dad take Eddie back. I told her that there is no way I'm letting that happen so I kicked her out. Now my parents are threatening to sue for custody and my brothers agree while aunts and uncles say they support me no matter whatSo AITA?Edit: woah i expected a few replies at least not this many, I have decided that I'm going to tell him tomorrow. Have a me and him day and explain it the best I can and answer what I canEdit 2: okay so I told him, its half term here in the UK so he didn't have school. Around lunchtime I took him to get his favourite food, we then went for a walk in the park talking about family and stuff. Eventually we sat down and I told him about how I adopted him but I'm still daddy and that I still loved him but then I explained how I came to look after him. Its fair to say he didn't understand some things and has been a bit quieter than usual but he cuddled up to me while I was watching a film I loved when I was a kid and said ""I love you daddy"" when I put him to bed. I'm feeling better and I hope he does too, to say its been an emotional day is an understatement."
741,Not the A-hole,AITA for pointing out my colleague is divorced during discussion,18659,kbmzh9,1221,"So I was recently dragged into a conversation at work.A male and female coworker were talking across from me and I'm not sure how they got to this topic because I wasn't paying attention, but the male coworker asked if we thought it was okay for women to become a single mom through a sperm donor.Before I could say anything, my female coworker said she thought it was a bad idea since children need a mom and a dad.I asked her if she then also thought same-sex couples shouldn't have kids, to which she immediately replied they shouldn't and went on a rampage to defend her point.Now, I have multiple friends that are in a same-sex couple and some of them do have kids and they are amazing parents! So I pointed out that by her logic, she should not have kids either since she is newly divorced and that means her kids don't have a mom and dad available at all times either.Needless to say, this brought the discussion to a speedy halt.Some coworkers said IATA because she had a very bad divorce and still suffers from it, so I shouldn't have brought it up.I didn't mean to shame her because of getting divorced at all. Sometimes there is simply no other solution.I was just trying to point out that you could easily turn around her arguments against single parents or same-sex parents to reflect on her situation.So AITA?EDIT:Wow, this is my first time posting on here and did not expect this big of a reaction, but thank you all for your input!Looking back I could have chosen my words more carefully or opted out of the convo. I'll admit I can be a bit hotheaded if I feel strongly about a certain subject."
742,Not the A-hole,Aita for telling my brothers girlfriend the real reason my brother wants a paternity test because he’s telling her something else?,18639,iz3jir,1185,"My brother may be one of the dumbest people alive. I watch a lot of reality TV shows and last month I was watching episodes on YouTube of a show called Divorce Court and Paternity Court. My brother came into the living room while I was watching the latter and we started watching together. We had a mini competition to see if we could guess if the guy in question is or isn’t the father. He kept saying things like “The baby looks just like him! Look at the ears, nose, that’s his kid” and other things like that and when the results would come back that the guy isn’t the father he would be so shocked. Or if it was between two different men, he would choose the guy that he thought resembled the baby more and when it would be the other guys kid, he was awestruck. I explained to him that you can’t just go off facial features to determine paternity but it is a good indicator. That was like a month ago. My brothers girlfriend called my mom recently crying saying that my brother was having doubts that their five year old daughter is his and that for the past few weeks he’s been distant with the both of them. This was news to all of us. I called my brother and asked him what was up. He said that he just wants 100% proof his daughter is his. I asked him where this was coming from and he said no where. I said that my niece looks just like him and our family and then he said that I’m a hypocrite because I had told him you can’t go off looks to determine DNA. Then I put two and two together and realized this was stemming from us watching that paternity show! So because he kept guessing wrong, he thinks he was wrong in his daughter being his. I told him did his dumb ass tell that to his girlfriend and he admitted he told her that her ex called and said that he was sleeping with her right before she was meant to conceive so she gives into the test because he knows his reasoning is dumb. I hung up and called my sister in law to tell her to the real reason and my brother called me cussing me out because she refuses to take the test he ordered online and now is taking him to court for a court ordered test along with child support because she’s breaking up with him. He told me I ruined his life because now this DNA test comes with a cost of monthly child support when before she was willing to take the test to prove to him she wasn’t cheating."
