0,,AITA for telling my mom I’m not gonna be her second choice just because my brother died?,14810,m1ue66,1068,"Me (23M) and my mom don’t have the best relationship. My parents broke up when I was 2. My mom was trying to do college so I was mostly with my dad and she’d have me every weekend. When I was 6 she got married and then a year later had my half brother “Tommy.”  After that she was cancelling our meetups or days I go over there because she was busy. Missing out on school stuff and then birthdays. I barely saw her after that and her reason always was being busy with my half bro. I never even met him. Like at all. I could also tell when I was around her husband didn’t like me. He was always serious around me and never actually spoke to me. Years went on and it just went to total no talking at all.My dad got married to my stepmom when I was 10 and she’s really great. So 9 months ago I heard from my grandparents on Facebook that Tommy passed. Idk the full details all I know it was some accident and he had serious injuries.Thought about reaching out to my mom but it felt weird since we haven’t talked in years.She ended up the one messaging me. First telling me about what happened to Tommy and then apologizing for not keeping contact with me for years.Pretty much she wants to meet and for us to have a relationship again. It just felt off to me that she’s doing it only now after Tommy passed. I know some of u are gonna say losing him maybe made her realize she was a shit mom to me, but still.If this hadn’t happened then it’s like she never would’ve reached out and wouldn’t be trying.I told her this too and I’m not interested in us having anything atm. This made her push even more that we *need* to do this and it just seemed like she was not gonna let this go.So I said I’m sorry for what happened to him but I’m not gonna be her 2nd choice. And she can’t expect me to want her back in just because she lost one child and decided she’ll go back to the other.Maybe in the future if I feel differently but not right now. My mom hasn’t left me alone and when last time I talked to my grandparents they gave me shit about what I told her and I shouldn’t have said that to her after she’s lost her son. So I’m not sure if what I said was too harsh. Saying I’m not interested in her right now just because my brother’s not around anymore and it’s like I’m just her only option now. It’s just how I feel since she dropped out of my life once she had another family.was I an asshole?"
1,,AITA for refusing to be more modest around my step-son?,829,m1z3a2,256,"I (35F) met my husband (43M) eight years ago. We fell in love hard and got married a year later. My step-son was 6 years old at the time. I pretty much raised him since his mother has always been out of the picture, and even though he doesn't call me mom we have a great relationship. Ever since my step-son (14M) hit puberty, my husband started commenting on my clothes and asking me to not wear a two-piece bikini around my step-son . He justified it by explaining that in his culture ""He's from a Muslim Arab country"" you should dress modestly around non family members. I was very offended since I consider him my son and I raised him since he was six years old. I dressed him, made him breakfast and took him to school everyday. I read him bedtime stories and tucked him in bed. Last night I was online shopping while me and my husband were laying in bed. When I started browsing through bikini's, my husband asked me to not purchase any two-piece bikinis since it's inappropriate in his opinion. I went off on him and told him that he's the one being inappropriate and weird and that his son is also my son. We argued for an hour and ended up leaving the house. He sent me a text later telling me that he's very upset with me for not respecting his culture and religion. Am I the asshole for refusing to be more modest?INFO: my husband is not a Muslim. He left the religion 15 years ago."
2,,AITA for proving my mom was being a hypocrite,12191,m1ocmc,695,My mom is very different with my sister (16) and me (15F). My sister is a DD and has curves and a butt and I’m a freaking rectangle and look like a 10 year old boy. Whenever my sister wears a v neck or low cut shirt or shorts that don’t go down to her fingertips our mom calls her a whore and trashy and says that she needs to start respecting herself and not keep trying to get boy’s attention. I can wear whatever the hell I want and she won’t give a damn. I bought a crop top that was barely longer than my bra and a skirt that barely covered my ass and my mom complimented my outfit. Then my sister walked out in shorts and a tee shirt and my mom called her a slut. It’s starting to get warm so my sister and I started taking out our summer clothes a little early and my mom has been on my sister’s ass again. So my sister and I decided to go shopping and we bought the exact same shirt and shorts (flight my cropped pink short sleeve tee shirt and some regular black shorts) and agreed to wear them the next day to see what my mom would do. This morning we walked out of our rooms and my mom complimented my outfit and said that I look cute and suggested a makeup look that I do a lot to match it. Then she looked at my sister and called her a slut and said nobody’s going to respect her if she keeps showing off her body. My sister pointed out that I was wearing the same outfit and my mom said “that can’t be possible. Hers is so much less trashy” so my sister and I pulled out the receipts that showed that they were the same shirt and shorts. My mom stormed off and won’t talk to us and our dad thinks she deserved it but we should apologize to keep the peace so we wanted to know if we were being assholes
3,,AITA for not changing the theme so my niece can attend my bachelorette party?,3447,m1pi34,512,"I (29) have 2 older sisters (K & N), both in their 30s, both married with kids. I love my nieces and nephews to bits and they’re all going to be apart of my wedding in some form, with my 13 year old niece (N’s oldest) is a junior bridesmaid.Before I got engaged, I knew I wanted a Vegas bachelorette party. Call me cliche, I just wanted to go, gamble for fun, see a show and have a great time with my friends and sisters. I’m getting married in the fall and we’ve planned on my bachelorette for the summer. For obvious reasons, we can’t travel there. But K and my maid of honor got the great idea of turning K’s house into mini Vegas. They found tiny, plastic slot machines, will make tables for card games. Her house already has a bar, so we could use that. They said we’ll all dress how we would for a night in Vegas and we’ll have Vegas themed movies on in the background. It sounds like a lot of fun. K also assumed I’d want it to be a kid free event (I love kids, want my own some day but this is clearly a pretty adult party, some of my friends want to bring some nsfw treats and others will for sure bring weed-which is legal in our area) and her husband is bringing their kids to his parents for the night. I thanked her and agreed, no kids.N was fine with her younger two not coming but apparently my eldest niece has been looking toward to this bachelorette party. When I asked her to be in the wedding, she looked up the experience and saw there was a “fun party”, in her words. N says we should make the event “teen friendly”, as she’s part of the “adult wedding party”. I pointed out she was invited to my engagement party and she’s invited to the rehearsal dinner along with the sleepover I’m doing the night before with my bridal party. Plus, she’s been dress shopping with me and I took her one on one to get her dress. We spend a ton of time together. I’d like one night with just the adults where we can drink, not censor ourselves and do a few traditional bachelorette things. I offered to do something with her the night before but N says my niece wants to come. K backed me up and told N to tell my niece that some things are just for adults. N was frustrated but finally agreed.My niece is now pretty cold towards me and despite me explaining, called me mean. I pointed out that her sisters and cousins (who are 11, 10, 8 and 5) aren’t going to be there but she claims they’re babies. I’ve offered multiple times to do something fun with her the night before and am basically told it’s not the same.Am I being an ass?"
4,,"AITA for not making amends with a coworker who freaked out when I told him that calling me ""little Suzy"" was inappropriate?",1539,m1sm0k,223,"I am a petite woman (this is relevant) and I work in a professional office. I use the long form of my name at work (think Suzanne instead of Suzy) and my shortened name among my friends and family only. I get along well with most of my coworkers.I have one coworker, let's call him George, who is ""that guy"". No concept of personal space (pre-covid as well as during covid), interrupts others while they are working on stuff, walks into others' offices uninvited, etc. We quietly tolerate him in the hopes that he decides to retire in the next few years.George insists on calling me by my shortened name (think Suzy) even though I never use that name at work. None of my other coworkers call me Suzy. George also interrupts me for no good reason and gets in my personal space. If I back up, he takes one step forward. He takes it upon himself to walk around behind my workstation so that he looms over me while saying whatever inane thing crosses his mind, all while I'm trying to focus on the task at hand. He interrupts me when I'm giving instructions to staff because he thought it was a social conversation (it was not). These are recurring problems.A while back, George saw me and said ""hey little Suzy"" in front of some of the staff. After taking his crap for what was literally years, I couldn't handle it anymore. I told him that it was inappropriate to call me ""little Suzy"", full stop. I said he should not use the diminutive to refer to me, and he shouldn't comment on my size because I can't help that my body is petite. I told him that he wouldn't like me to call him ""big George"".George freaked out and yelled that he was ""only trying to say hello"". I countered that he was NOT ""just trying to say hello"" - because any normal person could just say ""hello"" and not insert weird adjectives into the conversation. At that point George stormed off in a huff and threw back one hand as though he was swatting away a fly.It has been months since this incident and whenever I see George in passing, he refuses to speak to me or make eye contact. If he sees me he will quickly avert his eyes to the ground. To be honest, this has brought me some peace after YEARS of weird comments and invasion of personal space that I endured.  I think that the apology should come from him, but I don't think that will happen. I think that George believes that I'm the asshole for attacking him for ""just saying hello"" to me, and that I'm an unreasonable b\*tch.However, I'm not the type of person who likes ongoing interpersonal conflict especially when it's over something so stupid. I am wondering if I should reach out to him and address what happened so that we can move forward without the ongoing wordless avoidance. It really does feel awkward.So, am I the asshole for telling him off about saying ""hello little Suzy"" and then not taking any steps to make amends with him? Should I have waited until the moment had passed and then spoken to him in private about how his choice of words affected me? Is it even possible to address this now that it's months later and we haven't been speaking?"
5,,AITA for refusing to look after my daughter and telling my husband it was his problem to find babysitting.,5218,m1n3ff,465,"I (35 F) changed industries at the beginning of this year, and moved from a job where I worked 9 days a fortnight to working 5 days every week.Prior to this, my husband (36M) and I had been alternating spending a day during the week looking after our 1 year old daughter. I told him that I wouldn't be able to do this anymore, as I was now working full time, and we should consider either a nanny or an extra day of childcare, but he said that his mother wouldn't like it, and he'd figure something out. Well, it turns out that the thing he figured out was that I'd be able to start work from home for a few days a week after I'd been at the new job for a few months. So a couple of weeks ago, he went in for work on the day we didn't have childcare, and made me look after the baby. After this, I said this couldn't be relied on for this, because work from home means work from home. It doesn't mean work from home while dealing with a 1 year old. The advantage of WFH was the lack of commute.Anyway, this Friday after work, he tells me that he needs me to look after the baby on Monday while he goes and trains a new employee. I said it doesn't work for me, as I have work, and I have a client meeting that morning, so I don't have that much flexibility. He told me it was not feasible for him to take every Monday off, and I had to do it sometimes, and I was like, well, I can't. He then asked me what would make me happy. And I said that what would make me happy was going back in time and listening to me when I said we should arrange an extra day of childcare, and it was his decision not to do that, so he should figure out what to do with the baby and stop making it my problem.My husband was furious with me, because he thinks I'm not trying to make any compromises, and an putting my career before his. The way I see it, he's not taking my career seriously and is jeapordising my reputation for reliability while I'm still in my probation phase in a new job and new industry. My husband works for his parents, and has for most of his life, so I don't think he realises what the norms are for normal employment.So, AITA?"
6,,AITA for telling my parents it's their fault my sister and I don't have a relationship and they should reflect on their failings as parents?,305,m20x9v,98,"I (24f) was spoiled by my parents in early childhood. I got everything I wanted and had little to no boundaries. I was also the youngest of two. My sister is four years older than me and was treated pretty badly by our parents. Her toys were given to me if I even looked at them as a toddler. My favorite foods were chosen over hers. I got to take her blankets and clothes and other stuff. This was until maybe I was 6 and honestly the only reason it probably stopped is my taste changed a lot. But my parents never considered what that would do to our relationship.Spoiler alert: It made her resent me, hate me even. And today at 24 and 28 years old we have not spoken in 10 years. I have not seen her in 6 years. The last piece of communication we had she told me she never wanted to hear or speak to me again.My parents have never understood and honestly it pisses me off. I am very detached from them because I know they ruined any chance I ever had at having a sister relationship with mine. They also could have turned me into a pretty shitty person. Which I hate thinking about. I can't even blame my sister for how she feels because I would imagine it's hard even as an adult to figure all that out when you were always the scape goat of the family.I last spoke to my parents a month and a half ago and they were going on and on about my sisters and my relationship or lack thereof and how they could not understand why we wouldn't even try to get along and I couldn't believe it. So I told them they should look at their failings as parents and the blame they have in all of this. They were shocked. I told them they fucked things up and they still don't get why. They said I was rude.My uncle, who I'm close to, said he understood saying what I did but could have handled it better.AITA?"
7,,AITA for refusing to cook using an induction stove?,1688,m1r7lz,426,"At the start of 2021, my husband (who does not cook) replaced our electric range stove and bought a portable induction cooktop, without asking me about it. I told him I do not prefer induction. I asked my husband if we could buy a new electric stove instead, but he said no. He insisted that the induction is for our safety (we are in our early 60's) and that as technology improves, we should move forward as well. He explained that the induction was faster and energy efficient. I had no choice so we put away my collection of pots/pans and bought new ones which were magnetic. I tried to cook on the induction but there were so many problems. Overall, it felt like it took forever to cook a meal, which would still turn out bad. Everyday I felt miserable. I told my husband and he just said that I have to adapt to it. That it's a learning process. My daughter helped me cook on it but she also got frustrated with the issues. Fast forward to now, it is early March. We are on our third induction top (my husband returned the first two because of the said issues). We also had to buy, ""try out"" and return a number of magnetic pots/pans. My family and I are very unhappy with the induction and just want a traditional electric stove. But my husband will not budge. My daughter, sister-in-law, and brother-in-law have all reached out to me separately offering to purchase an electric stove for our family. But everytime they speak to my husband, he shuts them down and nothing changes. Even though I have always cooked the meals for our family, I decided yesterday that I would not cook anymore if I have to use the induction. I've been so stressed out and depressed these past months because of this. My daughter and son support me, but I feel bad. Now I feel guilty because my husband doesn't know how to cook.AITA?"
8,,AITA for telling my(32M) dad(62M) off for habitually calling me while I’m trying to sleep?,660,m1ua0q,163,"I work night shifts, therefore I sleep during the day. I’ve been on this shift for over 10 years now, and it’s known to all my close friends and relatives to never call me during the day unless it’s an emergency.My grandmother passed away about 6 months ago. My dad was super close to her and he’s still pretty distraught by her passing. Outside of his job, she and I were the only people he even talked to. Understandably, he is very lonely and tries to talk to me whenever he can.I have virtually no problem with this. I make it a habit to call him every morning when I get off work just to check up on him. He is more than welcome to call me in the evenings to talk. That’s OK.However, in the last few months or so, he has started calling me around 12-1PM almost everyday, which wakes me up. If I wake up in the middle of my sleep, it’s nearly impossible for me to fall back asleep. He knows this, and he knows my sleep schedule as it has not changed in the last 10 years.Every time he calls me in this manner, he pretends like he didn’t know I was trying to sleep, which I know is a blatant lie. But I let it slide for a while because I know he’s still in mourning over his mother’s death.But, now it’s getting to the point where he calls me in the middle of the day consecutively on a daily basis. I am starting to lose sleep and I warned him in the past that if he starts causing me to lose sleep I am going to have to silence notifications from his phone. This only made him do it more.Yesterday, he called me at 10AM, 12PM, 2PM, and 3PM, none of which were for emergencies. After the fourth call, I lost my temper and said, “Fuck you.” and hung up on him. This triggered him to start blowing up my phone with text after text after text saying he had no idea I was trying to sleep despite me telling him otherwise. I called him back, not only to get him to stop blowing up my phone with texts, but to tell him to never call me in the middle of the day unless it’s a dire emergency. He said, “OK but don’t cuss me like that.”, to which I said, “No, if you can’t respect me enough to not wake me up repeatedly for no reason then I’m not going to respect you enough to not tell you to fuck off.” I hung up on him again. He then called me back and said “Can I get at least one minute of uninterrupted conversation with you?” I asked, “Is it an emergency?” He said, “No, but-“ I interrupted and said, “Then I’m going back to sleep. Have a nice fucking day!” I then silenced notifications from his phone. He has tried calling me and texting me almost nonstop since, but I can’t hear the notifications. I am still very angry, but I felt like I was being an asshole because he is still mourning.FYI I keep my ringer on while I sleep in case someone needs to reach me for emergencies.Am I the asshole here? I feel like I might be."
9,,WIBTA if I make my ex husband pay half the funeral expenses for our son when I had a life insurance policy for him?,392,m1wgcf,170,"To start off, my oldest son passed away unexpectedly 3 weeks ago. He was 20, it looks Iike an accidental overdose, still waiting in the toxicology report. No foul play is suspected but there is an investigation into who sold him what drugs. This is hell!  We are all devastated to say the least. I am taking it one day at a time and just trying to hold my other children up, get them through this school year without failing and help us all grieve in our own way. Seriously living my worst nightmare right now just keeping our heads above water emotionally. With my job that I obtained post divorce, I was offered life insurance policies on my children for a relatively small premium.  I took out a policy on each of them, never imagining I would use it. The funeral cost about $17,000 (the $25,000 policy covers it ) and at first I anticipated that I would just pay the whole amount out of the money. My ex immediately started wonder what would happen to the “extra” money (which after paying for a head stone, there would not be much of anything left over) and acting all around entitled about this insurance money paying the whole bill. I really wanted a little gratitude that I had thought ahead and appreciation that this was going to be covered without having to go into debt. Instead he was a jerk, acted entitled to this money and kept asking about the “leftover” money.  Thus I told him the policy is mine, I am the sole beneficiary and it will pay for my half, not his. He. Was. Pissed. He told me he was going to contact his attorney, thinking he had rights to this for some unknown reason and being a total dick to deal with. So far, I have stuck to my guns about him paying half but did concede if he paid his half of the funeral I would cover the headstone entirely, mostly so I don’t have to deal with him in the decision process. I am hearing conflicting reports when I tell friend/family this situation with the life insurance and I just want some outside verification that I am not the asshole in this situation, otherwise I will likely cave just to be done with it all and pay the full bill with the insurance money. May or may not be important: I have 4 kids, all with my ex husband of 18 years. We have been divorced for 5 years. We try to get along and succeed for the most part In efforts to co parent our kids. I blame him for the divorce and he blames me. He works for himself and has very little money saved up and he would probably have work a little bit scraping money together to come up with the cash. I went to school after the divorce (something he was against while we were still married and some of the reason for the divorce ) and now I have a good job with paid time off and benefits etc. I own a home (he does not) and would have to work less hard to come up with my half if I didn’t have this policy."
10,,AITA for telling my parents to back off and stop trying to get the cousins to meet?,689,m1tqgl,97,"So my sister (29f) and I (26f) have never had a good relationship. If you ask me why I could not tell you. All I know is we just never had what others would consider to be a good sibling relationship. I don't hate her but I know she has no interest in us having a relationship and she is adamant our kids will never know each other. I actually never met her kids, or got invited to her wedding, and she told our parents she won't show up to anything I'll be at. My parents attempted to convince her to let them facilitate a relationship between cousins and she said no. She told them never, actually.Now they are trying to go behind their back and asking me to let them have my son when they see my sisters kids. I told them no. That I would not go along with that for many reasons, including it being wrong even if they don't like what she's doing and on top of it all I'd face more backlash than them since it's me she has a problem with. And I told them I didn't want to risk her taking it out on my son.They're saying I should want the cousins to know each other at the very least. I told them it's not important to me and I don't want to fight about it but when they're older they can get to know each other when it's independent of us and when hopefully my sister won't flip out over it. They're saying I'm being just as selfish as her.AITA?"
11,,"AITA for refusing to take a ""longcut"" and driving my sister past a stinky farm?",1311,m1qbgf,333,"My sister (21F) had a wedding she had to attend out-of-state.  Since she didn't have a car at the time, I offered to drive her and 2 of her friends.I'd driven this way twice before. I remembered that I had learned that at one point, I could ignore my GPS's suggestion for taking a more roundabout route, and take a straight-shot on a long rural road.This road goes on for about 10 miles, almost no intersections or lights. The only things you pass are a state penitentiary, and 3 massive factory farms. ___________________When we got to this point on our drive, I noticed that this ""shortcut"" route had essentially no traffic on it, while there was moderate traffic if I avoided it. I wondered why no one really ever took this way.**Some important background: I personally have anosmia - almost no sense of smell.** I'm not really too sure what the sensation of ""smell"" is like for most people______________So, I start driving down this path, and my sister's friend suddenly said ""wait a minute, why are you taking this way?""I said ""what do you mean, it's the fastest way and there's no traffic,  why wouldn't I take this way.""All 3 were paying attention now, and saying to each other ""Isn't this that prison road...yeah, people don't go this way in the summer...""I was perplexed and asked what was wrong, and my sister said that the smell is horrific. She said that she could smell the farms even taking the ""roundabout"" route last time and it was unbearable from miles away, and was urging me more insistently now to turn around.Well, I told them there's no way it could be that bad. I wasn't going to turn around, drive 3 minutes back the way I'd just came, then drive another 25 minutes out of my way, to ""avoid a smell,"" especially when I'm paying for the gas!So I drove on, expecting to prove that they were overreacting. It seems that wasn't the case. We passed the prison, and then as we drove through the 1-mile stretch that made up the chicken farm or whatever it was, they were all violently retching, gagging, and crying.I tried to speed up, but it didn't seem to make it much better. My sister's friend opened the window and leaned out (I guess cause she thought she might throw up) as we were passing the hog farm, and I guess opening the window let more smell in, and both she and my sister ended up throwing up.__________________After we got out of that stretch of road, they were all very mad at me and we didn't talk much for the rest of the trip, after I pulled over at a gas station to let them clean up.AITA? Maybe I'm underestimating how smells affect people, but I've also never seen smells affect people like that and I wonder if their reactions are even typical or if they have an extreme aversion to that particular smell? Plus, with it being my car, should I be obligated to put more miles and gas into the car to just avoid an odor?"
12,,AITA for not caring if my dog wakes up the neighbor's children?,385,m1vr8v,148,"I live with my dog (Amy, 1.5yo Yorkie) in a 4 building complex. That's 4 buildings with around 13 floors each that create a square together and in the middle there is a shared garden and yard for everyone to enjoy (which counts as shared private property of the residents of the buildings)After I got Amy, I started taking her to the garden every evening at around 20:00 in the evening so that she can meet with other neighbor's dogs run, play, pee and poop (which I pick up obviously) and we always leave at around 20:45, never after 21:00. We formed up a small group of neighbors that usually go down with their dogs at this time so we can all meet each other.Lately, there's this 1 lady that constantly starting to scream out of the window that this is not a dog park, that the dogs are waking up her kids and that we should not bring the dogs there at all because this place is for kids and not for dogs. Our dogs don't bark a lot but sometimes they do let out a few barks when they get excited over something.The first few times I just took Amy back after the lady screamed through the window (and she was screaming like a banshee every time) But then a few evening ago the usual screaming started again but the dogs didn't even bark at all so I got a little angry and yelled back at the lady that I don't care about her kids and that we're allowed to be there at this hour and if she doesn't like it she can shut the window (which has brilliant sound insulation) or move.I'm not sure if I'm in the right here because I know raising children is hard especially if they're young and don't sleep well but this park is pretty much my only option to let her out for a little while and should accommodate for all the residents of the complex not just people with human kids but also people with dog kids... so AITA?**Clarification, the yard between the buildings is BIG and is mostly grass, roads and only a small section of it is children playground. Its more like a park than a garden.**Amy and Luli (friend)[]( There is no rule or law against dogs in the complex park or the complex itself.  Edit2: I uploaded a video of them playing for those of you who think i'm downplaying the amount of noise the dogs generate  []("
13,,AITA for telling my mom that my father didn't do anything for her birthday?,710,m1sqg8,34,"My mother and I can have a rocky relationship at times but I love her more than anyone on this planet. And it was her birthday a few days back. I'm a school student and I don't get pocket money, I don't have a job and my parents buy me whatever I need so I've never asked to be given any allowance.For my mom's birthday, I asked my father repeatedly to buy a cute gift, I gave him multiple options regarding what she would like. But the day before her birthday, he said he hasn't had any time, which is a big fat lie because I know he had a lot. The cake for her birthday? I spent 2 weeks asking him to book one so we would be prepared, instead, he went and bought it 2 hours before her birthday. It was a very small celebration, just the three of us, but my mom was happy. My dad told her he will buy her a gift soon and that he has had a busy week, again it's a lie.It's been 2 weeks since then, and my dad's sister is visiting. She didn't even bother wishing my mom on her birthday, and my dad asked my mom to select a gift for his sister as she is leaving. My mom asked him if he had forgotten about her, if he didn't value her and why should she buy gifts for a woman who talks trash behind her back when her own husband didn't buy her a birthday gift.A few hours later, my mom was crying, and I told her that he didn't buy anything despite me pestering him for weeks and the cake came because I demanded it. My dad even yelled at me for ""bothering"" him about it. She was more sad, but told me that as I don't even earn money yet and I am young, I shouldn't be worried about it. My dad found out I told her and called me a liar and later told me I made things worse and I've been a bad daughter.I feel guilty because I feel like I made things worseAITA?"
14,,AITA for refusing to babysit my father's kids?,160,m202sz,54,"I (20f) live with two roommates and currently am not working or in school because where I work has not resumed yet since Covid. We are getting paid though. I do have income coming in from my employer so rent is no big deal. My father (who I'm estranged from) reached out via social media and also via other family to ask me to babysit my half siblings since he and his wife are back at work now.My father and I are estranged because after my mom died when I was 7 he gave me 5 ""new mom's"" in quick succession before the sixth one actually married him when I was 10. Every single woman he dated he introduced to me and told me they would be my new mom. He spent those three years dating non stop and looking for someone else to take my mom's place. He found someone more than willing. But it left me feeling pretty damn abandoned and angry that he thought he could just replace her for me. Then he didn't like how I was not going to call her mom or go along with what he wanted which he told me was selfish and bratty and how I was out to ruin everything for them. They had two kids together while I still lived there and might have more, I'm not sure. I went to my grandparents for a few months before I turned 18 and then I moved in with friends. I have not spoken to him or seen him in three years. No contact at all.Until he reached out. I told him no. I told him not to ask again.My grandparents told me they understand why I don't want to help him but I should see it as a chance to get to know the kids. And that I should want that because regardless we are related through blood. I honestly have no interest but maybe that makes me a jerk.AITA?"
15,,AITA for getting someone into debt?,940,m1qm10,249,"More like are we the assholes, tbh im super confussed.I (f15) have 3 friends, Joy, Rosie and Hani all 15 too (well, Hani will be 15 this saturday) we all bonded over not having great parents. Not a great thing to bond over but well, i think its important to mention that.A few days ago Hani got sick with a stomach flu so we all started to check on her through our group chat and two days ago Hani texted us telling us she was in lots of pain. Her parents weren't at home, they never do anything anyway.Both Joy and Rosie happened to be close to her home so they went to see her and from what i know, she wasn't okay.Now, Rosie is extremely emetophobic and i wouldn't trust Joy with a pet rock but they handled it well. Then i came over too and brought some things (we all have been taking care, i promise) Hani wasn't getting better at all and we were watching a movie when she started crying, she was literally sobbing and her breathing was fast.We didn't know what to do and none of us can drive so Joy called an ambulance. Turns out her appendix exploded or something like that.The hospital obviously called her parents who are now upset because we got them into debt. They are extremely wealthy so money has never been an issue at all for them but they are upset.Our parents are too, Joy even got punished and doesn't have her phone right now and we all feel super bad but we didn't know what to do at the moment.Are we the assholes?ETA: When i say wealthy i mean that they're like a fresh prince kinda family with the moneyI think i might be the asshole by calling the ambulance without really having a permission to do so, which caused problems for everyone around me"
16,,AITA for not supporting my daughter in something insignificant about her future career?,317,m1vd8k,92,"My daughter loves working around children/animals, she’s not a people person and isn’t social towards adults.She comes out of her shell when it’s sort of a transaction? So she can talk normally unless it’s a casual conversation.She’s in her first year of college in early years and she was adamant on doing something with children social work or children’s play therapist.The college did a careers thing where they answer questions and you get recommended careers and my daughter did not get recommended either of the jobs she was adamant on doingShe got recommendedProbation officer Clinical psychologist She started venting to me about how she’s not suited in tough jobs like that, could I imagine her as a probation officer or clinical psychologist? The answer is no but then she said money was important to her in a job and **shockingly enough** there is no money to be made in childcare.I told her to ignore it because it doesn’t really mean much and she’s looked after children for years and is great at it but now she’s certain she’s not suited for childcare anymore because they weren’t the recommended jobs.At the end of the day it’s an insignificant quiz and I’m not going to coddle her over it.She can be a probation officer, I’d rather she didn’t because to my knowledge it’s dangerous but at the end of the day if she chooses to take the quiz to heart then it’s her choice.My wife is mad that I’m not being more supportive but I just can’t find myself to support this drama. It’s a quiz? What’s the big deal. She’s never going to do a job like probation officer or psychologist because she’s not suited so I don’t actually have to take this seriously.AITA?"
17,,AITA for reading my stepdaughter's diary?,142,m20f3e,238,"My stepdaughter is 15 and found out about a year ago that an older male attempted to groom her as a kid. She has been seeing a therapist on and off for the last year, has been keeping a diary, and is doing great.She is away at camp right now, so I was tidying up her room and found her diary. I opened it to make sure it wasn't an empty notebook and I saw words which would indicate that type of specific thing midway on a page and decided to just start from the beginning and read it to ensure it wasn't a new situation we needed to be aware of. It wasnt very long but found out some personal things like she had tried her first sip of alcohol with a friend about a year ago, played a kissing game at camp with boys AND girls, and that she is still internally dealing with what happened when she was younger. I told my husband what I found expecting him to be upset like I was and to want to give her a talk, but he didn't want to know any more of what I found, said that what I've learned wasn't a big deal and instead was mad at me for going through her diary but says he wouldn't be as mad if I had read that one sentence alone to know that it wasn't something new or serious and closed it, but I disagree. This is important information about my stepdaughter I wouldn't have ever known if I hadn't read it.My husband thinks I'm TA and is upset because I'm not apologetic about reading something I have every right to read if I'm concerned enough as a parent.I feel like her past situation, her seeming a bit down lately (not getting out or going down to the beach with her friends much anymore and sad/crying about how it feels like they're not really even friends anymore), and of course me accidentally seeing that word are enough to warrant reading the rest of it and honestly I don't feel like its wrong for a parent to read their kids diary **if they feel like they need to** anyway. **Where I think I'm NTA.** He is planning to tell her and says I should be ""apologetic"" to her because he thinks it will upset her that I've read these private entries. I think he is going to unnecessarily hurt my relationship with her and she probably won't trust me afterward when there's no reason for him to say anything at all. I feel like I didn't do anything that any other concerned parent wouldn't do in my situation. If he tells her, I'm going to go ahead and confront her about the things I read in it because I feel like its our duty as parents. Her father says we shouldn't even know them, that they're mild and were so long ago (about a year) but I feel like he's TA for not wanting to support me and instead wanting to throw me under the bus by telling her that Ive read it.Even worse he has taken the diary, doesn't want to hear any more about what I found and instead is planning to tell her and give it to her when she comes back from camp and have her hide it from now on and is not going to support me in confronting her.Am I the asshole?"
18,,AITA for wanting a prenup?,116,m21987,106,"I was married for 9 years. We have two children, 7M and 6F. Three years ago, after a sudden illness, she passed away. It was the most devastating thing to every happen to me. The only reason I made it through is because of my kids and needing to be strong for them.  I used my wife's life insurance to pay off the mortgage. It's in a beautiful area, excellent schools, and very low taxes. If anything happens to me, I have things set up so that my wife's sister will be our children's guardian and they can remain in the house. I carry enough life insurance that they won't ever lose the home.  Shortly after my wife passed, an old girlfriend reached out to offer condolences. She has 3 kids, one is in her twenties, one is a teenager, and one is 3. She was incredibly supportive, cooked meals, helped out with the kids, and was amazing to my family.  About a year ago, we both admitted we still had those feelings and started dating again. It's been strange to be with someone again. I don't want to say it's easier, but at the same time I feel like it would have been much harder to try to meet someone. I don't know if I ever would have gone looking. I still love my wife and my kids are number one in my heart.  A few weeks ago she brought up marriage. I said I wasn't there yet, and she understood. When I thought about it, I sat down with her and explained that everything is set up to provide for my children in the event something happens to me. I told her that I wasn't there yet, but that if we were to get married, I would want a prenup.  I told her what I have in place, informed her that the house would go to my children, my life insurance would remain in their names, and any assets I already own would be exempt in the event of divorce. As she would need to sell her home, I told her that we would write it into the agreement that the money from the sale of her home was hers.  She was very hurt and told me that if anything happened to me, she wanted to be the one to raise my children and give them a good life. She told me that she wanted us to have the family that we never got to have because we broke up. I replied that if we got married, I was willing to revisit guardianship, but I can't see budging on assets, at least until they got through college, because I could never forgive myself if their future was in jeopardy.  We broke up because she cheated and while she's told me it was the biggest mistake of her life and showed me she's changed, it's still in the back of my mind.  I offered to take out additional life insurance, naming her the beneficiary. She says it's about forging a partnership, and she doesn't want to feel like a removable guest in a marriage. She is opposed to any prenuptial agreement.  Some friends have told me I'm only protecting my children, others have pointed out that she's been there for me for almost 3 years in whatever way I've needed and I'm hurting her by putting conditions on everything.  Edit: Clarifying that she cheated over ten years ago when we were originally together. I met my wife right after and we've remained friendly after I forgave her."
19,,AITA for kicking my niece out because of her necklace,154,m1xtcm,92,"I am a catholic christian, my niece\[20f\] is atheist and I have no problem with that. I don't force my religion on others the most I will do about that is spread gospel with my christian family/friends. My sister and her boyfriend broke up so she asked if her and niece can stay at my place. I said ok and they are sharing the guest room. I made sure to remove religious items from that room so it won't seem like I am shoving my religion down her throat. My niece has kind of a goth style (don't know how else to describe it) and I am fine with that. I only asked her to change once when she had a shirt with jesus on it and some offensive things were painted on him (horns, etc.) she changed and rolled her eyes but that was it. One day she was in the kitchen and I noticed her necklace that was a rosary. I asked her where she got it and she said she found it in the house and it was cute. I told her that it is very sacred and that it makes me uncomfortable that she had it on and is using it as a necklace. She said that I can't force her to be my religion onto her and that I am judging her. I told her yes I am and that it is my house so if i am upset about what you are wearing then you should change. She called me a b\*tch then she stuck the finger up then I asked her to leave, she got her things and then ripped up the necklace and asked if I was happy. My sister got home and then said that I was wrong for asking her to change since it is her body and that she is with her ex now. My parents also yelled at me for doing that. AITA for asking her to change?"

They are husband and wife and have a son that also works at the restaurant. Anyways, we are not allowed to bring coffee in the store and the menu doesn’t serve anything caffeinated, we could get fired if we do so. They don’t even serve pepsi or coke just the decaf versions.So the husband and wife went on a vacation for a week and the son was running the store. My co-workers and I wanted coffee so bad so I made an order for 4 iced espressos for all of us. we were drinking quickly before the son came but unfortunately he caught as and he’s threatening to get us all fired. This guy happens to vape but doesn’t see the hypocrisy in that. Now one of my co-workers threatened to sue the restaurant because it’s discriminatory. Was it my fault for bringing in the drinks or are the owners discriminatory and I didn’t do anything wrong ?"
21,,AITA for not wanting my mom to sleep in my room with me and indirectly telling her to leave?,86,m1zon8,82,"I know this sounds extremely crazy but I just need some verification. For starters I’ll say that I do love my mom, but sometimes I think she forgets how old I am. I am 13 turning 14. She calls me baby-ish names that are like pookie or stuff like that sometimes in public. Both my parents always ask me to sleep in their room but I say maybe later because I wouldn’t want them to be sad if I said no. I feel super embarrassed writing this but I just need some validation. The story goes like this- it was a regular night for me and I was literally browsing r/AmITheAsshole before I was planning on sleeping. But then my mom strolls into my room and sleeps in the bed saying “ I want to sleep in my sons room today”. I really didn’t know what to say and I dreaded this because she has done this numerous times, but I decided enough was enough and I wanted to let her know I just wanted to sleep by myself. I told her that I wanted to sleep in my room by myself and she kept asking why. I gave her the honest reason- I wanted to sleep by myself. She kept pressing me for an answer and I kept telling her that I wanted to sleep by myself. She said that she would sleep here tonight with me. Then she assumed I wanted her to leave because I was going to browse on my phone . She asked “ what were you doing on your phone I want to know?”. I knew that I didn’t have to tell her and I stated that. She didn’t take it kindly and got mad at me saying her and my dad paid for my phone so she has a right to know.I was getting annoyed and uncomfortable, and I stepped out of the room for a moment to catch a breath. When I return she is crying and I know where this is headed. Her face is red and tears are streaming down , then she angrily exits telling me to not talk to her and leave her alone since I don’t want her here. The next day I wake up to the laptop I use for school gone (It's hers but she lets me use it). (She was not trying to manipulate me, she just wanted to make me use the other worse devices because she knows I love using her laptop) I was in a phone call with her now and she implied that was trying to punish me by doing that. I calmly stated that I don't mind using our old desktop and she said ""good"". Then she was berating me for treating her harshly and I felt very bad. She said , don't talk to me , you're too big for your mom right? I stated that it was untrue and I tried to move on from the subject. Then I realized this was perfect for an AITA? story. I told her to have a nice day because I didn't know what to say or how to feel. So AITA? Please don't trash-talk her much, I love her a lot and I'd just prefer an explanation on who's wrong and why. Thank you for respecting that!Edit: Missed details that could totally change how you look at this! Super sorry!"
22,,AITA for withholding my baby from my mom,74,m21407,42,"I'll admit, that title makes me sound like a monster. My husband and I have a 15 month old son. We never planned on having more kids, as we already have two boys, both currently in high school. My only sibling also has two kids, who are also both in high school. So a new baby was a big deal to everyone. I live thirty minutes away from my mother, and although our relationship isn't a great one, I figured I'd be seeing her a lot. Well, the baby arrived with quite a traumatic entry, so we restricted hospital visits so I could recover and not play host. My mom was unhappy with that as i didn't let her new husband in to see the baby at the hospital. Honestly, zero desire for someone I didn't know very well to see me in an adult diaper and a sports bra and nothing else. So right after, she kind of avoided us because she had hurt feelings. Then she was sick for a few weeks and couldn't see him. Then the pandemic started. All and all, she didn't see him from when he was a couple months old until he was seven or eight months old. After that, when she did see him its because I've gone to her house. I honestly got tired of trying to push the relationship, so I quit taking him out there often. Any time she brings up how long its been since she saw him I remind her that she's more than welcome to come out to our house any time she wants. My husband and I both work full time, she only works part time (she's retired) so I feel like her driving out isn't asking too much. The last time she came out to visit him was for his first birthday. Since then I've taken him to her house once. Now she's guilting me about how he doesn't know who she is, and she's upset that she never sees him. Should I be making more of an effort again? AITA for not taking making sure he sees his grandparent often?"
23,,AITA for not supporting my girlfriend's plan to cheat her way through college?,1131,m1lipv,234,"This is a condensed account of an issue I previously posted on Relationship Advice.My girlfriend has fairly severe ADHD for which she is currently prescribed Adderall, and she has previously stayed in a mental hospital for her anxiety and eating disorder. Even with her medication, these conditions make it difficult for her to engage with her studies.That being said, her struggles with school are not solely concentric with her mental health struggles. She seems to have a skewed perspective of the amount of work college demands of a student. To her, two hours of reading is ""a lot of work,"" when in reality three to fours hours a day is the bare minimum for most college students. She has a similarly skewed perspective on research and intellectual pursuits in general reading two or three articles rarely imparts even a rough understanding of an issue like the intrinsic racism and misogyny of sororities, despite what she might think.Late last week, my girlfriend was facing a big load of pressing work: a looming midnight deadline for a paper, finishing up an already-late assignment, and preparing a presentation for noon the next day. It quickly became clear none of this work could be done in the proper time frame, and she turned to me for help. She asked if I could ""edit"" her paper, which was soon clearly code for 'do it for her.' I told her there's no way I could write it in time - after all, I have no knowledge on the topic and haven't read any of her assigned articles - but I could certainly be happy to brainstorm with her and proofread her paper before she turns it in. She questioned why I wouldn't at least try to do it for her, to which I said I don't feel comfortable outright cheating and don't think that does anyone any good.As you could guess by the title, she got upset and became very hostile. She began to craft her argument supporting cheating. Here are some of the things she said:""I know all the information, but sometimes my ADHD means I can't just sit down and get it all on paper.""""It's not fair that some people just know how to write well."" (Of course, she took offense when I implied these assignments force her to work on her writing, which is part of what college is designed to teach.)""I'm at a disadvantage because of my condition and the disability office doesn't give me enough accommodations. If I'm not given accommodations to make up for the extra difficulties I face, I need to find ways to even out those difficulties myself. Sometimes this means someone needs to do my papers for me.""""All college is about is getting a degree to function in the world, so it really doesn't matter whether I do my own work or not.""Before long, she said, ""Fuck you,"" and told me to ""stop being mean to [her]"". She said I'm ""ableist"" and ""not as good a person as [she] thought"" for not recognizing her 'need' to cheat and for suggesting that she simply might have to work harder than the average student due to her conditions.Am I the asshole?"

I on the other hand am 5.6 (about 62kg) and always get picked on for being so short (my family is very tall), I'm not bad looking but I do not look anywhere near as good as Maria and I have have really bad body image problems mostly fueled by my family, my parents in particular. When I was 12 I heard my parents talking about how they thought I would be the 'ugly duckling' and how I had too much weight on me (I have never been close to being overweight) and how I would not very good looking and that has stuck with me fueling my own self confidence and body image problems. It is also fueled on by my parents still. Because Maria does not not believe that she is stunning my parents are constantly giving her pep talks saying things like ""You are so much skinnier than OP, you could even be a model if you wanted!"", ""You have such an amazing figure! OP wishes she looked as good as you!"", ""Your face is so clear and unblemished unlike OP's"" (I struggle with acne every now and then) and ""if you wanted a boyfriend you could get one as soon as you wanted, OP's never had a boyfriend because she doesn't look as good as you"". And while I know that Maria is absolutely gorgeous the constant criticism of me to bring her up really gets to me and is just making me feel worse and worse so WIBTA if I try to sit down with my mum, she is the main one doing it all, and talk to her about how it makes me feel and try to get her to stop when I know that they are doing it to try to help my sister?"
26,,AITA for pissing off my HOA? They don't allow home renovations during the weekend,57,m21qdp,78,"My HOA a few weeks ago decided that they will not be allowing home renovations during the weekends, they never gave a sensible reason other than people want to enjoy the weekends without noise or something. Kind of ridiculous if you ask me.Well last Thursday a tree fell onto my shed, crushing it and also destroying my gutters. I don't have time on weekdays, it was going to take me and my wife quite a while to fix it. She can't do it alone, so we waited until Saturday morning. We were both too busy with work, and I was out of town until saturday morning so we did it then. To me this didn't even seem as a renovation, these are emergency repairs.Well we spend about 6 hours and we fix the shed, gutters, replace some shingles, and have someone remove the tree and take the wood away. Well, the HOA is not happy.They sent me a letter saying I need to pay a fine for violating the CCR. I am 100% sure that's illegal, and they can't do this. I ignored it. They then came and visited me, and explained to me I'd need to pay a few hundred dollar fine, that this was a violation of the CCR and bla bla bla.  I told them ""what I did was not wrong, I had a serious problem, I had to fix it and was only available on the weekend, now leave me alone and do not ever talk to me ever again about this"" and I shut the door.He comes back with more HOA members and they basically say the same shit again and I am getting more and more agitated and I said ""as I told you before, I did nothing wrong so KINDLY FUCK OFF ASSHOLE"" and slammed the door. I have been getting more letters saying they wont condone or tolerate my ""aggressive"" behavior. Fucking ridiculous.  EDIT: I forgot to mention, this isn't the first time this happened. It happened in Texas a while back ""No weekend home improvementsThe Houston Chronicle shared the story of  one of its readers who has an HOA that doesn’t allow homeowners to carry  out home improvement tasks on Saturday or Sunday. Isn’t that what  weekends are made for? If you live in such an association and want to  install gutters or replace your front door, you’ll have to schedule a  day off from work to get it done.""   "

I was confused. she explained that while the tradition was firstborn, for the past 5 generations the firstborns have been girls and she thinks that the ring should go to my niece.I told her no. the ring belonged to my son. he was my wife's firstborn and my wife had given it to him. it was important to him. she did not like this, many people have called me to ask about what is going on. some are angry at me, some are angry at MIL. it's their family heirloom, not mine so many I should give it back?

28,,WIBTA for giving my daughter the same name as my brother's previous dog,139,m1ufc9,74,"My (26F) husband and I had always wanted to use a certain name if we were going to have a daughter, let's say the name was ""Mia"". We have a hard long surname to match and a lot of criteria to fit, and this was one option that fit perfectly and we both loved. However just by coincidence, when I was pregnant the first time my brother and his wife got a rescue dog and named it Mia. When my daughter was born, we thought it would be too weird to give her the same name as my brother's dog, because we see them quite regularly and assumed the dog would be a big part of our lives. We gave our daughter a different name. Since then I have often felt mild regret that we didn't go with Mia because it is still our favourite name and it would have suited her perfectly, but we are happy enough with the name we chose.Over the 3 years that my brother had the dog, there were a whole lot of issues with her. The dog was really aggressive and destructive, and my brother and his wife didn't have enough time or energy to train her properly. They frequently would go away for a few days and leave the dog alone, with a dog walker coming once a day, and she would bark and whine and destroy things and neighbours would constantly complain. My brother's wife always disliked the dog and wanted to re-home it with a family that could put in more effort training her and didn't travel so often, but my bother was completely obsessed- she was like his best buddy, and he refused to give her away. Finally, after a scary incident involving a neighbour's child (she didn't attack the child, but came very close) my family staged an intervention of sorts, where they organised for the dog to be re-homed despite my brother refusing. He was and still is absolutely furious and devastated. Anyway, I'm now pregnant again and we just found out it's a girl. This time we really really want to use the name Mia, because the dog is no longer in our lives and won't have been for over a year . I know that there are negative associations with the name, but our daughter will have her name for her entire life and this dog will soon be a distant memory. We will never see the dog again, and nobody else in the family really talks about it now. But just out of curiosity, I broached the idea to my other sister and explained the situation, and she thought we would be crazy and kinda mean for using that name and that it would bring up old wounds in the family that everyone is trying to move on from. I said that everyone will forget about the dog Mia and that within a few months everyone will just think of my daughter when they hear the name Mia and not the dog. I know that if I ask my brother about it he'll get upset, and I don't think I should have to ask his permission to use a name that we love. But would it cause more trouble than it's worth? WIBTA if I named my second daughter Mia?"
29,,AITA for un-invite a 12yrs old from my bachelor party?,64,m1y8er,42,"Where I'm from, its traditional to have a combined bachelor party. Think about a huge day long party with all your friends, not just a few. So you are able to celebrate with anyone even if you dont invite them to the actual wedding & for most people it's like the last big party before children.It was organised by our best men with more 200 guests .We didnt knew exact plans but had a few hinchs about how it would be. My close friend is a single mom to ""M"" 12f. She was invited and so knew about the plans more than I did in advance. I met her a week before the party & she casually said that M is looking forward to the party and is really excited about it. I just froze and asked her what she meant. She told me that she would bring her along to the party. So even that I didnt knew the exact details I knew for SURE that it would be in NO WAY child friendly. There would be tons of alcohol, strippers & people possibly do drugs (like it's a party). After I told her this she was shocked and pissed. Now her daughter would be upset (I never mentioned that she can bring her along, nor did anyone else mention children) & she is not sure if she will attend herself if her daughter is not. I apologised for upsetting M, but stand firm that even if I didnt knew exactly what will going on that it will not be for kids & that I never thought about that anyone would assume that it would be a family-event. Then she rant about that there will be people doing drugs (she is against any kind) & is pissed about how she never thought I would be friends with drug users. Even if I'm not doing drugs anymore, I tried different things when I was younger and dont judge other people for using party drugs. Hell maybe I will smoke some weed myself on my bachelor party who knows? And I'm sorry but I cant dictate and control 200 people, some I never even met before one day long not using any kind of drugs at a party.The mood was tense & I left shortly after. 3 days before the party she wrote me a novel how she cannot attend and that she is reconsidering our friendship because she will not have people in her life who are okay with drug using. I tried in my eyes the best to ensure to her that it's not this big deal & that she is really important to me and that it would be a shame to end our friendship because of this, but she wouldn't have any of it and said it would be best if we go different ways in the future. Never heard from her since & blocked me an social media .Mutual friends say I should have clarified the party better with her & should have tried more to accommodate her or just let her bring M along. Also I should have not lied to her about my view about drugs."
30,,AITA for telling my mum I want to have my own apartment or live in dorms for uni?,62,m1y1zl,26,"My mum comes from a background and a culture where children stay with their parents almost till their 30's or at least until they get married. My mum is used to not being alone, and she loves having people around. I enjoy it too, but I love spending time alone, either just cause or because I want to be alone to process thoughts, cry, go online, play games. We live alone in a one-bedroom house (were not the best we've been financially), so we sleep together, which I don't mind, and we've been his way for a couple of years now. Because I don't have my own room, I tend to leave the room she's in to be alone sometimes. I need to mention here that my mum has sacrificed almost everything for me and my education and a better future for me, and I am very grateful and also that her parents died while she was still a child.This morning, we were discussing my university applications and my options, and we were talking about the case I get accepted away from where we live. She said that we'd have to leave the house and move there. At that point, I said that I would like to have a dorm room. She started fake-crying (as a joke, I'm assuming) and saying that I didn't love her and that I wanted to leave her behind. I didn't comment on it cause I know she knows that's not true. I just got up, left the room, went to the living room started doing assignments. About 10 minutes later, she comes in, and I say, ""good morning, I've made tea"", to which she doesn't reply, and I repeat it. I get up and ask her what's up, and she says I left her there while crying and how heartless I could be. I tell that she was not crying, and I knew it, but I did apologise for leaving her alone when she was sad. Then as if that was never the issue, she starts yelling at me about how could I want to be alone and how I just want her dead (no clue where that came from) and how other kids would pray that they could be near their parents till they're old, but I am just going to throw her to the bin as soon as I'm out. That I do not appreciate all she has done for me and not rush to be alone so much, I'll eventually get my wish (in a very weird tone as if she's mocking me).  I mention it here and there (wanting to live alone for uni) when talking about uni, but I don't press on it because I know of our situation. I like the idea of being independent, and honestly, living in dorms is by itself an experience, good or bad, and I don't want to miss it. Dad (who lives in another country atm) says that my mum is trying hard to get us all back together and that me trying to separate us again seems selfish and shows how ungrateful I am.   So Am I The Asshole?"
31,,AITA for not telling my flatmate their food was done?,65,m1xe7t,56,"Throwaway for obvious reasons and keeping details at a minimal. My flatmate was cooking food while I was cooking, and I had a few different things to cook so I was focusing on my food. My flatmate went off to do something and set a timer, which goes off at a high pitch that you’re able to hear it over a lot of noise. They come back 5 mins later and get angry at me for not telling them their food was done and their food had been sitting there (the timer had turned off the stove automatically) and was now overcooked and inedible. So AITA for not telling him his food was done?Edit: the stove shuts off automatically once the timer goes off so the food was just sitting in the hot water, that’s how it got overcooked. The stove was off already so it was no cause for concern for any hazards etc."
32,,AITA for tricking my mom into thinking I quit my job?,27,m241k6,20,"I’ve always wanted to write books for a living. The older I got, however, the more I realized it couldn’t be a full time job, not until I got a few books published anyway. So, while I majored in English and have always kept writing, I got a full time job teaching. I love what I do and try to find time to write when I can.My parents are incredibly supportive but think getting published is easy. They think that I can just write in a Starbucks and become JK Rowling over night. I’ve explained that success on your first book like that is rare and there’s a reason why people like her make the news. They say I should just try harder, as if it’s that easy. I’ve tried to explain myself and ask them to please back off, but they persist. It can be annoying and digs at my creative process.At brunch last week, they started again, telling me it’s been 2 years since I graduated. Where’s my bestselling book? I tried to explain it to them again (I’m working on it, but even when I start the publishing process, it’s going to take awhile and I’ll probably still have to teach). They wouldn’t listen.Here’s where I might be the asshole. On Tuesdays, I get done early. I decided to call my mom and say “Hey, get my old room ready. I quit my job and I’m coming home.” She was confused and I said “Well, this way I can focus 100% on writing my best selling novel. I can’t pay rent without my job though, so I’ll have to give up my apartment. Probably my car.” She started freaking out, saying she never told me to do that. She was begging me to go get my job back. I let her squirm for an hour and called her back, saying it wasn’t real. I asked how it felt to be hit with the reality of what would happen if I only focused on writing right now. She called me a bitch and said that I had no right to scare her like that. I did apologize but both of them say it was too far. AITA?"
33,,WIBTA if I cut him off?,35,m21jn7,57,"So today I called my dad about yet another overdue bill.Long story short my dad has horrible credit from poor decisions on his part in his 20-30’s so being the wonderful daughter I am and seeing as I have great credit , I offered to get him a new phone under my plan on the condition that he pays his bill every month.The first three months he paid nothing so I got stiffed and was stuck paying the bill in full. You would think that this would be a red flag for what was to come but me being the naïve doormat that I am I expected him to start keeping up with his part of the bill.Of course that hasn’t always happened and this has been an ongoing issue, to the point where I had to take a Centrelink loan to pay the overdue balance owing to try and get in front of it.It’s gotten to the point where the current bill is almost $250 due to three unpaid bills in a row on his end and accumulating late fees. Plus owing me over $700 for covering his ass when bills were going unpaid. Again, I’m an idiot.He has decided to tell me he now has plans to upgrade his handset now that his old contract is up, like he thinks I’m willing to continue letting him dodge the bills. WIBTA if I went down to my telco tomorrow morning and disabled his post-paid account and basically told him to GTFO and stick with prepaid?"
34,,"AITA for not asking ""how high"" when my pregnant wife said ""jump""?",516,m1lzip,142,"A little background.My wife, 3yr old daughter, and I have been living with my parents since November. the house we bought won't be ready until August and we sold our house in the fall to take advantage of the soaring real estate prices of houses in the fall. Financially it was a good idea. Mental health-wise...My parents' house consists of my 60+ parents and 20-something bro. So, we're five adults and a toddler under one roof in the middle of a pandemic. My mom does 80% of the cooking. Her choice and desire. She'd do 100% if it wasn't for some serious neck, shoulder, and back pain she's developed. We cook on the weekends to give her a break.She cooks during the week and I make it a priority to wash up every evening. My wife tries to help but she's now almost 5 months pregnant.Tonight, she developed a severe itch on her feet. It's apparently a thing. She was very uncomfortable all evening. The family offered a variety of methods to help soothe but nothing worked. I was in the middle of washing dishes and asked if she wanted me to get calamine lotion. She said yes.I was going to finish doing the washing and then head out. I was about five minutes away from finishing when my now annoyed wife asked why I wasn't going. I said I was just finishing and would head out. The argument went back and forth. She said she'd just go. I said I'm leaving in five. She said the dishes weren't going anywhere.Annoyed, I left the washing and went to get it. I then came back, finished the washing, and put our daughter to bed and here I am.From my perspective, my wife has no patience. Pre-pregnancy this was an issue and now the pregnancy has exasperated it. I do come from a ""tough it out"" mentality, but know she doesn't and try to be accomodating when I can. But sometimes (like now) I find her very inconsiderate and selfish.I know this is a relatively tame story for her, but I want to know: Am I the Asshole?  UPDATE: Well, that's way more activity than I anticipated. Thanks for the opinions. Both good and bad. Don't seem to have some sort of consistency, which is always interesting to see. As to all the concerns about cholestasis: we know. This isn't our first rodeo and dealt with a myriad of complications during pregnancy and after birth, including severe itchiness the last time So, our stance is generally to remain collected but cautious with any concerns. My wife spoke to her OB first thing this morning and was told that because she is only 20 weeks, it isn't a point of emergency. She has a scheduled appointment in 5 days. My wife was told if she wants attention sooner than that she would have to go to the emergency. My wife is very against going to the emergency especially in this day and age. So, she's going to try and get a blood test done so that the OB can assess it on Monday. Also, since this is my post, I'm going to give a probably unpopular opinion. While I sincerely do appreciate the concern about her health from a bunch of complete strangers (seriously, no sarcasm here: it's very sweet to see people look out for each other like that), there are a lot of health care professionals in my family and friend circle, including my own wife. Self-diagnosing through Reddit and Google is super dangerous and the level of stress that can be associated with it is not healthy. Itchy hands and feet can be a sign of cholestasis. But it can also just be a sign of pregnancy. Cholestasis is actually pretty uncommon and is easily treatable. That doesn't mean we ignore it but it doesn't mean anyone has to panic, either.  The language we use to discuss things can be super important. And mass panic and talks of stillbirths can do more damage than good. Again, just my opinion. But also my post :)"
35,,WIBTA if I refuse to go on a family trip if we don’t stay at a hotel the whole time.,62,m1wliy,38,"Once Summer hits and if everything with Covid gets better, my mother plans to take a trip back to her home country to visit my grandparents/uncles/cousins. Iv told her that I won’t go with her unless we stay at a hotel while we are there because I didn’t like how crowded the house was and it made me quite uncomfortable. The last time I stayed at my grandparents house was hard on me because I didn’t get much privacy. ( only got it when I showered or went to the toilet and even then people almost walked in many times ) I had to share a bed for a month which was unpleasant. I just really value my space and I didn’t get any the last time I went so I don’t think I could do it again. So would I be the asshole?"
36,,WIBTA if I changed who my maid of honour is after already asking someone?,75,m1v3ua,31,"My wedding is in 6 months. I'm having 3 bridesmaids, my sister, my long-time best friend Riley, and a newer best friend Amy. I asked Amy to be my maid of honour and she happily accepted. I met her through my finance as she is his best friends partner. We all spend a lot of time together as a group but her and I also speak a lot and spent time together just the two of us. We are close but Amy and I have had some big arguments that we've seemingly moved on from.A few months ago Amy called me concerned, saying that she thought that Riley should be my maid of honour as she'd known me for longer and been friends with me since the beginning of high school. I told her that while that is true, her and I were also just as close and Riley and I lived in different cities now so weren't as close as we once were. I also told her that I'd have asked Riley if I wanted her, but I didn't I'd asked her. Amy told me that she was just making sure and it was just her anxiety.Recently Amy and I seem to have drifted. She has a few other friends and seems to be spending a lot of time with them, which is fine, but the only time her and I have spent together lately is when the group all hang out together. We still message each other but it's not as much as before. She also recently got engaged and is planning her wedding. She has asked some other friends to be bridesmaids and not me. I'm fine with that it just got me thinking that maybe we aren't as close  as I thought we were? Also Riley and I have been speaking a lot and she's been really supportive of me, asking if I need any help with planning and checking in. Also I was able to visit her recently and we just picked up where we left off, no damage to the relationship at all.It's all got me thinking that maybe Amy was hinting at something and trying to say we weren't that close, and I'm starting to agree that Riley should be my maid of honour. I don't want to hurt Amy's feelings though if I'm wrong and it really was her anxiety.Reddit, wibta if I told Amy I no longer wanted her as maid of honour, just a bridesmaid, and asked Riley to be maid of honour instead?Edit: TLDR Asked new friend to be MOH. We've seemingly drifted and she's potentially hinted that an old friend should be MOH. Now I want old friend to be MOH. Might upset new friend if wrong in assumption. WIBTA?"
37,,WIBTA if I give back the Rolex my stepdad gave me?,35,m1zutz,41,"I (F29) was gifted a Rolex watch when I was 20/21 by my stepdad (SD) (M70+). He got one for me, and my brother. A very generous gift and at the time was greatly appreciated.Over the course of the 10 years my mum has been married to SD we have had a very fractious relationship. Initially we got along fine but as time passed it became apparent that he had some issues. He comes from a very wealthy background with many old fashioned views sexism, racism, ageism.. Every ism. He has fallen out with his own family about most of these subjects. I also believe he has some OCD tendencies surrounding things being done “his way”.I ended up living with them between 2012 - 2019. I will add that I am extremely grateful for all of this, however it did come at a cost.Specifically my relationship with SD began to struggle. I often felt like the emotional punching bag for him, he was emotionally abusive and I was never able to defend myself, was ignored or just shouted at. Even the smallest of household crimes (a sock on the floor) would to him be a heinous crime, punishable by shouting, rudeness, demoralising treatment.I admit I wasn't perfect in our relationship and did things to warrant a response (being slightly untidy at times) but his responses were becoming so extreme It has gotten to the point where I have pretty much cut him out of my life because of the distress he put me through. (Emotional trauma followed by nightmares and flashbacks). If I was a man it wouldn't be like this. The severity of these incidents increased when alcohol was involved - I was never physically attacked but often reduced to tears at how I was treated.I have had no support from my mum about stopping his behaviour. I would speak to her about this and tell her how hurt I was from his behaviour. The answers I received were: ""oh it's just how he is"" or ""He's old he won’t learn"" or ""But he's really a nice guy"". Over the years it's made me see how much of an enabler she was/is. She just wanted a ""happy family"" which meant a happy husband.**SO**I have had this Rolex for quite some time now. I don't wear it. I work in a profession needing to be bare below the elbows.One of the conditions set was that I wasn’t allowed to sell it. I don't even want the money for it. To me it's just a thing I don't use, and don't want. Especially as how my SD has treated me in the past, it's a pretty hollow gift in terms of sentiment.I think I will be TA in this because it may come across as ungrateful, but in reality i'm not grateful at all for the emotional abuse he's put me through for no reason.Can I give it back without being TA?"

She’s on a form of birth control that requires an appointment to be taken off of so theirs an “event” associated when we decide on the timing.But whenever me and my wife start discussing stuff, she immediately tells her family about it. So between my wife pestering me (lovingly) and her family always bringing it up - idk how I feel anymore cause I just feel pressured?Everyone respects my position and would never do anything without me being part of the discussion, I just feel like I can’t get ahold of my thoughts with everyone talking about it"
39,,AITA for not wanting to move in with my dad again,175,m1qgd5,20,"I'm 17F and live away from my parents, my dad recently asked that I move in with him and I said no.Growing up, my dad and I were pretty close. My mom's always been very quick to anger, she had a lot of mental health issues that just went untreated and it would be pretty shitty at home at times, but if we got into an argument my dad would always just be very comforting and she treated him badly too sometimes so we'd just have each other in a way. It just felt like was on my side. Then last year he left my mom, moved out, and I stayed behind with her. It didn't take long for her to get really bad and she ended up being institutionialized, and then I contacted my dad and he was like yeah let's tell the state you moved in with me, but here have some money find yourself a place to live. Which was not great, and maybe illegal, but I did not know what the hell was going on and I did in fact find myself a place to live after crashing on my friend's couch for like a month. Since then he's been regularly sending money to pay rent and basic necessities and such, he's been keeping in contact and been as nice as always. The place I live in is not particularly pretty but I get by and the upstairs neighbors have been great. And I guess being away from both of them has brought me to process my childhood a lot more than I could being at home, and my dad wasn't really that great. He was still the better parent, and I do think he tried, and he was kind and would like tell me I deserved better all the time, but a lot of me feeling like he was on my side was just him telling me that. I can't remember a single time he actually helped out with things like cooking or cleaning when she wasn't able to and I didn't know how. He'd go on and on about how she should be able to get past this and it wasn't fair to me and at least I had him but refuse to pay for a therapist for her when she asked. And anytime he was the one yelling and throwing shit it'd become this thing about how hard it was to live with my mother and I shouldn't take it personally, and like idk maybe I shouldn't but it felt awful. Either way, he's recently asked me to move back in with him, and I don't really... want to? Part of me is scared he'll just decide one day he wants me to find my own place again and I'll be back to couches, I guess. He's said he'll keep paying for my rent and stuff no matter what, but has very clearly expressed how ungrateful he thinks I am for saying I don't want to, and like he has been paying and I haven't had to get a job or anything and I guess I just feel really guilty that I don't want to live with him when from his perspective our relationship was fine last time we saw each other."
40,,AITA for not following my mom's rules?,31,m1ykjo,44,"Hi everyone-I feel like this is super petty, but here it goes. For background I am 27F and due to covid, I had to move back in with my mother to find work. Along with myself, my husband moved in with me and my sister who's still a college student (30sF) lives with her. To the story- I pay rent. I consider myself a roommate to everyone in this house cause I pay rent at the first of every month, for my room and to help with utilities. My mom on the other hand still sees me as a child despite me working and having two degrees. She feels I don't respect her. However, whenever something comes up, she goes for low blows, either calling me lazy or selfish, the list goes on. She's called me much worse things both now and through out my childhood but we won't go there.Last week I started a job in my field that's work from home. So to save money, I fix myself breakfast, lunch, and dinner at home as well as cook for my husband who has shift work. After every meal, I wash my dishes and put them in the dish drainer, and I 9 times out of 10 end up reusing the dishes in the next hour or so, either to make tea or whatever. My mom on the other hand routinely leaves dishes and food in the sink. Last week she left strawberry tops in the sink for five days. I did not clean this up due to the fact I was trying to show her that it is her mess in the sink, not mine. Last weekend she decided because the kitchen was a mess she's taking away the dish drainer and we are to wash, dry, and put up our dishes immediately. This wouldn't have pissed me off if it wasn't for her own dishes sitting in the sink for days. So I didn't say anything, I just laid out a towel, and put my dishes to dry on it.This morning it came to a head cause I found the dish drainer, I found it and put it on the counter, either promptly has been thrown away or hidden. Idk. I wasn't going to say anything but my sister told me to just talk to her, so I asked her where the dish drainer was. She started going about how ""we"" are going to do dishes for now on, etc, and I told her that Im not going to repeatedly put up a dish I use every hour when it can dry in the dish drainer. Then she decided to start calling me lazy, etc. I ignored her and just laid out another towel and put my dishes on it. I want to say something about her dishes being the ones that are in the sink as well as rotting food.  My sister just doesn't say anything. The thing is, I'm tired of everything being pinned on me or my husband (who she loves to blame for stuff cause she hates men.)  AITA for wanting to do dishes my way? In previous roommate relationships through out college we all did our own dishes or we had chores assigned- my mother seems to think that as her children we should just do it and do whatever she says without question.Edit: I had to take out some info due to character count so please let me know if you need more info."
41,,AITA for putting a baby monitor in the living room?,91,m1t83u,55,"So last april I had a baby and I wanted to have two close together so I'm having another one due this april. Problem is that my husband can't always babysit during an appointment so I have to ask his family to do it (my family lives 2 hours away)So we live with his grandma and tbh, when I've asked her to help a bit she falls asleep on the job and also drinks a lot. His mum does listen to what I say and is good with my baby. His dad has kinda brushed my opinions off in the past and done his own thing when taking care of her. The main problem is that they all have dogs and I don't allow the dogs to be in the same room as her as they can get lickey and snappy with baby. Obvs this gets ignored by grandma and his dad.So next week I have a scan which my husband can't cover and his mums busy too. The only people I have are the grandma and dad. Sooo... I put a baby monitor in the living room so I can watch her in my appointment (sometimes the wait is over an hour). I obviously have trust issues about my baby with them but now the grandma is very cross about the baby monitor and ""doesn't want to be spied on"" with baby. This makes me even more anxious about leaving her with them. I will change my appointment date due to husband not being free but I still need baby monitor for when I'm upstairs with new baby. The monitor only covers the part of the living room that baby is in. Aita for doing this?EDIT: I took the Camera down because I realised I was being an entitled asshole. I guess she has that right because its her home. She was very lonely in lockdown and lived with the last family member for 9 years and wanted us to live with her so it was a joint effort.Also the family knew we wanted two together that were close in age and the first was conceived before lockdown was a thing. She's been nice enough to allow me to use the baby monitor at times (ie going into labour) I see the light lol"
42,,AITA for telling my teacher I cant currently do anything about my purple forehead?,40,m1wz3n,36,"I, 16f, dyed my hair purple last night because I got a bit sad. The problem with purple is its messy, like very messy. I normally get all the stains off before I rinse dye out. Sometimes it rains on the way to school, today was that day. I didn't have a clean jacket so I just ran to school, and because my hoodie hood was useless, my ears, my neck,. my forehead and my school shirt collar Are purple and will be until I get home this evening. Not too noticeable but it's messy. My French teacher was pretty close to me, chewing me out for not having a minuscule part of my poster done, when she noticed that I'm like barney. She told me to go to the bathroom and wash my face. I told her I tried that but it didn't work ill just have to wait until I'm home and have my scrubby glove because tissue paper will just make it worse if i get near my hair line. Teacher was not happy with this, and said there must be something I can do and I said ""Miss, there's nothing I can currently do without making the issue worse"". She backed down, but the lad who sits next to me said I was acting like an asshole and should've just went and tried. AITA?"
43,,AITA for trying to find a balance between my wife's needs and my friends'?,28,m1yo7p,78,"When I (M) was young, my friend (Lesbian) asked me if I would one day donate sperm if she ever wanted to have kids, and because we were besties, I said yes. Years later, she's married to her dream girl (to whom I pressured her to speak, thank you very much), and I'm married to my dream girl. Problem is, my wife, who at first was supportive of my decision to donate sperm, is now completely against the idea. She says that she might compare our future kids (if we have any, hopefully) with my friends', and that is a valid reason for not helping my friends, and she says that I am not supportive of her for not instantly refusing when I know it might hurt her. Obviously, I feel like I don't understand my wife's point of view about the ownership of DNA, and I always want to help my friends, and I also understand that DNA is a tricky issue, so I wanted to ask you guys. If anyone out there in RedditLand has donated sperm/eggs, or their partner has, or even parent, I'd like to hear your perspective on this situation. I just wanna do the right thing. Am I the asshole for wanting help my friends have a kid with my DNA before I do with my wife?Thank you all"
44,,AITA for asking my husband to stop smoking CBD?,54,m1ufcv,54,"My husband used to be psychologically addicted to weed. I used to smoke a lot as well but I got a job that said they have the right to drug test us, so I quit because I felt like it wasn't worth it to lose my job over weed. I asked him to quit once he got a job that tests as well, he refused, and then a few months later he got a weed related felony charge and is now facing possible prison time or deportation. He has since switched to hemp, which is mostly CBD but does have a tiny amount of THC in it, enough to make you fail a drug test. He smokes it constantly and he has had a lot of stressful stuff in his life lately (the felony, also his dad died recently) so I think it's also become an unhealthy coping mechanism. I asked him to quit and he agreed and said he didn't have any more. A few days later I caught him smoking, I said I was upset that he lied to me, he said I'm sorry but I was just finishing off the last of it and I really don't have any more and I'll quit this time. The exact same thing has happened four times since then. I no longer believe him when he says he will stop smoking and that he doesn't have any more. He has also promised to see a therapist but never makes an appointment when he says he will. I'm fed up and tonight I'm making him sleep on the couch because I'm tired of his lies. I asked my parents and they told me I'm in the wrong and I'm being too controlling of him. I'm just worried about him losing his job and screwing us both over financially, which he says won't happen because he could buy fake pee if they test him. I'm also worried about his mental state and ability to cope with his problems without using substances. Please let me know if I'm in the wrong here."
45,,AITA for not answering the doorbell and now my wife went ballistic?,13,m24488,34,"My (26/m) wife (23/f) got mad that I didn’t answer the doorbell to our apartment building.We live in Eastern Europe on the third floor so when we get a ring it’s usually a drunk guy, someone locked out trying to get back in, or someone that has nothing to do with me. I get a ring about 3 or 4 times a week, and it never has to do with me, so I have decided to never click the button to let them in nor use the phone to hear who is downstairs.Now this morning I was home and my wife wasn’t. I got a ring to my apartment and I ignored it as usual. She then called me hours later and asked if my gift arrived, because she bought me a gift but I didn’t know the delivery date was today. Can someone please read this text exchange and let me know if I did something wrong.______Her: Did the postman bring the package?Me: I didn’t answer.He brought it to the door and you didn’t answer? No, outside apartment building.Why?Because I never answer What if they don’t bring it again? Ok I didn’t know. How am I supposed to know it’s your gift?I told you it would come on the 11th, it’s the 10th but whatever. You could have taken the call to see who it is, if it’s not for you, then just hang up. Did you get a call from the postman later?No.If they bring it tomorrow, please be nice and open the door. At the end of the day, it’s a gift I bought for you. Okay, Jesus Christ stop. I didn’t know it was a package Why are you angry? Is it my fault?Stop making me feel guilty Be a little more careful. Just accept that you were wrong, not “oh I didn’t know”. It’s not hard to say “I didn’t know dear, I’m sorry”. Not being wrong. As if I ordered you a package of shit.Are you ok?Why is it my fault? You’re saying it so rude as if it’s my fault that you didn’t open the door. You could have just said calmly....ok whatever...I already did say calmly that I didn’t know.Don’t be rude. You are very rude! Very!How?*she sends a screenshot of the texts I sent above, and I respond how I don’t see how my texts are rude, they are simply statements*Her: are you not feeling well?I didn’t know it was coming today....tell me how I should knowThen answer when they ring the apartment building. I also told you.You said March 11And tomorrow when they bring it you won’t answer againIt rings 3-4 times a week. I can’t answer it every time.Why, are you scared of the phone?No because it is always someone that has nothing to do with me. Ok forget it. And if they bring it tomorrow you’re not gonna open the door either. It’s ok.I have a doctor’s appointment tomorrow. Ok cool, let them receive the gift themselves. Just don’t be rude. Spitting on my gift. When did I spit on your gift? Jesus Christ Ok forget it.Tl:dr wife went mental over me not opening the door when I had no idea a gift was being delivered today"
46,,AITA [15M] for refusing to go see my other parent?,33,m1wsag,43,"I've made a previous post regarding my reasons for not wanting to see my dad, but now my mother also wants me to tell my dad the reasons why I don't want to see him. I was hoping my mother would just sort it out so I didn't have to have the conversation with my dad which I would be very uncomfortable with because it isn't easy to go ""I don't want to see you"" to someone you've known your whole life. My mom is also saying stuff like ""you're being mean"" and ""he's done nothing wrong to you"" mere weeks after I opened up to her about being unhappy at my dad's. I guess my question is, do I have to talk to him and tell him my reasons, and am I being unreasonable by expecting my mom to do most of it by helping me out. It just seems a lot that in my GCSE years, I'm expected to get top grades while also sorting out my relationship with my dad. I just don't want to go and that to be the end of it, wish I could avoid awkward conversations but I guess I have to?Edit: I'm happy to message him, but a call is just worse for obvious reasons but my mom wants me to do that so I'm basically being required to do that or else my dad is gonna come to the house in person. I'm not expecting my mom to do everything, but she has come out with stuff that has made feel like crap, it feels as though she is making my dad the victim and that I'm being mean and cannot just cut my dad out like this. Lowkey wish I was old enough to cut them both out for a few months, and I genuinely mean that but I guess from the outside looking in it's a kid who's being dramatic lol"
47,,AITA for mothering my boyfriend after surgery?,21,m21bqc,34,"My (28f) boyfriend (28m) got two of his wisdom teeth removed on Monday. When I got mine removed, I was not allowed to eat or drink anything containing milk, because the threads could dissolve and open the wound again. So my Bf ate nothing on Monday and soup and Baby Food yesterday. Today he said he would like to have beef with some kind of yoghurt sauce. I told him, I think this is not a good idea because of what I said above. He got super mad at me and told me I should stop to act like I was his mother and if I wanted him to call me „mom“. He said, IATA for mothering him and for destroying his evening, when he was looking forward to this meal. I was honestly just worried about the wounds opening up again. For some context: every morning I get up early, make him coffee, fix his meals for work and his drinks, and put all the stuff in his backpack, so he is ready to go. But he is totally fine with this. So AITA for telling him, yoghurt sauce wouldn’t be good for his wounds?"
48,,AITA for screaming at my roommate for accidentally poisoning me?,124,m1qkr9,85,"hey guys! you can call me S for the purposes of this, and I am 25 she/they. my roommate is D, 31 he/him.D and I are best friends, and we have been for several years. Recently we moved in together, and we are just now hitting the 1y mark on being roommates. you might think i'm implying something, i am not. we are strictly friends. Anyways, he is an amazing roommate, very organized and neat, respectful of my privacy and possessions, plus he's my friend so it's like hanging out 24/7. I am a bit messier, but i always manage to clean up the havoc i wreak upon our flat. this morning i was getting ready and spilled some foundation on my shower curtain (we have separate bedrooms+bathrooms) and i left it to clean after work, as i was rushed. apparently while i was gone D (he had the day off of work) went into my bathroom for some reason or another, noticed the foundation and decided to clean it. here's the thing, though. he scrubbed the foundation out of my shower curtain using a cleaning product... with my toothbrush. when he was done he left it, unrinsed on my sink, for me to find. I get home from work, we get takeout and watch a movie. when the movie was over i went to shower and brush my teeth. i noticed that it tasted off and it was foaming blue instead of white like my toothpaste does. so i went out (in my pajamas) to the living room where D was reading a book. I asked him if he had done anything to my toothbrush, to which he replied that he cleaned the foundation off with it. I thanked him but asked what he used. he replied cheerfully ""oxiclean!"" before his face fell and he realized what he did.naturally i was pissed and started screaming that he could've made me sick. (there was a large amount on the brush) and that he shouldn't have a) used my toothbrush for anything without my permission b) put CLEANING PRODUCTS on my toothbrush and c) not rinse my toothbrush after putting CLEANING PRODUCTS on it. he replied that he was just trying to help and said i was ungrateful, since jt worked. we got into an entire screaming match. here's the worst part: after this i ended up vomiting (maybe from stress, maybe from the fact i ingested oxiclean, probably both.) After I told D i wasn't feeling well and was physically ill he said i was overreacting and trying to make him feel bad. i ended up just going to bed. AITA??editing to say goodnight and thank you to all the kind people here. will update after i talk to him, but it's 2:17am here and i need some sleep."
49,,AITA for thinking my girlfriends adopted brother is overly affectionate with her?,16,m22tgz,22,"I’ve been dating my GF for 6 months. We’re freshmen in college. She’s really close to her family and although she lives in a student dorm she spends a lot of time at home since most of her classes are online (her family lives 20 minutes from our college) I’ve been to her house and met her family many times. She has a sister and 2 brothers. One of her brothers, Daniel was adopted from foster care. He’s been with them since he was 12. He’s 16 now.   So Daniel is a nice kid but he is VERY affectionate with her. He’s constantly hugging her, playing with her hair, kissing her cheek, making comments about her appearance. He does this all right in front of me. He also constantly sends her Snapchats and messages. He even has this cutesy nickname only he calls her.  It’s just so weird to me. I have a younger sister and this is not normal sibling behaviour. They are a very close family but her other (biological) brother does not do this with her. Daniel in general seems like a huge flirt and player. He also flirts with their older brother’s girlfriend constantly, however that’s not my business. But I feel his behaviour with my girlfriend right in front of me is my business though. I tried to talk to my girlfriend about it and she just acted like I was being ridiculous and insists “he’s like that with everyone.”  I tried to explain that I thought it was inappropriate but she got offended and said he was her brother and even implied I was racist since he is black and her family is white. I was not trying to be offensive but his behaviour bothers me. Now my girlfriend is mad at me because in her words “I’m attacking a harmless teenager”   I just don’t understand how being bothered by a guy kissing and constantly touching my girlfriend right in front of me and talking about how “fine” she is makes me an asshole.   AITA here."
50,,AITA for 'inconveniencing' my sister by not letting her lost dog in my car to drive back home?,18,m21ltd,123,"My sister and her family have a couple dogs and last week they lost one. Their Golden retriever Cairo. He just disappeared one afternoon and they weren't sure what happened to him. Tried looking around the neighborhood but he was nowhere to be seen. Anyways, I was on my way back home from the gym yesterday when I saw a dog that looked like Cairo next to this bench with a guy. I got out and called for him and he came running almost immediately. A bit dirty but otherwise still his good ol' self. Asked the guy if it was his dog and he said he just found him here. Strange thing is that he didn't have his collar but it was definitely him. To make triple sure I took a picture of him and sent it to my sister who also confirmed that this was Cairo and asked me to take him to her house for her. The only problem with that is that I have a rather strict no dog policy in my car. I only got it last year and I had nothing at all to try cover the seats to avoid them getting dirty.So I told my sister I couldn't but said I'd wait for her or her husband there with Cairo till they came. She didn't really like that plan and kept asking me to just take him to their house since they're both at work. I said I didn't mind waiting a bit and the call ended. 5 minutes later she called again asking if I was still there or if I dropped him off. Said no and she hung up. Then after 15 minutes she came, picked him up and left without saying a single word to me. Late last night I guess she finally boiled over and called to complain about what a shitty guy I am for making her leave work to get Cairo when I could've just dropped him off causing a big inconvenience for no reason. I honestly didn't mind waiting for however long till either of them came but Cairo in my car was a definite no. AITA?"

We are 4 months further now and she has not payed me back, meanwhile she has the money to keep doing her expensive hobby. But when i ask ''hey is it possible to pay me back'' she says she has no money and that i am rude to ask my money back. I see her doing expensive things and buying expensive things. I don't know what to do but she makes me feel like i am the asshole for asking my money back. Also i don't even know how to get my money back."
52,,AITA for wanting my grandmas religious items after she passes even though I’m not religious?,15,m221vw,40,"My grandma is 92. She has asked my mom to make a list of who gets what when she passes to avoid arguments. My mom and her siblings have already decided what they want and now she’s moving on to the grandkids. I am the youngest, however I have the closest relationship with our grandma (we Skype everyday for about 45 minutes while my cousins call maybe once every 6 months) so my grandma wants me to pick what I want first. I chose her religious items (grandma is a born and raised catholic), some of which I bought her when I visited the Vatican a few years ago. I was confirmed catholic however I have since left the church and am no longer religious. I picked these items because they mean everything to my grandma and I want them because I know it’ll help me feel close to her after she’s gone. She is happy that those were what I picked to have. One of my cousins found out what I picked and she is pissed because she’s still a practicing catholic and she believes she should have all of grandmas religious items because she will use them. She also said she’s older than me so she should get to pick before me. AITA if I stick to my guns and keep the religious items for myself?"
53,,AITA for not wanting to invite my fiance's friend?,30,m1x7rk,24," Me and my partner are planning to get married in two years. We are currently in a long distance relationship so we didn't start properly planning the wedding yet. I am planning to move to his country later this year.. We lived together before in different places for a longer period of time but I never really had the chanche to get to know his friends properly. This one lady in particular I only met once when she was so hangover she refused to talk to me. Some time ago she arrived to my partner's place to pick up something while we were on a video chat and right after she said hello to me (I didn't even had the chance to answer) she turned to my partner and asked him if I was able to understand her. Mind you, my first language is not English but I did my master degree in the UK so my English is quite good (IELTS 8 good exactly). I am still rather insecure about it so that comment really hit close to home eventho I know she was just being ignorant. But it is nothing to what happened next. As she said goodbye and started to leave she turned around facing the camera and just told me that btw she's gonna be a groomsman at our wedding. Not asking, blatantly stating that this is going to happen. I got so confused I couldn't say anything but I aksed my fiance about it and he said she must have been joking (she is known to be a bit weird sometimes like that) so I let it go.More recently (this is what my fiance told me) her and my fiance met at a party and straight off the bat she was demanding that she'd be a groomsman at our wedding. Her reasoning was that my fiance is her only close male friend who is not yet married and this is her last chance to be a groomsman. My fiance got very frustrated but didn't wanna have an arguement with her at the party (she can also get very emotional when something doesn't happen her way) so he just asked her not to talk about it now.A very weird addition to the mix is that her and my fiance used to date. It was like 10+ years ago and only for about 6 months, they've been very good friends since and both of them have been dating others (this woman is actually married already). So I was never worried about her in that sense but her demanding to have a very prominent role at her exes wedding doesn't sit right with me at all. I don't even know why is it so important for her?So all of this  made me really frustrated and both me and my fiance agreed that she won't be invited to our wedding at all. I am a bit concerned that my partner agreed to it cause he's more concerned about how I feel then wheather he actually wants her to come or not. I am very worried that she will get very angry and cause a scene when we tell her that she is not only not gonna be a groomsman but she is also not invited to the wedding. I feel like an asshole cause I know she will get very emotional and sad over it."
54,,"AITA for "" ruining"" my ex best friends relationship with her family?",11,m22k2y,36,"A little context first of all she's a year and a half older than me ( she'll be 19 in may) and has a mental disability because when her mom was pregnant with her the mom did some fucked up drugs. Her mom and dad are divorced and has an unofficial step mom ( haven't married) because her dad is a trucker so his work could take like a few days to almost a month at a time. Because of her disability ( which is purely learning ) everybody will drop everything to give her what she wants. Lately over social media, school, and her work she's been bashing her unofficial stepmom and bio dad because they're making her pay rent. I was the only person of about 200 or so people she's told that's told her unofficial stepmom. Am I the asshole for telling her stepmom and dad about this with screenshots from her social medias?????"
55,,AITA For telling my boyfriend that he doesn’t need a new mic,13,m237jm,23,"So I’m 18F and he’s 17M. He doesn’t have a job, and his only source of income is either his grandmother or helping his mom with work. Recently he opened a checking account and got a debit card and he’s been spending a lot of money.When he opened his account his grandmother gave him around 1.5k, after everything he has bought he is at around 400 in the span of about 2 months. He doesn’t have any bills to pay, so I know that the money isn’t going there. He’s spent some on me as well, which I try to urge him not to. He used to stream on twitch, but stopped, he wants to start again though. He said he needs a new camera and a new mic because he thinks his picks up too much background noise. I’ve told him that it doesn’t, but even still a more expensive mic (the one he wants is about $130 more than his current mic) won’t solve the problem. And that what he needs is a noise dampening program. I know this because I needed a mic and my dad works in advertising so he had a really nice expensive Samson to give me and it still picks up background noise without changing any settings. I said that he needs to be more careful with what he spends his money on and he got even more upset saying that I shouldn’t tell him what to do.He also wants to buy a new gaming chair and camera, even though his current camera shoots in HD, and I have a 4K one I could give him that he doesn’t want. He has a professional gaming chair, and he just wants a new one because he doesn’t like when his chair makes small squeaks, which is why he says he needs a new one. And on top of everything he wants to buy a $400 oculus just to play a VR chat game with his friends, one console, for one game. It bothers me how frivolous he is with his money, if he had a stable income I wouldn’t have a problem, even if it was a job at McDonald’s or something. But he doesn’t care and just continues to be annoyed with me when I tell him. It’s not even like I’m getting mad at him or forcing him to do anything, all I do is suggest he not buy those things now and instead wait until he has an actual job.AITA?"
56,,AITA for being in a stable my friend doesn't like,15,m213xw,25,"Me (25f) and my friend (23f) met in stable A. We have different experience with horses. I am more careful, I want calm, older, small horses and my friend has no problems riding young, jumpy, big brown horses. We started at stable A, and I had a great time. My friend was struggling a bit, as stable A has a bad environment. It went great if you thought before speaking or had filter. I never say anything unless I have to and have no problem with the people there, she does not. She is very outspoken and has no filter. Great at times, but not when the people around you makes things worse (talking behind her back and taking things out of context). After some time we decided to get a lease horse together. She had her issues but my friends were great with her and I liked her a lot while we were at stable A. My friends were not happy at stable A, mostly because of the other people there witch I can understand. We knew some people at a nearby farm where we could build our own stable. I told them beforehand I most likely would not be happy in stable B, but gave them the okay after a while, as I don't want them to be unhappy. We built the stable and stayed there for a few months. I was really not happy and bearly did anything on my days. I told them both that I was unhappy and could no longer afford it as I had to get a new car. My friend has moved about 1hr away.I miss having a lease horse but have a hard time finding one I can get comfortable with. I have gotten a lot better and I got the opportunity to have one at stable A again.My friend told me that I shouldn't have gone back there prinsipically because she had a hard time there. I told her I liked it there and had no other choice because as far as I could see there were just three stables in the area and C did not have leasehorses, I was not happy at stable B and that only left stable A. I told her I did not want to discuss it, but she would not let it go and in the end I said that if I were to respect her wishes I wouldt have any places to go. She got offended and thought I meant everyone in our town is against her, and that there were atleast 20 stables to go to. I told her my reasoning for A, B and C and asked her what other stables she thought I could go to (not being able to ride every hose as she does). Apparently that had nothing to do with the discussion, and she would not tell me any other stables. Horses had nothing to do with the case that I talked down about her, but she does not want to hear an explanation. Everything was written, and I get stressed when we argue over text (as she knows) and I have no time to think about what to write. In the end I told her, she was not interested in hearing an explanation and thus I had no idea what else to say. She told me she was tired of being the one put down and people not taking responsibility for what they say,and that she was tired of trying. I just answered K, and we haven't spoken a word since. AITA?"
57,,AITA for pestering my parents for a Tesla,21,m1xz7u,101,"I am pestering my parents for a TeslaMy (17) parents promised me that they would buy me a Model 3 as long as I maintained all As and got a 34 on the ACT. I had never asked them for a brand new car, a luxury one at that. All I asked for was the car they already had, a Nissan Rogue that was 5 years old. I never once said “will u buy me a luxury car in exchange for good grades”. The only reason I asked my parents for the already present Nissan was that they were already planning on getting a new car soon, so I wanted to have the one that was just going to sit there.Well, I got really lucky on my ACT score and got the 35, and have all As in all my classes. I never thought I was actually going to get such a high score, considering I never once took a practice exam or anything in preparation (which is why I think my parents set such a high target for a new car, because they assumed it was impossible for me to hit).So I asked my parents to buy me the car, that they had promised me on numerous occasions on the conditions of grades and tests scores. My parents are now saying no to the car now because I am a new driver, so I am going to be a risky driver, and this is for my benefit. I have now asked them on a daily basis to purchase the car, even though I knew it was a empty promise from the beginning. (My parents are very well off, so money isn’t an issue at all here). My parents are now saying that I’m just being an entitled brat, and that no child is entitled to a high end car. I feel right in my entitlement however because I fulfilled my end of their deal, and I now want them to fulfill their end of it. I think I might be an asshole here because that really is a extravagant thing to demand, especially at my age and lack of driving experience."
58,,AITA for telling my girlfriend she needs to actually try to help herself?,15,m20pm4,24,"So there's a long backstory here and I'll try to sum it up as much as possible. Basically my gf (16), and I (17) have known eachother for a few years now and had been dating for about a month or 2 when this happened. I've always been the person that everyone vents to, and the worst of it was when I couldn't go a week without having to talk my friends down from unaliving themselves. I've kind of accepted this role as a friend/bf. It's been a lot better recently but I'm not one without issues. I have severe C-PTSD, so I also vent but I make it known that I'm not looking for anything other than sympathy in the moment, mostly because I have a therapist I see every week. Another bit of of information is that all of this is online as we live in different states.So my gf struggles with a lot. We're both teenagers so that's to be expected. I, having been in therapy since I was 10 and also taking a large interest in psychology, have done my absolute best to comfort her and help her find techniques to help herself. I've also encouraged her many times to get a therapist herself, and from what she's told me, she absolutely could find one since she has insurance, if it was in person, her mom could take her, and if it was teletherapy she has her own room so she wouldn't have to worry about privacy. There's really no issue with money or time but the problem is she just will not actually talk to her mom about, well, anything. She has a lot of issues regarding her parents, but she's directly told me that her mom would like to get counseling or therapy for all of them, it just never happened.So, my gf continues to struggle and I continue to be the person who she vents to. It became an everyday thing, and sometimes even multiple times a day, she would come to me. I understood and tried to comfort her. Still, I have my own trauma and it gets worse in november, and even worse in December. She's aware of this too. Still, every day from around mid November all the way up until mid January, when I finally come to the core issue, it continued.  She was venting to me about her social issues and, I was giving her tools that I used since I used to struggle with similar things. It wasn't the exact same issue, but the issue could absolutely be helped the same way. I don't like saying she makes excuses, but she does and for a while she keeps both avoiding my help and then saying she has done everything she can.So I said""forgive me because this might sound rude and I don't mean it to be but I really don't think you've tried all you can. You're going to an extreme when clearly there are other options. You're taking the easy option of not doing anything."" because that's exactly what she was doing, and has been for years. after that, she ghosted me and refuses any contact I tried to make with her. It was my birthday a few days ago and she didn't even come online to say hi. I know she's doing fine because I play D&D with her brother but I dunno. Am I the Asshole?"
59,,AITA for buying my kids a coffee from Starbucks and not Costa?,34,m1v1ml,38,"Note: This is my son's account but from my, his father's point of view as I don't feel the need to create my own account.So, today I (M43) went to the dump because we needed to move some stuff to the dump because we recently got our loft renovated and there's a lot of timber, so it took a whole week. My son (M13) has been helping me all week and managed to get good scores in his tests, and I checked to see if it was true. Yesterday was the last day we went to the dump and my daughter (F15) helped on the last day. Once it was all finished. I asked my son if he wanted to get a coffee as a reward for helping (Note: I gave him some money as for every exceeding grade he gets, I give him £30, and he got a fair few exceeding marks) He said he would like to go to Starbucks but then my daughter got angry and said she wanted to go to costa. I told her that my son had been helping more so he gets to choose. She then goes into a bad mood until we get there. We all order except her then once we are given our drinks, she whacks them out of both of our hands. Me and my son were very annoyed so we got in the car, drove her home, then went back, just us two to get drinks again. When we got home, my wife was angry at me for not listening to my daughter since she was older. I told her my son deserved to choose as he actually helped me out the most. My daughter and wife both won't speak to me, so, AITA?"
60,,AITA for lecturing my partner when they interrupt me?,15,m20hyt,23,"I really hate being interrupted when I'm telling a story or a joke. I like to tell jokes in a way that during the setup, it seems like I'm talking really straight. If I get interrupted at this point and don't get to finish, my meaning or intention can be totally misconstrued. It can be frustrating and difficult to recover the joke or conversation.I know that interrupting is not generally intentional. If it's obvious that it was accidental and the interrupter stops talking right away or apologizes, or if the interruption didn't actually impact my meaning, then I just let it go without saying anything. However, I still think it's very disrespectful.Earlier today, my partner interrupted me in the middle of a story. I was taking some creative liberty to transform it into a joke, but it was clear that I wasn't claiming that my retelling was totally true. Before I could get to the punchline, my partner interrupted me to tell me how it *actually* happened. I felt like they thought I was so dumb I couldn't remember, or maybe that I was just outright lying, and then I didn't feel like the joke made sense to tell anymore.It made me really angry, and so I told them ""I would love to make it all the way to the punchline even one time,"" which was admittedly pretty passive aggressive. I went on to say how disrespectful I thought it was to interrupt people, and that even though we've argued many times in the past and they know that being interrupted is my pet peeve, they still do it on a regular basis. In this instance, they got really angry and told me that they are ""sick of being lectured."" They feel that everyone gets interrupted and don't understand why I make a big deal out of it.I do call my partner out every time they talk over me, and I can see how that's frustrating, think I do let the accidental interruptions go every time. I think it's so condescending when they interrupt and just keep talking, so I don't think I should just let it go, but I could be wrong. A friend and I talked about similar situation recently, and they agreed with my partner. However, that friend also interrupts me (and others) often, and frequently talks over people, so I think they might be biased.Am I the asshole for making a big deal out of interruptions?"
61,,AITA for making my MIL cover her white dress with a sweater at my wedding?,9,m24vny,21,"I got married Saturday and MIL showed up in a white dress for some reasons beyond her control. She is currently eight and a half months pregnant, so it isn't like she had a bunch of options, and her foot got put in a boot for an ankle injury a few days before the wedding and said she couldn't walk right in the floor length dress. I tried not to be a bridezilla because obviously I don't want her to trip when she is heavily pregnant, but she showed up and immediately started screaming at me that this is the only dress she has and if I don't like it she will leave, because she is sick of ""our shit"" which she didn't elaborate on.I said that was fine, but I asked her to wear a sweater that my mom had to offset the white dress. MIL started to cry and said that I was being mean to her and she doesn't want to look like a ""sunday school teacher"" We bickered over it, and she ended up putting the sweater on while she cried, but she came up to me during the reception and threw the sweater at me, and said that her husband told her to take it off, and he is furious with me. My husband told her to just leave, so MIL left and her husband posted something snarky on social media, about imagine being so insecure that you let some petty shit ruin your wedding and he predicts a divorce. Now no one is talking. I don't know if I overreacted because she wasn't wearing anything crazy like a wedding gown."
62,,WIBTA if I backed out of paying for a hotel with my friends?,27,m1valo,32,"I feel like an AH just thinking about it and wanted to ask some anonymous strangers about it. Next Monday is my best friend from childhoods birthday. We planned on having dinner for her birthday, which is already booked and I plan on attending even if I don’t end up staying the night. One of the things my friend wants to do is get a hotel room and spend the night there all together. We found a hotel a little distance from all of our homes and closer to the restaurant. I helped plan the majority of this and found pretty much every place we looked at. I’m not sure how I got stuck with planning it and I don’t mind doing so but I’m getting burned out as most of the original ideas didn’t pan through. All of us are struggling college students so we aren’t terribly rich, and because we are all under 23 AirBnb wouldn’t rent to us due to fears of a party. We tried pretty much everything besides lying about our age. I spent two days trying to convince my friend that the Airbnb wouldn’t work out but she wanted one because it was more private and we wouldn’t have to worry as much about being loud. I respect her opinion and tried to find other places but they were all far too expensive. Now that we are looking at the hotel, the room live is 89$ per night, but that’s only one room and I’m still trying to figure out if people want to get another room which could be about two times that at least. I’m by no means rich. I’m unemployed due to covid and I’m starting to get worried about my finances. I am terrible when it comes to saving money and I’m worried about overspending. I’ve already bought her a separate gift and the restaurant meal prices can be 20-30 dollars depending on what I get. I talked about it with my mom a few minutes ago and she said I would be fine and my friends would understand, but the guilt has been eating me alive. I feel terrible that I want to skip out on them like that.I’ve been considering it, but would I be the AH if I told them I could no longer stay at the hotel? Between the people going they would be spending less on the hotel even if they got a second room."
63,,"AITA for telling my stepmom that she’s wrong thinking it’s better for me to drive around with $1,000+ in tool rather than buying a $500 toolbox?",137,m1mxqs,48,"I’m a 21m auto technician who is also a full time college student, because of me being in college I currently live with my parents. Specifically my dad and stepmom. My parents are controlling it but it bluntly, they tell me I’m not allowed to spend money on most things, I know they mean well by trying to get me to save my money but, as an auto technician I pay for my own tools.I, before tonight only had a small toolbox I’ve used for the past 6 months. It gotten full to the point to were I had to buy a bigger toolbox. Tonight I went home to get some cash I had saved away for my work experiences so I can go and buy my new box. But when I got home and got my money my stepmom asked what I was going to buy. Now I told her the truth and said “I’m going to the store to buy a bigger toolbox.” When I told her that she started asking why I need a bigger box when I bought one not to long ago. I tried to explain to her my reason for needing a bigger box, but she didn’t want to listen to what I was saying.The argument she said was “You should just put your tools in your car so you don’t have to get a new box.” That’s when I told her she was wrong thinking it’s a good idea for me to drive around in my car with over $1,000 in tools than for me to get a bigger box. The only thing she told me is that after is that “I think what you’re doing is a bad decision.” After she said that I left and went to the store and bought my toolbox.I’ve expected that when I live with my parents that I can’t go out and buy my “fun” stuff, such as parts to build my first gaming pc. Stuff like that can wait until I move out, but I believe that if I need to buy something for work I’m the only one who needs to make that decision."
64,,AITA or refusing to pray for my struggling family?,8,m244td,16,"Hey, so, I don't exactly consider myself as an atheist, but by being repeatedly forced to go to church and do religious activities against my will for years, my faith deteriorated a lot, so much so that I'm pretty much atheist by now, although I still have that anxiety and fear of god. My mom is a very religious person, and, one day, she decided that we had to pray half an hour every day for a week. I said no multiples times but she forced me anyway and said it was for the family and that I was being really selfish and self centered to not pray. I told her that it would work just as good without me, that I could stay if they wanted my company or even help the family in other ways, but she said that there was nothing else and that I had to pray, that it was an exeption, only half an hour for a week. Honestly, it felt horrible. now, she decided to do it again but for a month this time, with no warning and of course, no way to refuse. I did refuse multiple times, trying my best not to be agressive in any way, just asking her if she could do it with my brothers without me, and now she is accusing me of wanting to cut everything with the family, and said that I was killing her, because of her tension. One night I resisted more, which means just asking her more and walking slower to the place where we pray. Again, I said that I could help in other ways or that they could pray without me, with no success. When we prayed, I could hear the tears in her voice so I raised mine so she could hear me worship and not cry. Today, she told me that the family was going through a lot and that I was being selfish for not praying, that I was always the one going against everything and ruining stuff, (I'm the weird kid at home.) and that her tension was to 17 because of what happened last time. It's really tough for me, I really love her, and I don't want her to be harmed or die because of my beliefs. Am I the Asshole for refusing to pray for my struggling family?"
65,,AITA If i told someone to not be rude to an ER doctor for not knowing what’s exactly wrong with them?,11,m20v8g,27,"So this is me being just kind of a know it all but I was texting a friend the other night and she disappeared. She hits me up the next morning to say she went to the ER. Obviously concerned I ask what was up and she told me her symptoms. The symptoms wore and I quote “pale, dizzy and stumbling” I was like oh wow that sounds awful. She then proceeded to mention that they ran all this blood work and did her EKG and did an IV drip of Saline (which correct me if I’m wrong but I’m sure Is standard ER procedure). All of her tests showed up okay and everything seemed normal. She said she had a 99.2-99.8 temp which I thought was above average but not “worrisome”. I’ve seen her mention how she’s working and she also has all this stress from trying to apply to schools to get into a writing program. So I suggested she just might be having a severe anxiety attack. She mentioned she was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome as well. With all that said I asked her what she would want the doctors to do for her and she responded with “find out what’s wrong with me. Basically their job” and I said “I’m so sorry that’s happening to you but you want to re-read what you said because that’s really harsh to say” and she just said I’m done with this conversation. Am I the asshole for saying something?"
66,,WIBTA if I threw away all my roommates food that's been sitting on our balcony in the heat?,8,m23fg0,11,"So one of my roommates takes up a crazy amount of room in the freezer/fridge, because of this he decided to put a few bags of food out on the balcony (we live in Wisconsin, the winter was pretty freezing). However, he never brought the food back in when things have warmed up. It's been consistently above 35 for the last 2 weeks, and the last 3 days in a row it has been sunny and around 60 degrees. My other roommate thinks we should trash the food as it's definitely bad by now, and we know he will try and put it on our fridge/freezer despite this. We've told him twice now he has to do something about it before it rots out there, but we don't get along well, so he hasn't said anything back to us. Would we be the assholes if we trashed his food that's out there? It's stuff like peta bread and beans."
67,,AITA for telling my daughter and sister slurs are never okay to say?,8,m23a10,32,"I’m posting this for my sister who doesn’t have a Reddit account. The rest of the post is her talking.Both my daughter (14f) and sister (15f) are bisexual, and I accept and support them both 100%. The problem came about when my daughter was called the f-slur while on a date with a girl. When telling the story, she said the actual slur. I referenced the story at a later time, and I said the slur just so they would know what word I was talking about (neither of them say “f-slur” and consider the “f word” to be the f-bomb, so I wasn’t sure they’d know what word I meant unless I said it outright). Both girls flipped out on me. I reminded them that they had both said the word before, and I wasn’t calling anyone by the name, I was using it for educational purposes (which my sex and gender class from college had said was the only acceptable use of the word). They told me that it was okay for them to say the word because they were part of the LGBT community and that I couldn’t say it because I’m not part of the community. I told them that being part of the community doesn’t mean it’s okay to say the word, that using the word outside of educational purposes was just spreading the hate behind the word. They doubled down their opinion and we argued about it for a bit.I let it go to keep the peace (and I wasn’t going to be changing their minds anytime soon), but I stand by what I said. But I’m starting to wonder if iwta for arguing my point when I’m not LGBT myself, that maybe I should’ve stayed in my own lane. So Reddit, AITA for arguing against the use of slurs?EDIT: I’m not sure if it matters, but I’m part Hispanic and was raised heavily in Hispanic culture (particularly Mexican culture). I used to think it was okay to use Mexican slurs because I was one, but I’ve realized that all it does is continue the cycle of hatred.Also, my sister (the owner of this account) is gay, and while she sides with me, I wanted a broader perspective/opinion, so asked her to post this for me. All replies are my words, not hers, just to be clear."
68,,AITA for getting mad at my mom because she wants to control what I wear?,7,m22qey,52,"This probably won't be a big deal to everyone, but I want the reddit opinion. Tw: religion mentionsSo, I (24 ftm) put on loose leggings and a hoodie to go out today. Mom saw me and told me to go change because the leggings are too tight and the hoodie is too warm. I understand the hoodie part, but the leggings are loose on me. My sister on the other hand is almost 100lbs lighter than I am and is allowed to wear skin tight leggings as pants wherever she goes.This isn't the first time clothes issues have come up either. I'm not allowed to wear a comfortable dress I own that's modest, but tightish, even with leggings because Mom has decided that it's too tight on me. And half of the styles I want to wear, my mom has told me not to wear because she doesn't like them. Mom fussed me for buying a women's suit because it makes me look too masculine and she got mad at me for wearing a hoodie and sweats to run over to a family friend's house to pick up instructions for dogsitting. I've watched their children and pets before, but Mom said her worry is that the one time I wear sweats will cause the friend to not want to recommend me for a job if the opportunity comes up. And even when I dress up, it's not good enough for Mom. She wants me to dress like her when I want to be able to move and function like normal in fancy clothes. I was raised Southern Baptist, and my Mom is so strict about religion that I can't wear peace signs because ""peace won't come until the rapture happens"", I can't wear rainbows because ""the gays have corrupted it"", and I can't wear skulls because that's ""worshipping death"". If shorts or a skirt is shorter than my fingertips when my hands are at my side, I can't wear them. And I can't wear anything that may show cleavage at all. Also, this has come up with makeup as well. I'm not allowed to wear black eyeliner because it makes me ""look angry"" and I'm not supposed to wear my fun lipstick colours because my parents don't like it and they don't like my cuff earrings either. Am I the asshole for being mad that I'm not allowed to wear what I want? Also, I live with my parents I'm saving to get out, but it's going to be after I finish grad school."
69,,AITA for voicing my frustrations to my friend who was struggling?,9,m20nhs,6,"(This is off my phone I apologize for any spelling errors)So I (F18) and the rest of my friend group who range from 18-21 year olds have been planning on living in a house for about a year. My best friend (F20) signed onto the lease months ago, and so did a couple of other people. A couple of weeks ago, our whole friend group had a huge spat over something that had really nothing to do with over half of the people involved. The friend group got dismantled and that’s when issues arose with the living situation.  Certain people didn’t want other certain people to be living with them and vice versa. My boyfriend voiced his concerns about how it would work out financially as he and I would be paying for car, insurance, etc. The issue was that it depended on my best friend at the time and we had 2 other tenants lined up if she were to drop off the lease. So my boyfriend wanted me to talk to her about it. When I was with her last night, she noticed I was frustrated and asked me why. I told her I was stressed about the living situation and that my boyfriend was very concerned about his financials as well as others weren’t wanting her under the same roof as other tenants that may be living there. She concluded that no one cared about her, including myself because “I was only concerned about my stresses” she said that I didn’t care because she lost all of her friends in 48 hours the week before and she wasn’t ok. I just didn’t bring up that whole situation because she didn’t. Anyways, she drove me home and I talked to my boyfriend about what happened and then he talked to her and another friend and that’s when she texted me that we were no longer friends when I have no idea what I did. When I asked her she just said it was clear I never cared when I feel like she just wanted me to put aside my issues for her. I just want some clarity on this situation because I feel like I always took on her issues as my own to a fault."
70,,AITA for getting annoyed at my friend for calling me patronizing?,10,m20i7i,56,"I (21F) got into a little disagreement with this friend (19F). We call relatively often and she shares stuff about her day throughout these calls. She recently told me (on call) that she found a pasta brand that she’s really enjoying. Just a few days ago, she brought it up again when I asked what she was eating. I responded with “awww, you’re a big fan huh?” Because I find her CUTE &amp I’m glad she’s found something she enjoys that much. She didn’t like my response. She replied with “yeah I’m a big fan of pasta....very aww indeed”. I got irritated because this was about the third or fourth time that she’d mock either something I said or the way I said it, so I told her I would go do something else instead of calling her (which we had planned to do). She was surprised and said “no one wants to call me”. I told her that I did want to, but that I don’t like being mocked. She responded by saying she doesn’t like patronized. I got even more irritated because I didn’t understand why she’s so adamant on reading my messages in a condescending or disrespectful tone. Just a few days ago, after another altercation, she had told me that I think I know how people are feeling when I’m really just projecting my own assumptions onto them. I messaged her after /this/ incident and told her that /she/ should also stop assuming what my tone is like. It’s been about a day and a half and she hasn’t responded. Am I the asshole?"
71,,AITA for my very specific birth plan?,78,m1orz3,181,"I (22f) am due with my first baby in 3 months and have been planning my birth since I got pregnant. I have a history of trauma so I wanted to make sure that my consent was not going to be ignored. I have been working with a doula who will be with my husband (26m) and I when I give birth to help prevent any doctors from damaging me without my consent. Before anyone thinks I’m crazy here is what I am firm on. I want to give birth in a standing squat position or something similar, no epidural, I want to eat and drink during labor, no episiotomies, no cervical checks, no continuous monitoring, only a female OB and nurses, I am exclusively formula feeding after birth, but I am doing delayed cord clamping/bathing, and before anyone touches me I want them to tell me what they want to do and I want to give my verbal consent or non consent. I am super pro medicine, don’t get me wrong (MPH in epi loving my life rn with covid) but I am aware of how most of the time women aren’t listened to when we are this vulnerable. (This is barring actual medical emergencies) ANYWAYS, my family and my husbands family disagrees with everything I have planned. Every time I speak to them they say I am as bad as anti maskers because I don’t trust doctors and that they know more than me about what needs to happen in childbirth. They think I need to try breastfeeding and that I’m harming my baby by not breastfeeding, they think I’m harming my baby by going back to work after my maternity leave is up. It goes on and on and on. It got to the point where I was on the phone with my family and they were saying that I need to be prepared to just let the doctors do whatever they want with me when I’m in labor because they know what to prioritize and I just lost it on them. I told them they can fuck off, I don’t owe them any explanations and I can do whatever I want becuase it’s not their kid. I was told I was very out of line and my parents called my husbands parents about it. Now everyone is acting oh so concerned about me and my baby and are saying I’ve lost it and that I’m disrespectful and don’t know right form wrong anymore. I don’t think I’m the asshole but I have very strong emotions over most things so I figured it was a good idea to check. So am it he asshole for ignoring what my families are telling me/ what some doctors say/ yelling?"

Now that we have been together for awhile I would like him to meet my dad, especially since he’s the only parent I really have. My boyfriend has told me that he doesn’t want to meet my dad because it’s scary to meet your girlfriends dad . I will admit that lately I have been asking him constantly to meet my dad because I think that it is absolutely ridiculous of him not to meet my dad just because he thinks it might be scary, maybe I’m being a little to harsh and maybe I should let it go. Am I the asshole?"
73,,AITA for asking my estranged family to let me know personally when members of that side of the family die?,6,m24iet,12,"I've(26f) been almost entirely no contact with my biological father's(60m) family since I was 12. He's very emotionally abusive and destructive and he did a serious number on my mental health. When I was 12 my mom got fed up and said he couldn't see me anymore. Because he had never payed child support there wasn't much he could do about it. I always thought that when I turned 18 is go looking for him but, I realized that I really liked not being abused so I just didn't. I stayed away and everyone who knows anything about my family approves of the decision. For their part, his family refused to have anything to do with me unless I had a relationship with my father. He has serious mental illness (which I inherited) that he refused to treat and very severe physical health issues (kidney failure multiple heart attacks ect.) And has been living in my aunt(53f)'s home for the last 20ish years. Over the weekend his mother died. I found out because of a post from my aunt's facebook.  The same thing in happened last year when my cousin died but I figured that was different because it was her child. I reached out and offered my condolences. This time I did the same but asked that in the future she notify me about deaths in the family, in particular to notify me about my father's death. He's been telling me that he has six months to live since I was 7.My aunt called me and let me know when her father died, and my biological called and let me know when  his grandmother died, so I kinda had precedent. I went looking online for the funeral home that my grandmother would be at so I could send flowers and saw that while my cousins were mentioned in our grandfather's obituary I was not.Yesterday I got a very angry message from my cousin (23f) telling that I'm not part of the family and that her grandmother never knew or considered me family. It continues on in that vein formally disowning me, a person she hasn't seen in 15 years.She was angry because I had contacted her mother to ask that in the future I not have to find out about family deaths over social media.  I think that I have the right to know, especially when my direct relatives die and I want to set precedent because my father is likely the next death. She blames me for not having had a relationship with her side of the family.Am I the asshole?"
74,,WIBTA for reporting a student who recorded a teacher’s video and put it on Instagram?,6,m22pmb,11,"I’m in ninth grade. I don’t have Instagram but a lot of my friends do. A girl from grade eight recorded a video of her teacher teaching during online classes and uploaded it. She replaced the original audio with some stupid rap song. Her friend reposted the story. A friend of mine knows this girl, she recorded the story and sent it to me. It is disgusting that these girls are violating the privacy of our teacher, who is a very nice person, for their fun. I would never want that to happen to me or anyone. Being secretly recorded and people leaking that is a very big fear of mine. But I don’t know if I should report it or not? I mean I know I should but I don’t wanna act all petty and like a teacher’s pet. Specially since I don’t even know these girls. While my friend was also disgusted by their antics, she is too scared to report it. So I have to choose between breaking ‘girl-code’ and acting like an uncool teacher’s pet or letting someone violate a teacher in the most disgusting way. WIBTA if I didn’t act cool and chill and report it? English isn’t my first language so please don’t mind my grammatical errors."

Since we adopted her Maui has been causing my SO and myself stress and anxiety with barking at all hours, spite bathrooms in the house, fighting with Penny, destroying/chewing everything. We have tried classes, calming aides, schedules, different sleeping arrangements, exercise, walks, medication with nothing working. My SO has a heart condition and needs a stress free (as stress free as possible). We both have busy jobs and can not take her out 10 times a day that she has to go out. Yesterday i had to break up a fight over a bone and then Maui was barking from 3:45 AM to 7:30 AM my SO and I decided to return her to the rescue. They understood the issues and will take her back. My family has said I am giving up to easy and have no patience for Maui. I feel horrible that I am returning her and I am being treated like an asshole, but am I an asshole?"
76,,AITA for not paying for my gym session today?,10,m1ytk9,61,"Earlier, I went to gym, and the first thing that greeted me was the blasting music. It was so loud that I pretty much feel the vibration on my skull. At first, I tried to ignore it but it really hurt my head. I have migraine and loud noise triggers it. So I told the owner (who was at the reception table that time) to turn lower the volume. He granted my request. However, the other gym users that time complained because they need something loud to pump themselves up.Since it hurts my head, I decided to pack up immediately (I haven't really started, just doing my warm up), and I told the owner that I'll come back on other day instead. However, he refused to let me go without paying. Even after I told him I haven't done anything, he refused to let me go.So I gave him an option: he lowers the volume, or I'll leave without paying since technically I should not really be paying anything. He chose the former. The other gym users disliked it, but after I explained that loud music triggers my migraine, they went silent.Two hours later, I called it a day. When I was paying, the gym owner said that due to ""disobedience and complains from the other customers"", he would be cancelling my membership, and I'm banned from using the facility for a year. I was like, ""What?"". I've been using the gym for like 4 months, and I never did anything disrespectful. I'm the guy who just mind his own business. But apparently, my refusal to pay ONCE is enough for him to cancel my membership.I'm still furious as of writing this. I refused to acknowledge that I'm the wrong here, but I need to make sure I'm not. AITA?EDIT: regarding the membership, this is how ot works in my country: members are like VIPs -- we can access locker and bathroom for free, and we only pay half of the rental fee. That's why I have to pay even if I'm also a member."
77,,AITA for running away to my BF's house before my grandma's funeral?,26,m1swgm,35,"My grandmother had passed away from old age. After returning home from the nursing home, she slept in peace. It was devastating for my father, who was in her presence as she was passing. I had planned in advanced to visit my boyfriend, who I had not seen in a year. My parents are against me seeing him. After turning 18, I has decided that I would go see him despite my parents' wishes. I had expressed my plans with my mom so she wouldn't feel as if I were doing things behind her back she said she disapproved, and tried to ""compromise"" with me: my older brother has to come with me to chaperone me, he can home to my house, or he and I hang out at my mom's work so she can supervise us. I would have agreed with the second option, but there's nothing to do at my house and my boyfriend is uncomfortable being around multiple people outside his family. I thoughg to myself, ""well I'm an adult now so I don't need to compromise with my mom"" and left to see him on Sunday. I did not let my parents know I was leaving because I had a feeling that they would physically stop me from going to see him. The drive is an hour long. 5 minutes away from his house, they called me screaming, demanding that I come back or else there will be consequences. They also threatened to call the police (which was so stupid, since the police can't do anything about this). The worst thing they could possibly do to me was destroy my thousand dollar PC, and they've threatened to break my possessions before, so I agreed to come back. My dad didn't trust that I was on my way so he demanded that I give him the address so he could come pick me up. On the ride back, he was lecturing me about how immature I was, that I should move out if I want to be an adult, and how much I've disrespected and dishonored my family, my grandparents, and my ancestors. He then said I should have at least waited to bury my grandmother before disrespecting him. I honestly have no remorse for my actions, and I resent my parents for getting in my way. I do feel like maybe it was disrespectful of me to go out while I should be mourning my grandma. AITA?"

My mom keeps on insisting that she wants to see me that day specifically because she's never missed one of my birthdays. I understand that it means alot to her and I told her we could hang out the Sunday before.  She ignored me and told me she was going to try and take off on my birthday so I can go over there in the morning.

79,,AITA For avoiding my friend with an ED,5,m23wks,12,"Just put NSFW Bc mention of ED. She used to be at a regular weight, but said she wanted to get healthier and started to count calories. This progressed over quarantine, with her obsession with food getting worse and worse. She would talk about her weight loss and her calorie limit every time we hung out, talked on the phone, or texted.  I think I was a little jealous at first. I had a hard time complimenting her on her new success, but every time she would bring up “what a whale” she used to be, it would remind me that her starting weight is my current weight. A couple more months went by and she lost a lot more weight in a shorter amount of time. When we would hang out she would skip meals and only eat frozen bags of vegetables or something small. One time she suggested we went out for dinner, and after she barely picked at her food she told me she had the urge to throw up from eating so much. I started to really worry that this was going to far, but when I brought it up she just laughed it off. The last conversation we had, she called me up to say hi and then complained how she wasn’t at her weight goal still, how girls from high school were so skinny even though they ate so much (we graduated high school three years ago), and that she couldn’t eat anymore today or she’d go over her calorie count. I told her that her behavior was toxic, that obsessing over weight like that was unhealthy. She laughed it off again and I ended the conversation early. Hanging out with her makes me feel super down, and I’ve been avoiding her since that phone call. I feel like any good friend would sit her down and seriously tell her they’re concerned, but I just get so angry when I try to help her and she laughs off my concern and I’d rather just give her time to figure herself out. She has a boyfriend and she still lives at home, so I know she’s not alone."
80,,AITA Commissioned a custom oil painting of my wife from a picture I liked she had taken at a studio,60,m1nzm1,96," Hi,This is my very first post on Reddit. I decided to take a picture I liked of my wife and have a 20"" x 24"" custom oil painting made for her. The artist suggested cropping the picture to accentuate her face which I accepted. I presented the completed painting to my wife who was very upset.TL, DR:She didn't like the following:* Cropping choices I made* The colors were not true to the original photograph.* The frame choice and color* The size of the painting* I should have had the jewelry color changed to match the clothing because she had worn the wrong color when the studio picture was taken.* ""Sucks in every way imaginable* Teeth and hair look creepy* Cost too much (About $300)* Smells like oil paint* Nowhere to hang itShe insists I am ""burdening her with things she doesn't like"". I have been yelled at when I don't get things for her for special occasions or meet her expectations. However, when I do get things for her she insists that I am a jerk for getting her something she doesn't want / like. It is possible that she is correct and I am an asshole for getting her a custom oil painting of herself.So, Reddit, am I the asshole?P.S. I have told her that we don't need to display, use or post the picture since she doesn't like it and I boxed back up it and took it away."
81,,AITA for not wanting my parents to move in with me on my first year of college?,53,m1on24,28,"Let's start up by saying that I know I wasn't the perfect daughter. I got in trouble in school for not agreeing with teachers, got grounded several times for making out with boys, and stuff like that. Nothing that is truly bad. This year is my graduating senior year, and you know what that means? College applications! Before my jr yr school just seemed pointless to me and my parents could tell. I was in an LDS school before junior year and I absolutely hated it so I didn't put any effort at all. This was until junior year that I applied to an Arts School and got it. I have to admit I had a rocky start adjusting but I got a handle of it later and now I'm even graduating with honors! This senior year I remember applying to what I believed were my best options by major and curriculum However, my parents and family members were insistent that I applied to universities with a 100% of acceptance because they did not believe I was going to be able to get in. I honestly took offence on that and decided to not apply to any of the schools they recommended and was very honest about. I believed that even with a not so great school record I could get into any school if I worked hard enough in my essay and SATs. I ended up getting into all of the schools I applied to! My parents were not so happy about it since they said the schools were very far and that I should conform with local. I said no and insisted that I wanted to study in a school that I liked since I knew it would keep me motivated. So they said that if I moved away far my mom would have to live with me. I was livid about this. They didn't do this with any of my siblings Not my brother because he was a guy, not my sister who spent a year in Brazil after her senior year. So why should it be different with me? Also I haven't lived in my parents' house for the last two years, jumping from house to house and now they want to live with me? I mentioned this and they said that I wasn't mature enough to be by myself. They say that when I had to go through struggles by myself because they would judge me or ground me if I told them something that was going on in my life. They say this when they weren't there emotionally for me for the last couple years. They say this when I have a part time job that is killing me because I don't want them to spend money on me. So I told them that I would prefer continuing with a part time job and get student aid rather than having to live under their household again. They took this me being ungrateful and saying that I just want to party without them knowing, or sleep around. I don't have the best relationship with my parents, I know. Am I being unreasonable for preferring to pay for my education rather than having them around me trying to check on everything I do while paying my education? Am I being the asshole for preferring to live by my own rather than what I believe is toxic parenting?"
82,,AITA for how I quit my job?,7,m20ckl,12,"Background information, about 2 years ago when I was 20 I started working at a company in their shipping department. There were 4 people in the dept, Kevin our supervisor, then Ryan, Jason, and myself. For some reason, which I really think it boils down to insecurity, Kevin hated Jason. After about 8 months of working there, Kevin switched our positions while Jason was on vacation. Lot of drama there but that led to Jason quitting last summer in 2020. So now we were down to 3. On top of all this, Kevin had been training me to do everything, his job included so I could hold down the fort when he was out. All this responsibility and knowledge was going to get me a bigger raise according to Kevin, and he would personally talk to the owner for my raise. I'll spare the boring details but after I'd be there 1.5 years it was time for me to get this raise, and the amount I got was drastically lower than the conversations Kevin and I had about it, and come to find out Kevin never talked to the owner. I let it go for another 6 months frankly because I had a lot going on, but Ryan ended up quitting at the end of the year, so now we're down to 2 people, I've got responsibility and duties out the ass, and the pay was just not worth it. The environment was terrible and I had to get out. Okay, longer than I wanted, but now we get the aita part. But first a couple side notes. -Kevin had told me from the get go that he'd understand if I found a better opportunity, just to let him know on my last day.-Kevin was an incredibly toxic person, something I realized too late, as by this point I'd been friends with him and hung out outside of work (I've learned my lesson here).-Kevin was my supervisor, but he didn't have any real authority regarding my employment, though I believed he did because he said he did and no one had explained to me otherwise, though by now I had realized how full of shit he was. I really didn't wanna leave on bad terms, so after I got the offer for my new job, I did the only thing I could think. I went to HR and the operations manager (Kevin's boss) and told them I was leaving. They were both understanding, and even told my I didn't have to tell Kevin, and they'd tell him for me after I was gone, because even they knew how he could be. I told them I would tell Kevin on my last day  as I really didn't want to leave anyone on bad terms. Well my last day came and someone let it slip to Kevin that I was leaving. He questioned me about it and I told him that yea it was my last day but I was gonna tell him, I wasn't just going to leave. He disappears for 20 min, and comes back and tells me to get out. He's screaming at me and I just got my stuff, left, and called HR and let her know what happened. This thing has been bothering me since, because the outcome was what I wanted to avoid, but I'm not sure how else I could've handled it. Maybe I should've just told Kevin and left. So, aita?"
83,,"AITA for being sarcastic towards an employee from an online music store, after he was (in my opinion) rude and unprofessional?",8,m1wg5x,38,"As backstory, i will say that i am a drummer, and i use electronic drums for the purpose of being quiet and not disturbing my neighbors while playing.Today i was in this site, and there is always a chat window with employees for every different type of music instrument or parts like guitar picks, amps, drums and percussion (acoustic and electronic drums are seperate, also there is a seperate space for percussion instruments, drum heads, drum pads, different types of drums and so on) so i enter ""electronic drums"" and the chat window appeared.I opened the chat and said to the employee ""Hello! I wanted to ask how is it possible to record my drums?"" (there is such an option on electronic drumsets, basically to record from the ""drum module"", which is responsible for delivering the sounds to the amp/headphones, and to transfer it to a laptop or a PC.).The person replied only with ""i guess you threw the manual away"", and i think this response is kinda rude, because yes, he may not know how to do it exactly for my drumset (although the company which made it is owned by the company who made the site), but he could have told me something along the lines of ""i am sorry, i don't know, you can try and search the manual for the module, to see where you can find the options and how to do that."" and that would have been totally fine.After his reply i responded with ""Thanks for your kind response, good sir! Have a nice day! ""After that i started searching for terms of service of the site, to see is his response reportable, and also is there a rule saying that before asking a question i need to have made my own research (which would be an understandable rule in my opinion) and i tried to open another chat window, and the same person was there (their names are shown on the top of the window).I pretended to be another person, asking for terms of service and a link to them if there are such, and he responded, but i had to wait 10 minutes. Then i responded to him after 6 minutes, and i told him, that i will definetly read them ""So i wouldn't be like some annoying clients who i assume have threw away the manual"" ( this was a quote from what i texted him).Am i the asshole here?I think i may have been the AH, because after all they may have a lot of clients asking different questions about different things, and my question may have been stupid.Edit for info: I made a research on how to record my drums before asking the employee. In the manual i didn't find a response, and in the review of the set it was not shown. I think they recorded with an amp and a camera, because i didn't see any outputs that look like they are for recording (line out and midi USB) ."
84,,AITA for possibly talking differently to a coworker?,17,m1u4qw,15,"I (25 m) work an overnight shift at a grocery store. I've been at the store for a few years, so I try to help new workers when I can. Sometime last year we hired an elderly gentleman (60 m) to help stock our shelves.For my AITA, you should know I am a caucasian male, and the new hire is an African-American who is hard of hearing. Our store doesn't like talking to employees one on one and prefers collective statements. If one person falls behind, it's the entire group's fault the job isn't complete. My coworker is not the fastest worker so I try to help him speed things up. Arrived at an early shift today where the store was open. My coworker was already on the clock doing another task, so I started my own elsewhere. After helping some customers, I noticed he left a stepping stool at the opposite end of an aisle that he was working at. It's a safety hazard to leave it out unattended. I brought it over to him saying, ""Hey, these need to be off the floor if they aren't in use."" He probably didn't see or hear me arrive, so I may have startled him. He gave a sigh and just sent me away. Not long after, he found me in another aisle. He states I was disrespecting him the way I talked to elderly people. He also states I talk to him differently than the other workers. He then asks that we don't speak to each other again. This was all in the aisle in front of customers. I was confused why he would think I speak to him differently. I try to treat everyone the same unless I've known them for a while. I believe he thought I was being racist, as he was the only non-caucasian in the department. I would never do anything racist for any reason. If I did talk to him differently, it would be that all our conversations were him asking for help, and me assisting. I figured no one told him the stools needed to be picked up. About closing time he starts to leave early, stating he skipped break. This is against store policy and I stated as such. Unfortunately, this started an argument about the above topics. I'm going to talk to a manager in the morning, but I would like to know if I screwed up."
85,,AITA for not accepting a customer's request to respect the policy of one of our vendors?,4,m22isk,11,"Bit of background, I work at a market where the owner is in a different country so I'm in charge of dealing with almost everything related to the people who come in. We often have some vendors that rent a small space to sell their own items and make the full profit off of them. We have a lady who makes pastries and there is this guy who would always come in whenever she was working and buy everything he could from her. He was a good costumer for her. However, last week he called me to say that she told him that he could take whatever didn't sell after the day was over. I asked her about it and she said she didn't say that. Now, i understand it may have been a miscommunication since he's often a bit high when he comes in (I'm not assuming, he has told us lol) so he may have misunderstood, but she told me she would talk to him about it. Later he called to ask me to hold the leftover bread for him until next week, and she told me to sell it and tell him that her policy was that she could only hold items for 2 hours upon customer request. So skip to today, he asks me if he should pay me or her for the bread and when I ask, he says he hasn't spoken to her or received any message from her. I tell him about the policy and he gets upset and asks to speak to the supervisor (that would be me) he asks why I couldn't hold the items for longer if I am the supervisor, and I just say that because they're not my items but the vendor's, i have to respect what she decides to do with them, which was to not hold it. He pulls the ""I've been a loyal customer for x time, without me there's no (market name) I'm gonna write a letter to the owner"" and I tell him to feel free to do so, and that I'm sorry but I don't make the policies. I thought he was just a nut job until I talked to another person and he said ""if you know the customer and they're coming often, you should just hold the items for however long they want."" And i realized how simple it would have been but I thought he was thinking he could just take it and go.So, while I could have saved the item , I decided to sell it because it's what she told me to do and in turn I lost a recurring customer. AITA?EDIT: for the bot that says ""this is why OP thinks they're the asshole"" add to that: I may have misunderstood him and misjudged his intentions because I thought he was trying to lie and say he could take whatever didn't sell that day for free, and I only talked to the vendor instead of trying to clear things up with him first"
86,,WIBTA if I reported my neighbors for not taking in their trash can?,22,m1t2mp,27,"I'm in the US. Our city has an ordinance that trash cans can't be on the curb for more than 24 hours surrounding trash time. I swear I don't typically care about these things, so I'll explain.I live in a cul-de-sac. My neighborhood has horrific drainage issues, and we've already dealt with that twice this year (we flooded after the snow and ice melted, as well as after 3 days of rain recently). Generally this isn't much of an issue as we all know how to adequately deal with it, and it does lead to very lush and beautiful land during the summer.However, last year one of the houses in my cul-de-sac was bought and subsequently rented to two couples. They have a huge issue with leaving their trash can on the road, and leaving the lid open for easy access. They moved in during fall, so during colder weather, and I've mentioned it a couple times and they've always brought it back in when I said something. But after a couple weeks it comes back and stays again.My biggest issue is spring is starting, and our neighborhood already has a HUGE issue with mosquitos. An open trash can is literally the perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes. My daughter and I are both mildly allergic to mosquito bites, plus West Nile was found in mosquitos in our neighborhood last year. I've tried talking to them, and it hasn't worked. WIBTA if I reported them to the authorities on this? I don't want to be an intolerable neighbor, but I feel this is an easy concession to make for the greater good of the neighborhood.EDIT: alright, I understand that while I might not exactly be the asshole, reporting probably won't solve anything. I'll try talking to them one more time and if that doesn't work I'll just do my best to take extra precautions. Thanks everyone, I've read all the replies and taken them to heart."
87,,AITA I M23 bought a motorcycle and my mother is freaking out saying she's going to destroy it,21,m1sr86,52," Basically the title is the tldr. So this last year has been extremely rough on me to say the least, I lost my job due to covid, then had some legal trouble, so now I'm back living with my parents while I look for work, but I still make some money by doing some freelance mechanic and programming work (important later). Yesterday I finally decided that I could realize my 13 year old wet dream and pull the trigger on a $500 Kawasaki Concours, the detuned touring version of my dream bike, and when I brought it home my mother blew up at me screaming about how I don't care about my life and how this was such a poor financial decision and how she's going to put sugar in the gas tank to make sure that I can't ride it. When I went to buy the bike I had no intension of actually buying it, but when I got on the back for the test ride I genuinely smiled for the first time in over a year, and not to mention if I were to trade it in the dealership in my town would give me 2200 no questions asked, and I also have a full time job lined up making more than double what I used to, and was planning on moving out a month after my start date. Sorry for the long read but I just need some advice, am I the asshole for putting my happiness over my mother's?"
88,,AITA for expressing my annoyance (via F-bomb) at my husband's question while I was doing yoga?,31,m1q7h1,63,"Background: I (36f) have a 15 month old. I am trying to get off the weight I gained after losing our first pregnancy at 5 months. With the pandemic, it's been harder: I was a powerlifter, and I LOVE the gym. We've had some pretty stressful things happen since then, and since pregnancy #2, but we're starting to get into the swing of things... which leads me to my question.I'm trying to sleep better at night, now that our kiddo is sleeping though the night (hurrah!). I'm trying to get in cardio during the early part of the day, so that once kiddo goes to bed at 7pm, I can do yoga and stretching to basically fix the muscles I'm using and abusing. It also is helping me to decompress and just be better.Husband (42m) and I had a spat earlier in the evening, but I thought we had agreed to talk about the topic later. Until hubs asked during the end of my yoga if I was done with the tea kettle. During the fun part where you're just trying to chill out after doing the hard work. I got annoyed, but waited 30s or so to respond, and said, ""No, I'm not done, and if you could not interrupt me during yoga, I'd appreciate it."" (I have asked him not to bother me during yoga before, but it's hard because the only room in our place big enough to stretch in is the living room.)He got defensive, started replying, but then I noticed that he had turned off the kettle anyway. I purposely had turned it on so that I could have a cup of tea at the end of the session (it was a short one: 15 minutes or so, so it wasn't in the ""keep warm"" stage too long-- we're in the US so it takes a bit to boil). At this point, I was so frustrated that I interrupted him and asked him to turn the kettle on. He was miffed, and told me I was being inappropriate. Here's where I think I was the asshole, but I'm not sure because sometimes when I think I'm being an ass, I'm setting a healthy boundary... so I'm honestly not sure here. I told him he had no right to be annoyed at the interruption after interrupting my yoga. That it was a fucking double standard, and the least he could have done was to turn the kettle back on.He got mad and went into his office and locked the door. So, AITA?"
89,,Aita for not wanting brother-in-law's family in my next family trip?,4,m24c1u,15,"I (37f) have a sister in law named Janice(26f) from my husband's side of the family. Technically, i'm not really sure if she could even be considered a sister in law because she never married my brother-in-law Adam (28m) (they were engaged but he had a mental break a few months before their marriage and called things off).My husband (40m) is very fond of her, he sees her as part of the family, think of a little sister, and always held hope she and my brother-in-law would get back together. I think she's a nice girl, a bit childish and awkward but has a good head in her shouldersEvery year me, my husband and our son (10m) take a holiday trip to a very nice resort, it's a great place to unwind and it's very family friendly. Back in 2017 my Sil was having financial issues and my husband offered her to come with us for free, she refused saying she did not want to burden our trip and that she had to stay to take care of her son (6m). My husband said she could take the kid (which i have no issues with, he's a quiet and calm kid who i've never seen throw a tantrum) and after seeing that she still refused i said that if she was so worried about being a burden she could come to the trip and watch the kids which only then she agreed.So, she started accompanying us on our family trips and spending the time there with the kids until 2019.In 2019 after some time in therapy my brother-in-law wanted to reconcile with her and be there for his son and obviously my husband and I whole heartedly supported him, so much we invited him on the trip (Janice was ok with him being invited, she just really wanted to her son to have a closer relationship with his dad).During the entire trip Adam didn't stop following Janice around and while he did spend a good amount of time with his son me and my husband still had to watch the kids a lot during the trip. The kids were more interested in splashing around in the water than listening to adult's talk so we spent a lot of time by the pool making sure no one drowned or walked of with some stranger and in all honesty that was tiring.Obviously we had no trip in 2020 but me and my husband were planning our trip to this year after getting vaccinated if the situation gets better and i mentioned that i didn't want to bring anyone other than our son on the trip and he said that it was no problem but asked why i decided that and i mentioned 2019's trip and how we had to spend all the time taking care of the kids so much we really couldn't relax.He got defensive and said something along the lines of ""We were doing my brother a favor besides we really didn't do anything other than just watching the kids"" but didn't argue any further.That whole conversation has been replaying in my mind for a while and i really want to know if i'm in the wrong here because the more it replays the more i feel like i am"

91,,AITA For Nagging My SIL?,4,m240hq,11,"My SIL, Brother, and their now 10 month old baby moved into my and my mothers house. Currently I'm going to college while working at the same time and my mother works full time 80 hours a week. My SIL (S for short) has a nasty habit of not cleaning up after herself and while my brother (B) tries his best not only does he sleep most of the day as he works night shift, but he's not so good at keeping up with house work. S does not work at all, she strong armed B into letting her be a stay at home mom and claimed that she would go back to work when the baby was eight months old. Now I work part time and do school online, so I understand my niece is going to be a bit loud as she is young, and that I'll have to deal with living noises. The issue is that S sits around all day long, always on the couch and only getting up to cook and leave things out. The house has started to stink and with B needing to sleep, my mother and I have had to pick up most of the cleaning. S will leave formula caked to the counters, dirty pans on the stove for days, she fills up the laundry room with their washing to the point I can't tell what is clean or dirty. I have to nag her constantly just so I can wash my clothes. The sink stays piled up with dishes and food, often tossed down the wrong side. The other day she dropped the salt into gravy and let it stay caked on the shaker for 3 days. I used to pick up after them but I can't anymore. So now the living room is filled with toys, food their child has thrown, soiled clothes and towels, the worst part is they've caked formula into the fabric couches. I've started spree cleaning every now and then just for sanity, when I do I'll remind S and B that the counters need to be wiped down, that S can't leave food on the stove they've already attracted ants. Things like that, ill admit I haven't been the nicest but it has been six months of this. S recently told my mother that she was about to snap back at me and honestly, I welcome it. I've tried really hard to not complain but everything I've told you is just the tip of the iceberg. Am I the asshole here?"

I understand where she was coming from and I always told her when I heard rumors or I found out if her boyfriend was starting trouble. Well in the last 3 months she kept going on about how her friend group kept disappointing her and every time I always asked if there was something that I could do to fix it and she just kept telling me no. Ok no hard feeling she’s been going threw some stuff, nothing major but I know it’s getting on her nerves. But it’s switched to me and another girl I hang out with. I am always there for whatever Abby needs and I’m just treated as a second option when she feels like it. Most of the time she’s super cranky and just ignores me but when she actually wants to hang out and she decides that I’m worth it we have so much fun. She started 2 weeks ago about how I’m disappointing her and how she can’t trust anybody. I just ignored her because I just didn’t care by that point. Well today she messaged the group chat that we’re all part of saying how she was sick of everyone and how she just wants to go separate ways because nobody wants to communicate with her. This is where I’m probably TA. I BLEW up at her. I told her that everyone is sick of her bullshit and that it’s hilarious that she’s upset that nobody will communicate when she hasn’t don’t it in 3 fucking years. How nobody wants to hear her continually say that everyone is disappointing her but she won’t say what the fuck if wrong with her this time. And also I was happy that we where going our different ways so I wouldn’t have to deal with her shit any longer. I know that advice isn’t really a thing here but it’s welcome if you would like to bless me with ideas on how to fix this because I feel bad but I just couldn’t do it anymore"
93,,WIBTA if I don't want to live with a non-student,15,m1tuw9,44," Hey people,Thanks in advance for reading and any insight. So I 21M, live with 5 people, in a student house in the UK, and we're all close. About a month ago, housemate B (20F) moved out and back to her home country of Ecuador since she preferred to go back home and be with her family and friends back home, and it's cheaper for her to live with her parents.This is where the issue occurs. So despite moving out she is still locked into a 12 month contract which ends in September. She has been having temporary tenants staying for like a week (sub-letting on her contract), and the last one we had, we had no say or info that this dude was moving in - but she apologised for that and hopefully that won't happen again.As per the tenancy agreement, the only contractual option she has is to handover the contract to a new person for the remainder of her contract, and they have to be a student at one of the local universities which has been specified by the landlord. So in short she is violating the tenancy agreement, but it hasn't been an issue for me until now.She has proposed a random 30M non-student, as a new tenant for Apr-Aug ( which is when finals are and the final celebrations will be taking place), I hate living with people I don't know and I'm scared about the potential to be uncomfortable by the presence of this new guy, and think it's a reasonable expectation for me to want to live with only students of my age, since that's what I signed up for.Would I be an asshole, if I say to her No this new tenant is not acceptable to me, and I'm only going to agree to new tenants whom are students?Finding a Student tenant at this time of year is difficult and even harder because of covid, and she will struggle to find a replacement tenant, but I don't think it's my duty to compromise for a situation which she created by moving out. I don't want to be a dick and just tell the Landlord what she's doing, but I also am scared of the potential negative social effects for me, by living with someone whom I'm not close with.Thanks in advance for any replies :)So yeah WIBTA if I say no to living with a non-student and stranger?"

Last year single parents were able to form an extended home with 1 other adult. On our group chat I said “whoop!” its tough single parenting in a pandemic. B private msg me to say I shouldn’t see bf because I still had symptoms from covid. I told her my doc told me I’m not infectious. B says in her covid journey she’s been spking with experts and no one knows if I am. I say we’ve both seen our docs and are taking their advice. She’s angry, swears at me, tells me I’m gaslighting her, saying her info isn’t valid, and trying to silence her. Shocked I block her. I leave our gc saying I’m finding things difficult and need a break.Days later I get an email from B. She says sorry for swearing, then tells me she has to take a break from our friendship and doesn’t know if we can be friends. She’s upset I blocked her without telling her, it was all done out of care, if I’d reacted differently, she would have been able to cope better. She also says she is sorry to do this “to a friend, but especially a friend with a chronic illness,” and man I hate it when people reduce me to my ci diagnosis.I put her on blast, telling her it wasn’t about care, it was disrespectful, disagreeing is not gaslighting, everything she did escalated things, I would get in touch when I was ready and not the other way around. She had gone on in her email about how much she loved me and my daughter, and so I told her that someone who behaves that way is not someone I want around my kid.After several months of thought I ended the friendship. I told her accusing me of emotional abuse was too serious to ignore. She emails to say she has told me before not to contact her, she does not tolerate abuse, and if I contact her again she will report me to police.Then C get’s involved. I had enjoyed her company in a group but she was overbearing and needy at times. When I sent her a msg after the conflict with B asking how she was she took days to reply when before it would have been minutes. B has shown her our emails. C says my comments about my daughter were cruel and a slap in the face, and I should have thought more about everything B had done for me, she is dissapointed at my decision.Because she’s been a boundary violator before I explain she’s often ignored my boundaries and given that she took sides without hearing my side of the story and was arrogantly presuming to tell me what I had or had not thought about I didn’t want to hear from her again.I miss my friends, and the good times. This has caused pain and sadness for A, and I feel bad because B had bad long covid, maybe my comment about my daughter did go too far? Losing friends hurts and I feel ashamed. So AMITA?Edit:  As ppl don't appear to be digesting fully.B didn't tell me not to talk to her until after I ended the friendship.I let B know I was leaving the chat on the group chat. I didn't think it was the kind of thing to tell someone twice as that is rubbing their face in it.B and C are both the kind of ppl who demand closure and full discussion of every issue so I knew if I didn't give it to them it would string things out for everyone for a long time."
95,,WIBTA for having a really frank discussion with my brother about why his actions are unacceptable?,24,m1rgn7,13,"On mobile sorrySo my brother (19M) and I (20F) have always had a very strained relationship growing up. Well when he was 16 he had a mental incident and ended up in a hospital for like 2-3 weeks. A lot of that is shrouded in mystery on my parent’s end, saying to me“can’t you clearly see something is wrong with him mentally” when something happens. From what little information I have, I think it may be schizophrenia or something similar.I bring up any issues I have with him to my parents rather than my brother because he gets hostile if I try to tell him he’s wrong in any way, and it’s usually easier for my parents. On to the issue at hand, I’ve been sick in bed for the last 4-5 days due to a complication from a surgery. So this morning, around 11am, as he was getting ready to go out he was using the bathroom that connects to my room and the hallway to freshen up in the mirror before heading out (this is not unusual but he showers in another bathroom). And all of a sudden I hear a spray bottle go off, and I turn to look in that direction because I know the only spray bottle in that bathroom is my heat protecting spray that I spent about 20 dollars on. The door is open and I see him using that spray and I was like hey that’s mine, why are you using it, and he responded with well it’s in the bathroom not your room therefore anyone is allowed to use it. I told him no that’s my item and you don’t even have a need for it you’re not about to curl your hair or anything, and he’s like well if you didn’t just lay around in bed all day you wouldn’t have even known I used it.After he left I went to the bathroom to check to see how much he used and noticed that my razor was no longer where I usually keep it (behind the vanity mirror which he doesn’t keep anything in) I talked to my sis, she said she didn’t touch it. So I went to my parents about it and they said they’d address it with him which turned into lightly suggesting to him that he doesn’t use other peoples stuff and then telling me, “We’ve tried talking to him but you know how he is, don’t leave your stuff in places he can access them” Here’s where I lost it, so after all this I got a new razor and put it in the shower (which he doesn’t use). When I go in there to brush my teeth before bed, there my razor is sitting on the countertop with these like longer darker hairs that could have only come from one place on a guy. Not only that but recently I started having some problems down there w/o having any recent partners, which makes me very scared he’s been doing this for a lot longer than I have been aware and he may have caused my issues.WIBTA if I had a pretty frank conversation about how this behavior is not okay, for general reasons&hygienic reasons, because it seems the conversations my parents had earlier didn’t work as he used my razor again after that to shave down there?"
96,,WIBTA if I asked for a starter spot on my acedemic decathlon team which would bump my friend down to an alternate?,4,m23j9m,13,"Edit: So after all the comments I decided not to try for the starter spot.  Also, some of you guys made it out to me wanting specifically her spot which is not true. It more or less goes like this:  (point are not the actually points we got)bob-6000 Dave-5000 my friend-4000 me-actually 3500 if I half-assed the interview and speech-4500.  It's not about it being her spot it just happens that it would be her spot.I am typing this on my phone so the formatting might be weird. If I need to explain more about academic decathlon for you to understand the situation tell me in the commentsSo I am a freshman and my friend is also a freshman. We joined the academic decathlon and during regionals, she ended up getting more points than me. This means that I would have to be an alternate and she would be a starter. I was fine with this because she did get more points than me and it was my fault I did poorly on my speech and interview.  The thing about being an alternate is that you don't need to do a speech or interview but your points don't count in the overall team score. At the state competition, she did technically get more points than me.  When we went back to school that is what she told everybody. The thing is once again I don't have points from an interview or a speech. But I was still very close to her score.  If I was to do a speech and interview I wouldn't even have to try to beat her.  This is why I would like to ask our coach to become a starter during the national competition.  I would get more points for the team and I would also like to try to do a speech and interview.  So WIBTA if I asked for that which would make my friend an alternate?  She is also very competitive and I think would be very mad if I did."
97,,AITA for spending money on “deceit”?,4,m23btw,13,"So, backstory, I moved in with my parents last year during quarantine and am currently living rent free. I’ve been paying for my eyelash extensions for over a year now and my mom has never approved. She thinks they are superficial. I recently bought hair extensions because my hair is thin and after a bad perm 8 months ago I had to cut it to my shoulders and it is HASHED. Now, I will say, I buy a lot of stuff. It’s kind of a problem but I pay my bills on time and I work hard while going to school so I don’t see why it’s a problem to anyone but me. Anyway, I bought a Harvard sweatshirt, even though I don’t go to Harvard, because I thought it would be funny and it was meant to be a pajama shirt. About 15 minutes ago I ran to my mom saying she would never believe the great news, you know, cuz I think I’m funny. Anyway, she sighed and said I keep putting so much money into deceit like hair extensions, lash extensions and now the Harvard sweater amongst a few other things. I got defensive and upset because what the hell? It was a joke and if someone were to ever ask I’d say I didn’t go to Harvard? Anyway, she said this was all a symptom of a larger problem, “my insecurity”. I don’t know I feel angry because am I selling myself as deceitful? If someone asked I’d say my hair was extensions and it’s no secret my lashes are fake. So am I the asshole for being upset?EDIT***I work part time and go to school part time so I’m not just being lazy around the house. I also clean the house and have my own set of chores that I do. I also, buy my own food, water, toilet paper so I’m not a burden to them. My parents have never asked for rent and actually asked me to move in during quarantine because they were worried. Every time I mention moving out they say they would miss me but if I’m ready to move on they are happy for me."
98,,"AITA for yelling at my roommate for calling me a ""paper-handed b__ch?""",3,m22935,10,"So, to start me and my roommate are both computer science majors, and coincidentally both big fans of retail investing. A few months ago, he introduced me to GME and told me how much money he was making in just a few short weeks by holding onto the stock. I knew the stock was super inflated at the time, and warned him to sell and take his money before it dropped but he didn't listen to me. Well, a week later and he's sobbing to me how he lost all his money and wished he had sold.Fast forward a few weeks and I decided to buy into GME as it was moving up and the momentum on the stock looked favorable. I bought in around $130. Well, my roommate, who also still owned GME, came up to me all excited saying how GME was going back up and he is in the money again and can't wait for GME to moon to $1000 and more. I said it's good that you're back in the money, but maybe this time you should consider taking your money off the table. He asked me what stock I was currently in and I told him I invested a little into GME as a purely speculative play and was not planning on holding that long. He then said ""don't be a paper handed b__ch, hold onto it!""I don't know why but that statement really upset me. I started yelling at him saying how his behavior and attitude towards the stock was the reason he almost lost all his money on it in the first place, and hadn't he learned his lesson from the first time?Now he won't talk to me anymore, anytime I try to bring anything up he just says the paper handed thing over and over.So, AITA for beating a dead horse and reminding him of the dangers of investing? Or should I have just not said anything about him losing money on GME the first time?"
99,,AITA for not lying to my friend?,3,m21s9f,4,"English is not my first language and also I'm on mobile if the formatting is weird.My fiancé (31, M) and I (25, F) are currently stuck abroad because we have two different nationalities and can't go to either of our home countries due to the travel restrictions. We met another couple with the same nationalities (They're in their 30s) and became friends when we were stuck on a remote island together. We all applied for a visa to a different country together as we had to leave when our previous visa was running out. Our friends got theirs first and then the agency announced they're not giving out any more visas, the country's cases spiked, they shut down and the two of us got stuck on our own. Now they're open again and we applied again, our friends are waiting for us and keep sending us pictures and videos. But my fiancé and I are kind of tight with money and we paid for our extension here, so we decided to wait until our visa runs out before we leave. Also, trying to avoid unnecessary trips, as we hope each day that one of our countries will open and we can instead go home. Our friend keeps offering to pay for the express visa instead so we can get there sooner and we keep saying we already borrowed money from our boss (remote work) which is true and don't want any more loans. And we're also waiting on documents to arrive in the mail so we can get married, go home and stop with the unnecessary travelling around. So, we wanna wait for our next paycheck to pay for the visa and then another few weeks to leave. I told my friend that when she again offered to pay. Now she's pissed saying we're just making the same mistake over and over again (last time we applied just a day or two after them and were just unlucky, we could have only followed them by paying for the incredibly expensive VIP visa service) and we should stop deluding ourselves about our countries opening any time soon. I complained to my fiancé about her being rude and pushy and he told me it was my fault for not lying to her or keeping information from her when she asked. But every time I give her a reason she finds a way around it, so eventually I felt like the only thing I could say is that we simply decided to wait until our visa extension runs out. Am I the asshole here? My social skills are pretty low due to always being the outcast and only having a small group of introvert friends while my fiancé is a popular, social butterfly and quite good at using his social skills to his advantage."
100,,AITA for charging my roomate $200 for having to clean their bathroom,48,m1m6lw,89," I asked them to clean it several times in the week before this because it was completely unusable, and when I decided I was gonna have 1 friend over for a safe gathering I told them they needed to urgently clean it and gave them a deadline. This was the day before and I know for a fact they were up for hours after I told them and they woke up and left with only enough time to go to work on the day of. So I was forced to clean it.The money is because last time I had to do this I charged $100 (mostly for cleaning supplies) and told them it would go up by 100 every time I had to clean it for them.Most of that is because of the state of the bathroom, now I don't expect showroom quality cleaning, thats just ridiculous, but it was revolting. The fake wood floor is warped and permanently stained by urine with urine all the way around the toilet to the wall and up the toilet in a thick coating that I had to scrub at. The plunger they stole from me (even though I told them to get their own) as well as a white scale and toilet brush that were placed next to the toilet are all yellow and coated in piss. There was a piece of toilet paper just sitting on the floor coated in poop. The caulking on the bottom of the toilet is completely rotted and moldy. There was no toilet paper. And there was poop all over the back of the seat and even after scrubbing with bleach its permanently stained brown. The smell was gag-worthy too. I didn't even look at the tub cause I'm sure its just terrible so I just closed the shower after throwing the bath mat (that given the state of the floor I just assumed was soaked in pee) in there. I cleaned everything with bleach and scrubbed it but the floor and seat are still stained and I wasnt willing to get close enough to the toilet to get the piss off the floor on the sides and wall but I got it off the front of the toilet and the seat/rim and where you would stand. The sink got a scrub down but besides dust it was clean...I feel justified but idk. They're obviously very mad about me charging them (I haven't gotten the money, im assuming they'll pay when they get their paycheck). But they're in their late 20's and all they do is retail work and gaming so I really don't see why they let it get this way let alone ignore me when I tell them to clean it! My own isn't always the cleanest but I clean it a couple times a week and I don't get poop and piss all over it in the first place!Edit: they couldn't use my bathroom because my night-shift partner was asleep in thereEdit 2.0: I guess it wasn't clear but for a week before this I was telling them to clean it and they had several days off work in that time and could've cleaned it.Edit: I call it their bathroom for brevity but it is a bathroom in the hallway, not the roomates roomEdit 3.0: to clear it up, yes we should move out but we can't afford it and my partner won't kick them out since they're related. Yes this is problematic but I can't really do anything about that. Advice welcome as long as its not just ""break up"" or ""move out""Last edit: all of your comments helped me get the courage to sit them both down and talk and they now have a joint cleaning schedule and the roomate has a ""go to therapy or get kicked out"" rule that they agreed too. Hopefully it sticks"
101,,AITA for not doing “my chores”,3,m2531j,13,"My parents have been separated for about a year, and about four months ago I moved in with my dad simply because I don’t like my mom or brother for a lot of reasons. My brother and I also don’t have a close relationship because of some things he did to me. I also recently turned 18 and I’ve been trying to become more independent from my mother who tried to smother me. Before I moved out I had a chinchilla that is still at my mom’s house.I will often visit my mom’s house, usually before she comes back from work, and I will just clean up here and there, and take care of my chinchilla. I don’t mind helping her around the house (even though my brother lives with her). I vacuum, I wash the dishes, do the laundry, on occasion. However, I don’t go over when my mother is there due to the fact that she bosses me around and whenever I’m over while she is there all she asks me is to do things. Sometimes I will visit just to say hi and then she asks me to do the dishes, and it looks like the dishes haven’t been done since I last visited. Same thing with the vacuuming.One day I had gone over to visit with my boyfriend, and she asked me to vacuum, I tried to but I had been feeling really sick for the last couple days and I couldn’t, and ended up going back to my dad’s instead. I told her I was feeling sick and that I had asked my brother to vacuum instead. Two days later she texts me asking me if I’m feeling better, I say yes, I thought she was asking because she cared about my well being but no, she was asking to see when I could come over to start vacuuming. Once she even had the audacity to get mad at me and sent me and angry text saying “please come over here and do your chores right now”. On top of it all she wants me to order, get food for my brother. My brother will text her that he’s hungry and then she’ll ask me to get it for him, not order delivery, to buy the food and drop it off at the house for him (her house is about a 15 minute drive). Sometimes she’ll send me the money but sometimes she won’t and I have to use money from my paycheck to buy it for him. Once she asked me to order some food for my brother because he said he was hungry, so I did. Later on I went over and I asked her for $10 to order some food, she got upset with me and said I should eat the food at the house (even though because she doesn’t usually cook dinner there is no food). The most insane part, the only reason why I don’t have the $10 to order food is because I had to spend about $30 the previous day to buy my brother some food.I don’t understand why she is getting mad that I’m not helping to clean a house I don’t even live in. Whenever I visit (usually 2-3 times a week) I clean up after myself to make sure there is no extra mess. I spend my own money to buy HER son food. And I never get a thank you for any of it, because I’m “supposed” to do it. It’s gone so far as to me avoiding coming over if I know she’s there because I know she’s just going to ask me to do more things.AITA?"
102,,AITA for finally pushing my best friend away?,3,m24wnh,4,"This just happened recently and I'm still kinda emotional, but I'll try my best to keep this impartial.To bear in mind, I have been battling anxiety and depression for around 6 years. I have always been a very private person about this, for better or worse, but I rarely ever tell anyone when I'm struggling, even if it's very obvious. I have a best friend who I'll call Josie (not her real name). We have been friends since around the time I started having these mental health problems (not related to me becoming friends with her lol) and we are incredibly close. Or, at least I thought we were. Recently, I have been eating differently compared to normal and exercising more, noticeably losing weight. This is due to my mental health seriously decreasing. I am not in an unhealthy weight range, however. Josie has been mentioning this to me for a while now. This is not in a caring way - or at least, to me it doesn't sound like it - but in a way that is very critical and sounds like she is almost condemning me for having these issues. But because I do not believe I'm being unhealthy, I always assure her that I have it under control. It is the same conversation every time. Josie mentions it and she gets angry at me and ignores me when I don't want to talk about it or try to assure her I am not unhealthy. Josie also hasn't been in a great place mentally recently either, but I'm always there for her and most of our conversations now revolve around her mental health even when I feel like I cannot shoulder any more issues. I don't tell her this, so I don't blame her for any of it.Today, Josie had been ignoring me all day. I asked if she was angry and me and she said she was, finally telling me that she was sick of trying to give me advice (sidenote: I don't remember her giving me advice, she was always just very critical of me for having these issues as if I could control them. But that might just be because I'm still sad about the whole thing) and that she doesn't want anything to do with me for the next few days. I am heartbroken and told her so, saying that I feel unsupported, and admitted that I was struggling. She responded by saying that now that this is affecting her, she has to distance herself from me. We have been best friends for 6 years, with me always being there for her even when she didn't take my advice, and now that I am noticeably struggling first the first time, I feel as if she has abandoned me. But I also know that, to at least some degree, this is my fault. AITA? TLDR I assured my best friend that my weight loss and eating habits were under control, but she doesn't believe me and has told me she wants to take a break from me for the next few days despite me always being there for her."

104,,WIBTA if I ask my birth mom to leave me alone?,3,m24sr7,9,"I (20F) was kicked out of my birth mom’s house right before I turned 16. My parents are divorced with joint custody, so I had been visiting with my dad for a week, before going back to my mom’s. When I got back from visiting for two weeks, she proceeded to yell at me about having so much fun at my dad’s and leaving her alone, which ended in her telling me that if I liked it so much for two weeks I’d like it for two years. She told me to pack my stuff and call my dad. After she kicked me out, I decided to stay with my dad as at 16 my state allows the child to pick who they want to live with. She threw a fit. Harassed me, my dad, my step-mom, and anybody else who didn’t agree with her. Eventually, she calmed down, and after some talk with the therapist my dad had me go to, we decided if I felt ready I could visit with her. I went for a weekend, and it ended with her and I fighting for the phone my dad bought and paid for, with me then running outside, being tackled by her, and then running to a nearby restaurant and calling my dad for rescue. After that, I went close to no-contact with her. She came to my senior band performances, my graduation, and that’s it. I tried to keep up some mild contact (happy holidays, happy birthday, similar), until she threw a fit that I didn’t invite her to my graduation party. The party was filled with family members and family friends she had harrassed, and I didn’t invite her because those hosting and planing the party, and myself all agreed she would probably turn it into a big scene. After she threw a fit about the party, I went no-contact. She follows me on my public social media (I’m a design student, so I have a public page for posting projects, but my social stuff is locked down), but I haven’t actively engaged with her since my senior year of high school (~3 years ago). In college, I’ve had a lot of mental health issues. I got into therapy last summer, they started me on a mood stabilizer and an anxiety med, and after psych testing diagnosed me with PTSD due to my childhood trauma. My mom still messages me. Various things like: “I’m going to die in a year because of X rare disease”, “I’m having seizures and going to die in a year”, “I’ve got X mental illness which is why I act that way”, “your brother (4 at the time) blames himself for you leaving” etc. Whenever she does this, my anxiety spikes, and I start to shift back into panic mode. The problem is I haven’t decided if I want a relationship with her or not, and I’m worried if I tell her to leave me alone that she’ll just start harassing me. My therapist shares this concern so we’re currently working on just processing my trauma before  coming up with a plan for dealing with her. I’m not for sure if I want her to leave me alone forever or not, I just worry that whenever she messages me that it sets me back further on recovering. WIBTA if I tell my birth mom who raised me for 16 years and is the cause of my PTSD to leave me alone?"
105,,AITA for calling my mother “disgusting” and not apologizing for it after she called me the same?,3,m241x7,7,"This started with my mom barging into my room in the morning. I was groggy from having been abruptly woken up, and also very annoyed as she’s refused to knock (for the 100th time). She said that she was here to take my bedsheets to the laundry. I asked if she was able to take them right now, and she said no, so I grumpily told her to leave to the hallway and wait until I got dressed or come later.She got irate at what I said, and shouted at me that I had no right to speak to her that way. I tried to defend myself but she kept screaming over me and went on about how I was selfish, lazy, ungrateful, etc. My grandmother got involved and tried to usher my mom back to her room.My grandmother told me to ignore my mom and bring the sheets downstairs, but my mom shouted over her and said that if Grandma took my laundry then she would throw it away.Later my grandma came back into my room for laundry. My mom heard what she was doing, so she stormed to my room, grabbed my grandmother’s arm and tried to yank her away. When I asked her what she was doing, she ignored me and slammed the door. However, this time it caught on my grandmother’s foot, and I could see her wince in pain. My mom ignored my grandmother’s reaction, and I pointed it out angrily to her and said that she should apologize for hurting her.She kept screaming at me that “this is all your fault!! If you obeyed me and were more respectful this would never happen!”. My grandmother went into her room across the hall, and I took my “first-aid bag” to check up on her in case she was bleeding. My mom physically blocked the door to Grandma’s room as I tried to enter. She tore the bag from my hand and threw it away twice. She kept screeching, “I’m better than you!!” repeatedly, as well as shouting “You’re a disgusting worm filled with hatred! You’re the most selfish person in this family, this is all your fault! Deep down inside you hate all of us!”. I was angry and upset, so I couldn’t help but parrot her words “you’re disgusting” back at her. She kept shouting at me until she eventually left.She gave me the silent treatment for a month, and when the incident was brought up again, she started ranting about how hurt she felt when I called her disgusting. She said that she “could never believe her daughter would treat her this way, after all she did to raise me, etc”, and shouted over me. She said that everything was entirely my fault because if I had complied and didn’t make a fuss when she entered my room, then this would’ve never happened. She said that she doesn’t think she needs to apologize for anything. I originally planned to give a polite apology for calling her ‘disgusting’, but when she refused to take responsibility, I was fed-up and decided against apologizing. Eventually she told me to get out of her room and that she didn’t want to see me anymore, and that incident was never brought up again."

(Sorry for the typo in title)All right so I have recently moved into a apartment building. Before I was living in a house, no shared walls...a glorious feeling. In my new space I am on the middle floor. And I share some walls with my neighbors. The building is older so sometimes I hear my neighbors. But mainly I hear my upstairs neighbors. They stomp a LOT and play with their small dog often inside (no real issue with these things but I need you to know they make a lot of noise through the day everyday)My issue is that they have an alarm that goes off every morning at 6-7 AM. And I can FEEL it in my bones it’s so loud. It’s like they have it on the floor. And they often hit snooze making it go off 2-4 more times in the morning. No amount of white noise drowns this fucker out. And it’s starting to piss me off. I usually wake up an hour later and honestly being awoken before I want/need to is making me quite grumpy. Would I be the Asshole if I left them a note asking them to be more mindful and thoughtful? I worry it will come off as AH behavior since I haven’t been here long and no one in the building knows me.

We had a gerbil for three years before adopting the dwarf hamster: I did everything for him his whole life dispite him being entirely hers, alongside all care for the cat and my hamster later on in his life. I even opted out of birthday gifts in his first year in favour of a massive cage for him being bought and when he was in his final days my mum and I woke up every two hours to drip feed him water.I adore my syrian hamster and always wanted a dwarf- so when I saw the little guy being neglected I knew he had to come home with us. But, before adopting him, I drew up a chore chart and had a very serious conversation about not being able to care for another animal on my own. If my sister did not want to help, we could not have him. She promised his cage would go in her room, she would overlook his free roaming four days a week, and would clean all waters each day. Very little compared to what I do, but enough to make it manageable and enjoyable for me.The day we bought the newbie home the gerbil passed away. We were all heartbroken. The new hamster was in my room for the night, and I did ask her if she wanted to take him to a rescue if it was too hard. She said she loved him and wanted to keep him.The next day I went on four public buses to purchase a massive storage bin to DIY into the new cage. It's 540sq inches. Then four public buses back with the monster and then all daily chores and setting it up. My sister came home from a friend's and was furious over the size of the bin (I'm in the uk, so it's actually 60sq under the minimum, but he shows no stress and will inherit the larger cage once my darling old man passes on). She wanted it out of her room as it 'ruined the decor'. I want to add I let her have the room twice my size and took the box room when we moved in two weeks before as I'm moving out for uni soon and am I nice person. So now I have my syrian's 650sq cage and the bin in my tiny box room.It's been six months and she very rarely does her jobs. I also have shcool work, a large amount of housework and I also pay for everything the hamsters need (my mum pays for the cat, it's a little agreement we have).I just want to focus on my elderly syrian and enjoy my animals. If I ask her to do anyhing she stomps, shouts and my mum backs her up until I just do it all for a quiet life.I'm going to ask her to clean the sand baths and litter tray from now on as she clearly cannot handle the chores she agreed to. Is this too mean? She hates dirt and this will really upset her. I'm a kind person generally and don't want to make her upset or resentful to the pets, but I need her to learn a lesson and help- it's no longer fair on me or the animals. I feel so guilty.AITA?"
109,,"AITA for ""humble bragging"" about my grades?",3,m23kmq,38,"I am in a masters program at a university with a cohort consisting of 15 other people. Recently we got our grades back for a presentation assignment in which many people got a large part of their points deducted as they did not stick to the rubric. I stuck to the grading rubric and made sure I answered all the questions and stuck to the 5-minute presentation time allowance. My cohort and I have a group chat and many of them complained that their grades were far lower than expected and did not reflect the amount of time dedicated to completion. Curious, I asked them what the grades were and they were mostly B to C+. I got an A on the assignment and I told them that I got an A because I followed the rubric which clearly outlined the requirements and I only spent about 2 hours working on it. I said that I thought many people went overboard on the amount of irrelevant content and wasted a lot of time because of it. I got a private message from one of my classmates saying I shouldn't humble brag about my grades and that I didn't know what other people were going through in their personal lives. My intention was to let them know that they should follow the rubric (its not rocket science) and their grade will reflect how closely their work aligned with the philosophy behind assignment. I don't think I was humble bragging and I think people should take personal responsibility rather than accuse the professor of grading unfairly. Also its a masters program, the grades don't matter. Anyways, a group of them created a petition to re-grade the assignment and I refused to sign it. Now I'm being ostracized and although I don't have any evidence for them creating a new group without me, I think that happened because the group chat is nearly dead when it had been lively before."
110,,AITA For telling my cousin he is not half the man he thinks he is?,12,m1t9vo,24,"Little back round info we both are hard headed its why we started arguing, he also has to have the last word and be right. To the point of belittling the other person. Not here to talk shit, we started arguing over something as stupid a video game and even more stupid is it was about some random persons positioning on the map. Him insisting some player was with him for a brief moment and me insisting he was right next to me for like the better part of 2min during the same time. Anyway during the same argument he brings up non related debatable topics like my knowledge of the army which I have only spent 3 years in due to a parachute malfunction that left me disabled. And his 7 years, all the while belittling the the time I served. Granted he knows way more than me but the area I argue is the medical discharge portion which he only knows about through second hand. This triggered me admittedly making me lash out and say the above portion which i knew was over the line. I could tell it wounded him on some level. In my defense i was trying to stop the argument prior but he kept on going. Also after I said that he went on to be little my time in again making fun of the fact that I medically retired. I blame the armys toxicity for that more than him cause he is notably alpha mentality, but subconsciously a follower. He is my cousin and i love him so I don't want  put distence between us. What do you guys think AITA? Should I apologize? Thank you for your time."
111,,"AITA For Tattling on My Siblings, as a Grown Adult",22,m1p3zi,36,"For reference I am 27, my brother is 25, and my sister is 22. It all started around the holidays when my sister asked me if she could come visit me for her spring break (she is a teacher and I live about 8 hours away with my girlfriend). I said of course, as long as she was self-isolating correctly and felt safe visiting. I rarely get to spend time with just my sister, so I was excited to bond with my newly-adult sister. My girlfriend would also be an excellent influence on her since they have similar interests. That brings us to this week. My sister texts me that she’s looking for flights, but that my brother will come down too if she decides to drive. He doesn’t want to pay for a flight.Not only did she invite him without telling me, but my brother never discussed this with me. I let her know that we’re all adults now and she should ask me before inviting someone else to my home. She understands and apologizes. This brings us to today. My sister lets me know that my brother has decided to come visit no matter what my sister decides to do, so she’ll drive down with him to avoid complicating travel plans. Now my brother ***still*** has not asked me if he could visit, and I’m quite frankly pretty annoyed by two things:* 1.My brother not respecting me enough to ask permission to visit my home (I only have 1 guest bed)* 2.My sister is easily guilted into things and I suspected that my brother said something to influence her decision to invite him in the first place (they do not normally get along). * 3.I’ll have to play middleman between the two of them due to their constant bickering. * 4.My girlfriend is already stressed out with her Masters program so additional people visiting is even more stress that isn’t needed while we are still dealing with a pandemic.* 5.Said girlfriend has also stipulated that if my brother says anything remotely disingenuous, bigoted, or ignorant he will have to find a hotel room to stay at. Yes he is that bad. I understand where she is coming from. My sister’s visit was my mom’s idea she thought it would be great for her to get out of the house and spend some alone time with me since she never gets to do so. I let my mom know that I was worried that my brother was manipulating my sister and that neither of them had cleared the extra invite with me first and that I felt like now I was pressured into just allowing both of them to come visit. I should also mention that my cousin (who I’m very close with) will be visiting shortly after, so there would be jealousy from my brother and even more familial drama. Well I find out that my mom blew up on both of them and now neither of them are even allowed to come visit. My mom also sent me a text that is vaguely angry at me? Unsure about that one. TLDR: I tattled on my siblings for inviting themselves to my home and my mom has grounded them. AITA for not wanting my brother to visit? AITA for telling my mom about their behavior?"
112,,AITA for telling my mom I don’t care about having a new niece/nephew,16,m1rrys,17,"It’s sounds harsh but hold on til the endI’m a 21F and my brother is 32M. We have never gotten along much beyond here and there he’d show mild affection and then poof affection gone after a few days. So I grew up just not caring for a relationship with him. As we got older he turned into the golden child. He had the degrees to pay the bills for his family whereas I dropped out of college to work on my mental health due to 16 years of trauma in my life. At 22 he had my first niece. Then my second niece at 23. A few years later he met my now SIL whom has two boys from a previous relationship. I’ve never been fond of either sets of children except my oldest niece. She has downs and has always had a special place in my heart. The youngest niece is given praise to talk to me how she wants including fat shaming me... she’s 9. My brother favors the youngest son for his love for wrestling and his wife favors the youngest niece as she can be her ‘mini me’. They always post the kids on social media but never much of my oldest niece. Through the years before the marriage my brother used me as a babysitter because if I said no he’d go cry to mom and I’d be chewed out and made to it. As my mother used her “I’m paying for your college and letting you use my car” against me.Because of that control I had enough and dropped out of college because I fell into a deep depression and constraint stress over watching the kids. Later tonight my mom was on the phone and I heard her tell my brother congrats only to tell me after than they’re pregnant with what will be their biological child bringing the kids to 5. I was shocked as they constantly complain the 4 are already too much and SIL says she didn’t want anymore. My mom pranced about it around the house even though she constantly says his 4 are too much for her. Then to me especially knowing that I’ve miscarried 3 times and two were with my fiancé. I have no I’ll will for the new child. They aren’t a part of the drama that goes on between their parents and I but I feel I just don’t wanna be a part of their life. I’m not jealous or bitter towards them by no means a child is a blessing,but just don’t wanna get attached to a child I’ll never get to see. Plus I see it as reckless to have a 5th child if they say 4 is already to much to handle. My mother says I’m being cruel and hateful for not wanting to really have a relationship with the new baby AITA?TLDR brothers having a new baby. My mom and brother and I have never had a good relationship. Moms throwing it in my face knowing I’ve lost 3 to miscarriage. Brother says 4 kids is too much but turns around wanting a new child and I don’t want much to do with this new baby.Edit: my fiancé and I have our own home. I was just visiting my parents since my fiancé is a trucker and I get lonely being alone all the time.Edit: took advice from another poster and took out the unnecessary details."
113,,AITA Fighting with husband over sleep schedule,12,m1su6f,15,"Hey all,Since the pandemic started, I -much like many others- have been stuck in the house and working/studying from home. In my country we have had multiple lockdowns, varying in how strict the rules were. In the beginning I could find my rhythm, I had a strict plan on how to tackle everything, when I would go to my online courses etc. Months have passed now and I am starting to become less and less motivated. Last fall I was supposed to start my first internship at a big firm. Luckily I could still do the internship but everything went from home. Now that we are one year in the pandemic, I can see the toll it has taken on my mental health. I'm moody, extremely demotivated and don't see the point in doing anything. However, I am currently in the process of graduating for my bachelors degree and do want to finish it this year. Even though my mood is low, I am still putting in the work. Now comes the AITA problem.Ever since I could remember, I am not a morning person. I can get up if I have to for appointments, school and other responsibilities, but if it were up to me I would push everything to the late morning/early afternoon. With the pandemic I have had a lot of opportunities to wake up late (between 10:00 and 11:30 am) and still do the work that I need to do, since we are all working from home.My husband thinks differently about this. He strongly believes that having a good schedule will help with demotivation and has started demanding that I should wake up at the same time as him (between 07:00 and 08:00 am). In his eyes, if I wake up early in the morning I have a better routine for the day and that will help with my demotivation and overall sad mood. When I said that I am not a morning person, I meant it. If I don't see the point in waking up at an early time, when you can do the same things if you would if you'd woke up at a later time, I will fight you for it. This sadly has resulted in many morning fights between me and my husband on whether I should wake up or not. During those fights I will say nasty things to get him off my back and let me sleep for a few more hours. He means well, but we have different work paces and way of handling things. I am currently a full time student who was been sitting at home for the past year and lost many opportunities. He is an essential worker and has been able to go to his job every day, see colleagues and even use the indoor mini gym during the week (gyms are closed in my country). What I am trying to say is, the pandemic has not effected him the way it has effected me. And If I want to sleep in I believe I should be able to do that.  This may seem arbitrary, but it has seriously been affecting our relationship. Which is why I would like to knowAITA for fighting my husband in the morning about my sleeping schedule?"
114,,AITA for refusing to help my best friend?,13,m1smov,30,"Me (13F) and my best friend (12M) go to the same dance studio and have all the same classes. We see each other every single day.My best friend is depressed because his family is broken up and he doesn’t like his mother (who is the parent he currently lives with.) And he basically uses me as his therapist.Three weeks ago he started telling me how upset he was that everyone was more talented than him and how badly he wants to die. Hearing him say this worried me, so I tried comforting him by telling him the exact opposite of what he was saying. I wanted to help him, but he wouldn’t take it. Every time I said something that was lifting him up he’d immediately tell me about another one of his flaws.The conversation ended with me still saying positive things to him while he’s being negative. A second conversation came up two weeks ago. On this particular day he was absent from ballet class. After ballet my teacher called me to the more advanced class and had me take it. I felt good about myself afterwards, and I was excited to tell my best friend what had happened. I told him that my teacher let me try the advanced class and jokingly told him that it was fun showing off my jumps. He then went on to say how if he was there he wouldn’t have had anything to show because he says he’s bad at everything, and then told me it must be nice to have something to show off. I tried to lift him up again, but he kept talking about his other imperfections. I got angry in the middle of the conversation, and told him how it’s emotionally draining for me when he’s turning all of my positives into negatives and won’t take time to listen to what I’m saying. This got him angry too, and the conversation ended there. The next day he told me that afternoon he wanted to FaceTime, but I refused because I had to finish my schoolwork. That evening in class he showed me a scar on his wrist and said “I got upset when you told me you couldn’t FaceTime, so I tried cutting myself.” was that scar my fault? I didn’t reply.Last week he came to me ANOTHER time telling me how badly he wanted to die. I was annoyed from the get-go and told him “I’m willing to listen to your problems, but I can’t help you. Every time I offer you my help you fire it back at me and turn it into something negative.” He then told me he’s sorry and said he’d stop annoying me. I figured this was an attempt to make me feel guilty. This made me even more angry, and I told him I didn’t want an apology or something to guilt trip me.After that he said he took it back and the conversation ended there. I feel awful. AITA?"
115,,AITA for not visiting my grandmother more frequently,2,m21ou8,8,"My (f26) mother passed away unexpectedly six years ago. Both of her parents were still alive at that time. Two years ago my grandfather (from my mother's side) also passed away, leaving my grandmother to live alone in her own house. To top that off she fell from the stairs a couple of months after he passed away and broke her hip, which restricted her movement quite a bit. Her hip has healed now but she is still not very mobile (also not because of covid of course).Although her mobility is limited she is still very bright for her age (80) My visits to her have become a lot less after my mother passed away, because she would always talk about her and cry, or comment about my weight or my life and always give my chores before I leave but not before commenting she never sees me anymore. I find visiting her very depressing because I don't want to talk about my mother or my grandpa or get comments about my weight or life every time I visit, so I stopped all together, only visiting every few months with my boyfriend as a catalyst. I have had a couple of talks with my father and sister (who visit her a couple of times a week, buy her groceries and other stuff together with my uncle) and they have repeatedly said I'm an asshole for neglecting my grandmother since she is all alone and not able to go outside on her own. I think I might be an asshole for not visiting my grandmother more often. She is not a bad person by all means, she is just someone who cannot keep her opinions for herself and that bothers me a lot. AITA?"
116,,AITA for asking husband of his whereabouts,13,m1s01g,38,"AITA for wanting my husband to text me if he's left the house or when he can be expected to be home? This has been a frustrating discussion. Due to COVID, he is not as busy with work. This means that he has more free time than ever before. Ever since he got himself a motorbike, he's had more liberty to go out as and when he wants. I work normal hours and am usually home by 630pm. I have a very regular and predicatable daily routine. Oftentimes when I get home, he's not there and I am left to my own devices. I don't typically mind this, but it does get lonely. We have no kids nor pets. He has more family and friends to hand around with as we are living in his home country, whereas I moved from someplace else. Sometimes he'll get back really late, other times he won't be home at all and quickly mention that he is sleeping over at his cousin's house. There was a time he said ""just a courtesy message to let you know im at __. See you later"" at 3am. The sleepovers happen maybe twice a week, and the days out nearly daily, except weekends (particularly Sundays) cause that's ""reserved for us."" Other times I'll initiate a text earlier in the evening but I'll get no reply till past midnight, when I'm already asleep. Nothing else before that, as in way earlier in the day. In my head i'm thinking he can text earlier and mention he'll be going somewhere, right? I've mentioned before that it would mean a great deal if he could be home to have dinner with me at least, but he says sometimes I would finish late and he doesn't just want to wait the entire day for me to come home. If that is the case, I told him to just simply let me know where he'd be. I don't think he is cheating, and while I trust him and understand his need to go out, is it too much to ask for a text? And at least in between those late hang outs or whatever, he drops a message to let me know I am still thought about? He once said it makes him feel like he is being mothered, as if he needs to ask for permission to do things. This is not what I mean to do at all. It's just out of plain concern and well, also wanting to still be involved in his life, that I ask to be messaged every once in a while. It's come to a point that I myself don't text him anymore throughout my day as I'm just afraid it'll spark another upsetting discussion cause somewhere along the way I'll ask and wonder what he'll be up to and where he'll be heading off to. I'm just really annoyed and lonely at this point. Is wanting a text of his whereabouts making me too clingy or appearing like a mother? AITA?"
117,,WIBTA If I told my friend to quit trying to adopt a dog?,13,m1r94l,40,"Throw away obviously.Some background: my best friend ""Kasey"" has, for several years now, been trying to adopt a dog as an emotional support animal/travel companion/solo trip safety. She is 23, employed full-time making pretty good money, attending uni part-time, and has severe anxiety managed with medication but not therapy. Currently Kasey lives with her mum, dad, and 2 siblings in a large house. The family previously had a very sweet medium sized old dog that passed away 6 years ago.Kasey has applied for probably 10 or 12 dogs and been accepted for 4 of them that I know of. She always applies to large breeds, like over 20 kg. The first she had to turn down because she couldn't afford the (admittedly outrageous) adoption fee. The second she had to turn down because she was in the middle of moving house. The third was a puppy that she picked up from the rescue but had to return because she realized she didn't have time to raise a puppy between work and school. The fourth most recent one was an 36 kg 2 year old husky mix who was previously a feral dog that was captured after eating someone's flock of ducks to survive. It learned leash manners and basic commands while in a foster home for 10 months. She returned it to the foster after one day because she felt she was not the right home for the dog. Every single time she gets so, so excited and is immediately heartbroken.Here's what I want to know: Would I be the AH if I told Kasey to quit trying to adopt a dog until she gets her shit together, or at least finishes whatever degree she finally decides on sticking with, goes to therapy, and maybe has her own place?? I've made it clear to her that I will support her in any decisions she makes and no matter how many times she changes her mind on life choices, I'll be there to cheer her on. This has not and will not change.However, I am worried that Kasey is getting too impulsive and not making solid commitments to things that are important to her. Every few days she tells me about another anxiety attack at work or at the grocery store, or some other event that to me just screams ""I am a bit unstable and not making an effort to better myself."" I know she has listed me as a reference for the rescues, but I haven't been contacted by any of them before she gets the dog. Honestly if she tries to get another one and the rescue calls me, I would straight up tell them not to give her the dog.I'm so tired of watching her get so excited then crash and burn when things don't go her way. Kasey takes into consideration wanting a dog and all the reasons she should get a dog. But not all the reasons that should be preventing her from getting a dog or anything that could not go according to plan. Is telling her straight-up that she should quit applying for rescues and go to therapy a good choice, or should I just mind my own business and continue to passively support her through her bad decisions?"
118,,AITA for blocking my in-laws?,26,m1lrlc,19,"My husband (36M) and I (34F) dated for 4yrs before getting married. For 2/4yrs his fam is disrespectful, since they found out I was divorced.Initially the mom started (you don’t wear nice clothes, you don’t have ambition, you’re a used good in the market, you're after a citizenship/son's money (I am an MD, MPH making 4x of what H makes) etc). Reduced communication but never completely cut it off.When H had called the bro to let him know he was going to propose, bro said he had concerns citing sil’s examples. She, sister-in-law (sil), had been kind to me, supportive even, had told husbands bro that I am a liar, too emotional, unhinged. (H told me this, not exact wording). Bro has NEVER made an effort to get to know me better. He was going off of sil’s examples that my husband proved wrong.Distanced myself from being too personal, he proposed and we planned an elopement ceremony. In the mean time, visited his parents place 2x. 1st time sil ignored me the entire time, cutting me off, rolling eyes, pretending I wasn’t in the room during convos. 2nd time, father made comments on my career (Used to be a practicing MD but switched). Said he wouldn’t trust me as a physician trained in an African country (where I’m from), that my home country was not a good country, and I was now a marketer (I’m in research), despite my husband clarifying I wasn’t, he insisted.2 weeks before wedding (mutually decided no family on either side), his parents asked us to have a small traditional ceremony later, I agreed and offered help. Then dramatic calls everyday - either sil crying because she wasn’t “invited” (eventually was invited when we invited bro who is more of a friend to H, she chose to ignore the messages), and parents blamed us, or the bro refused to come because he didn’t want to without sil (who, again, was invited!?). My family in the meantime was not invited but wanted to come if his bro came, so I wouldn't be alone. The parents called to discuss the traditional ceremony 3 days before elopement and refused for my mom to be there, stating safety (my mom didn’t mind coming she would take all precautions). This escalated into father saying his sons were close up until now, that the girls side was supposed to pay for the traditional wedding but they were doing it since we wouldn’t, that my parents had decided our elopement date without consulting them.Day before elopement, bro shows up after telling us he wouldn’t. Takes H out drinking with friends and tries to get H's friends (they told me this) to get him really drunk and take him so he would miss the wedding. Sil calls everybody in common to tell them I’m a bitch (one of the people she called told me this) and 1hour before ceremony, parents call mine to tell them I’m not normal because I didn’t invite bro and I lied about reason for divorce (physical & verbal abuse - had told them2yrs prior) and I’m forcing H to sign documents. Since then I’ve blocked and deleted them"
119,,AITA for asking for coffee from my female co-worker.,16,m1onof,46,"This is kind of a delicate situation but I really feel like I am the asshole now. For context I work in the film industry but I am going to try to be vague because it’s a small world. This situation started when I (35m) bumped up to a higher paid position with more responsibility for the day. It also means that I can’t leave a room for very very long periods of time. Even for bathroom breaks. This day coincided with the first day Katie (not real name, 32f) started working on our crew. I am had worked with Katie before and am on good terms with her. I would say we are friendly but relatively recent work friends. Katie was replacing me in my job while I bumped up for the day. So, I am running around because working on set can be hectic and I am coordinating with my boss (Jim) who I am now doing the same job as. Jim is on another bigger set for the same show for the day. By the time thing die down I have to go immediately into the room that I have to babysit for the rest of the day and can not move. I had gotten myself a coffee at the beginning of the day, but because of covid restrictions and the hectic beginning of the day I sat it down without sipping it once and could not go back for it. I call Katie into the room that I am working in and say “when you get some time after we are setup, could you get me a coffee”. She looks astonished and laughs at me. I felt her mood and realized it could look like I was being needy and maybe she didn’t realize I was totally stuck and could not go anywhere so I re-assured her that I often get food and drinks for my boss because he is in the same position. She still looks very hesitant. So I drop it and say “no it’s ok, I’ll figure it out”. She leaves, I send her an text apologizing if I made her feel stressed or uncomfortable because she is new to the show and she didn’t want to be away from her job. I thought you that was the end of it. However today, she makes a comment about how her husband jokes that “did I realize I was asking her for a coffee on international woman’s day”. I didn’t know what to say, but like.... I feel so weird like, I made it very clear that this was part of my job and she was doing my job for the day, and like should I have just been more aware that me, a man, shouldn’t ask women for coffee even if when I am doing that job I do get asked for coffee? I am trying to be a good feminist in this situation but I feel like I should be able to ask for coffee... AITAH?Edit: also, AITAH for just not knowing wha to say when she made this “joke” to me about asking for a coffee, I was so astonished I didn’t say anything and she definitely thought I was upset and now I fear she thinks I am this total sexist.Edit 2: this is pretty resolved so thank you everyone for your input. I spoke to Katie about this and yes she knew she was expected to get stuff including coffee for me, however she let me know that she had come from a group of jobs that had treated her really badly and basically put her down foe being a woman by making her get coffees even though that was not in her old job description. Without saying as much she basically said it was really triggering to have me ask. Which sucks for a bunch of reasons, but yeah I don’t want to push the expectations of the job if that’s how she is coming to it. So, I plan on trying to bring a backpack with a thermos."

We have a mutual agreement worked out.She has also had cravings come on quite strongly, and often I find myself running to the grocery store for things we wouldn't usually have around the house such as Oreos and chicken nuggets. Last night, we were drinking (her non-alcohol champagne, me wine) and having a light dinner. A couple of hours later, at about midnight (I know, our dinner schedule is a bit off), she told me she was having a very strong craving for pickles. Unfortunately, we did not have any pickles around the house. I asked if salt and vinegar chips would be okay instead (since we had those), but she insisted on pickles.Our corner-store (open late) was only a short drive away, but I was quite tired and a little bit tipsy (not drunk, I did not have that much) from the wine and I did not want to risk driving, especially as a future father. I also did not want to bike tired and tipsy late at night, so I knew I'd have to walk. It would have been 20 mins there, 20 mins back, and probably 5 mins to get the pickles, so I would not have been home until about 1am. I explained and told her I wasn't up to it and could get them first thing in the morning if she still craved them then. She got upset and told me that I was being lazy and could easily go get them, and so what if I was a little tired. I told her it wasn't fair on me and I needed to sleep (I hadn't slept too well the night before). Neither of us were awake enough to keep arguing and we went to bed.It's the next day now and she isn't too pleased with me. I got her pickles even though she was not craving them quite as much anymore. We'll resolve it, but I am wondering, was I the asshole here? I could have got them even if it would have been an ordeal for me, and maybe that was important to my wife in a way I did not register last night."
122,,WIBTA if I held off telling my family exactly what I thought of them until after they’ve made good on their promises to me?,2,m255ka,2,"So, long story short, my birth family made my life incredibly stressful as a child.I won’t go into detail here but there was a significant amount of medical neglect, partially because my mother was terrified of having CPS called on her. I have a chronic health condition (congenital heart defects) and some of my mother’s choices literally could have resulted in my death or brain damage. My siblings, not wanting our mother’s rage to be directed at them instead, were not particularly sympathetic and often joined in. I was called a large number of very offensive things, and over time I started to believe them. When I graduated high school, things started to get better. Everyone just kind of pretended that nothing happened and everyone started being (superficially at least) nice to me. I fell for it. My family promised to pay for my college. As they had done this for my other siblings, I believed them. I was not given access to any of the info about the loans, and when I tried to my mom yelled at me. When I graduated, I offered to make payments as well and asked again for the loan info, but my parents declined. They wouldn’t even tell me which bank the loans were from and I didn’t get any mail about it. Two years later I finally found out what bank the loans were from when I got a call saying that no payments had been made on the loans and that my only options were to pay a lump sum or to defer on my loans and they would get sold. I didn’t have the amount needed for the lump sum, the loans got sold, and now I have to pay a set amount every month. I told my parents that I would handle it and they could fuck off, but to my surprise they have actually been sending the set amount that I have to pay every month for the loans to me directly everything month. It’s not an insignificant amount and it allows me to make ends meet a little better and actually put aside some savings since I’m not worrying as much about making the minimum payment every month. I contribute to these payments as well,obviously because I want this over and done with ASAP.The problem is, as I’ve gotten older and some of my friends have started having kids. Seeing how small a child is and how much they rely on their adults reminds me that I used to be be that small and vulnerable and that my parents saw me like that but still made the decisions that they made. I feel like I can’t keep pretending that everything is fine between us just because they’re “nice” now that I’m an adult who can stand up for herself. I want to tell them to fuck off and if I ever have children in my life (unlikely kids of my own tbh) they will not be allowed to be in contact with them.But, WIBTA if I held off on having this conversation with them until after I’ve paid off my student loans?"

124,,AITA for confronting my FIL when he asked for the rent early?,2,m24t29,4,"When my husband and I got married, we moved into a condo owned by his parents. This condo was gifted to them, so they own it outright with no outstanding mortgage. Their only costs are very low property taxes, a monthly HOA fee, and any additional upkeep they voluntarily do on the property. The reason we moved in is because my IL’s wanted to be able to claim residency in the condo to be able to transfer the low property tax to a nicer property when they retire. However, they themselves did not want to live in the property for the 2 years it requires to claim residency. My husband and I agreed that we would get a discount on rent, in exchange for helping them with the tax situation. In addition to helping with the tax thing, we also helped deep clean the condo so we could move in (it had been rented to other tenants prior to us living there), and my husband changed the locks on the condo for free.Upon moving in, my IL’s informed us that our wedding gift was going to be a free month of rent. Cool! However, we had only been living in the condo for about 2.5 weeks when my FIL texted my husband to say he was coming by for an HOA meeting and would like to stop by to collect the rent check. My husband and I were both a bit put off that FIL would ask for the rent check early, especially since a month of rent was supposed to be our wedding gift. We were concerned about this and a lack of clarification on some of the terms of the lease, so my husband asked his dad if we could meet to talk about it when he stopped by. His father agreed.  Here’s where we may be the assholes. When he came by, we sat him down to tell him our feelings about the situation. We told him we felt it was inappropriate for him to ask for the rent early and that to us it felt like it cheapened the wedding gift as we had not even been living there for a month, on top of the fact that we cleaned and provided locksmithing services to them for free just so we could move in. We also asked for some clarity on our utilities usage since water was included with the rent and I had a past landlord who was very specific about not overusing utilities. I wanted to make sure we would not be taking advantage of my IL’s or creating any kind of resentment if they felt our water use was excessive. My FIL got very offended, both that we made the cheapened gift comment, and that we would think he would be stingy about our water use. It turns out the HOA covers the water so they don’t even see the water bill. We did not know this prior to this meeting. Him and my MIL both ended up telling us they felt we were very ungrateful to them for providing us with a good living situation, mind you we did have other affordable living options available to us and we chose this one so we could help them out. Were we the AH’s for confronting my FIL?"
125,,AITA for checking where partner is,2,m24qjr,6,"Pretty short story. My partner was an hour late to a date. Texted their roommate. Turned out they had gotten high and fallen asleep. After they woke up we talked about it and they apologized and everything. Nobody told me that I did anything wrong, but I've started feeling really shitty about myself - was texting their roommate an invasion of their privacy?"
126,,AITA for not talking to my dad in the car?,2,m24lcl,14,"So I just went grocery shoping with my dad and while driving there he tried to start a conversation. It went like this:Dad: So how has school been?Me: Good.Dad: Did anything exciting happen?Me: No.Dad: What did you do this afternoon?Me: Nothing.He maybe asked 3 or 4 more questions and then told a story from his work, I dont remeber what it was. I keept my silence but note that I wasnt angry at him or anything. Just had a rough day, not enough sleep and simply a bad mood. Then after a bit of silence he asked ""Is there anything *I* did wrong?! Did *I* do something to bother you?!""So he made this whole thing about himself and him only which really pissed me of. He's very very good at this thing and basicly only happy when everything revolves around him.We finished shoping and when we got home he told me how mean it was from me to block a conversation with him and that if I ever wanted to talk to him about anything he would listen to me. Which I really didn't want to hear because it's just not true. So I said something like ""oh cry me a river"" and left.Some context information we are not close to each other at all because of stuff thats way worse than this and right now Im at the point were I try not to be in the same room with him. A couple of weeks ago I tried to talk to him about all the things he did in the past and how I feel about them but he just portrayed himself as the victim and denued any mistakes."
127,,AITA: Argument with a friend,0,m24l51,2,"I am not asking for validation or sympathy and I will accept any judgement. Context: This happened during my senior year of high school when I had a crush on a girl in one of my classes. In hindsight, I was crushing on this particular girl pretty hard at the expense of my mental health and well-being. I was in band, and the girl in question was not in band. The reason why I had a crush on this girl was because I previously had another crush on a girl in band, who got a boyfriend and then broke up. This made me angry about the sketchy dating dynamics of my high school band and its series of bad relationships that I simply decided to have crushes on other people.There were actually two conflicts that happened.1. Again, I was pissed about the drama in my high school band and dating relationships within it and used that to justify my crush on a girl not in band. I was publicly ranting about it both in real life and social media. This friend (who was in the same class as me and the crush) told me to ""take my own advice"" and to stop talking about this drama if I don't want to become involved in it. I argued back that simply mentioning/ranting about said drama does not automatically make me involved in it.2. The friend also wanted me to go to prom with him (as a friend), but I was already planning to go to prom with the crush. Since he kept asking to go to prom with him, I assumed that he was only trying to pull me away from the girl and was disrespecting my right to have crushes on girls/talk to them/pursue them whenever I want.Eventually I became so worked up that I simply blocked him on Snapchat temporarily and subsequently lost the streak.Now, I'm on good terms with the friend and unblocked him, prom never happened, and I stopped having a crush on the girl. Was I the TA? I admit that I was probably not right on certain premises and definitely in the wrong for chasing a girl so hard at the expense of my well-being. I'm not sure what to make of this situation so I will accept any judgement."
128,,AITA for moving my co-workers things?,3,m1yuzq,5,"Okay so I work as a hotel front desk associate sometimes I work from 3:00 to 11:00 at night and other times I'm night audit we have a security guard that comes in for night audit shift because we're the only ones in the hotel. We also don't have one desk at the particular hotel that I'm at we have three separate computers that we call pods, and the one I use the most is the one called pod 3 me and my manager use it the most because we genuinely have the same type of setup as to where we like things. Our security guard Jack likes to put his stuff on a particular part of pod 3 so he can talk to either me or my other partner who's a night auditor but it's been relatively busy since the vaccines have been going out for covid. A couple of nights I've had to finish closing up and closing out of my shift which I had my things in his spot because that spot I also used because it's easy for me to grab things if I need additional help to help a guest. We also only have one printer that's on what's called the mom pod it's the main central pod that has drawers that have all of our files and important documents as well as our printer and when I print my end of shift work I sign my stuff there and give it to my fellow night auditor coworker. A couple weeks ago Jack comes in while I'm still working on the pod finishing up my work for the night because we had issues during the day and he picks up my stuff and asks where I want him to put it I kind of laughed nervously and was like ""Can you please put it back where I had it?"" I could tell that he wasn't happy with that answer but he did this kind of happened over the last couple of days again and again. A couple of nights ago I got done relatively on time I gathered up my items put them on my chair printed out my end of shift paperwork filled it out on the mom pod and handed it over to my fellow night auditor. Jack comes out clearly annoyed as I'm explaining what happened during my shift to my coworker after explaining I go and clock out. When I come back I can hear Jack getting angry and talking angrily to my coworker so I ask him ""if everything was okay"" he replies ""please don't talk to me otherwise I might say something I'm going to regret"" I'm like ""what the hell does that mean"" looking over at my coworker. My coworker then tells me why he's upset and honestly I kind of rolled my eyes a little bit because I honestly think it's childish I'm still working I've been working there for 8 hours I'm finishing up my shift and literally trying to get out of there to go home and I have this guy who I thought was my friend getting ticked off that I'm basically not hurrying up enough or that when he comes in I don't move my stuff to another area so he can sign his paperwork in his usual area. I told him ""there are 50 other spots that you can fill out your paperwork"" he of course denies this and says that he's going to talk to my boss. So my question is am I the buttholl?"
129,,AITA for letting my dog sleep in the bed when my husband does not like it?,15,m1pobi,127,"My husband (39M) and me (36F) have an ongoing argument about my 1 year old dachshund mix named Quinn. She is 1 year old and is my furbaby. Almost a year to the date, I found her in a dumpster and my daughter (11) and I fell in love with her. We were looking for a dog, but my husband wanted a purebred. However, I kept Quinn and am so glad I did. She is a great dog who is trained except for maybe the occasional accident at night sometime. My husband was upset at first about me keeping her.... But eventually he started buying her toys, snacks, etc. She has slept with me from day 1 and at first my husband had no problem with it. When we moved to our new place about 6 months ago, he said that the dog being in our bedroom is stopping. She does not chew on things or use the bathroom in the bedrooms at all. She always go on her puppy pad near the door if she has an accident. Anyways, he is an over the road truck driver and is basically only home on the weekends. At first I tried to keep the dog out.... BUT I felt safer when Quinn was sleeping with me while he is gone. Before he comes home, I wash the bedding and never let her sleep on his pillows or blankets. She hardly ever even on his side of the bed because she sleep right beside me. Well, he is furious and now states he hates the dog because he does not want the dog in the bedroom. He says I am blatantly disregarding his feeling on the matter. I keep telling him that I am sorry, but I just sleep better when she is beside me. It is a major fight that we have going on for the past few months. It is only a 2 bedroom small house, and I don’t want to sleep somewhere else in the house because it is my bed. When he is home, the dog sleeps right outside my room door or with my daughter, but Quinn always wants to sleep with me. As soon as he leaves... she comes flying through the door (the door latch is kind of broken so if she pushes hard enough it just opens. She never enters the room when he is home.  💫Edit: She only uses the puppy pad maybe once or twice every 2-3 months. Like it is very rare I only mentioned it because it is one of his arguments against. It is only out for an emergency because we rent and want our security deposit back in a few months when we move again. She has not had an accident in months. Plus, we have a great marriage except for this fight. We share and compromise about everything else. EDIT: Years ago him and his ex-wife had a yorkie that slept in their bed with no problems from him. We both have talked about this immensely... and we both just want to know where we stand with the people of Reddit. This is my first ever post... so I probably did not explain as well as I should.So... AITA for letting Quinn sleep with me or should I keep the bedroom and bed off limits for her??"
130,,AITA for leaving altogether a game I've been playing with friends?,1,m249tb,6,"Context:  Lately, with some of my friends, we've been playing Diplomacy online. For those who don't know, it's a game about strategy, bluff, paranoia, and treason.  Those friend are very close ones, which I've known for over 5 years now.  But this game... I had fun while playing it, but lately it's been worse and worse.  So here we go into the problem:  I realized a few days ago while playing that I have been manipulated for a few in-game years now.  Everything has been planned by two of them, and nothing I did was out of my will.  I really, \*really\* did not appreciate that. Yet, as I am a shy, stupid hypocrite, I did not tell them about it.  But it feels like it's been a lot on me.  Each day, suffering their incessant jabs at my self-esteem.  Each day, seeing the in-game situation deteriorate, as the years went by and I lost more and more.  So yesterday, I chose to quit altogether, and completely leave the game.  Sent a message on the server we created for this specific occasion, saying I decided to abandon the game, and they reacted poorly.  Said I was rage-quitting, and that I was ruining it for everyone.  That what I was doing was altogether nonsensical, that I played like an asshole (I won't go over the details but I created a 4v2 situation because I knew these 2 were the most dangerous), and that quitting at the end just because I was losing was just idiotic and that I had to go to the end.  I don't know how, of If I should confront them about it.  It just doesn't feel fun anymore.  What should I do?  Am I the asshole here?"

Let's call him Peter (28M). This post's central conflict isn't meant to be about the Tinder/dating part of it, but I'm just providing context.1. We met at a bar and he was extremely forward about kissing, touching, sex, etc. and ignored how I felt about hooking up on a first date, so I angrily left. He was also very condescending about my age for some reason, laughing about my age and calling me things like ""oh so naive"" ""innocent"" in a condescending tone.2. This was fine, but he was condescending about my age again.3. We were drinking at his place and watching stand-up comedy together. He texted me beforehand that he didn't want to have sex and I was totally ok with that, so I even wore glasses and my ugly/comfortable bra & underwear. He kept initiating foreplay & we did literally *everything* but sex, but then didn't want sex. I was angry about the miscommunication so I left. 4. We went on a hike 1 week ago and this was actually fine. He apologized and we planned something for this Friday afternoon. He spent lots of time talking about his dating life, in particular one girl (lets call her Valerie) who he's interested in.Last night I texted him to make solid plans for this Friday. Peter mentioned that he might have plans in the city ""in theory"" on Friday afternoon. He vented to me and said that he is ""on edge"" from meeting Valerie, how he bombed the first date with her, but that he finds her fascinating and he could maybe see a path with her.I thought it was weird of Peter to vent his dating life to me - felt like he was rubbing it in my face. He told me that Friday might be fine for plans with me and if I could ask him again tomorrow. I replied:>It's okay, I understand if a date went poorly. To be honest, I think it's really rude to double schedule, not give much of a heads up, and asking me to ask you again tomorrow. We were clear that we are trying to be friends and I declined other Friday afternoon/night invitations, because I didn't want to double schedule. I'm more than happy to help friends through tough situations, but friendship is earned.    >  >Lets just call off Friday plans for now. Let me know later if you're feeling better and want to hang out 🙂 He sent a couple texts saying how sorry, agrees that it's disrespectful, that he forgot to put our plans on his calendar, and that he was tired and he'd text me the next morning when he's figured out his calendar.This morning he apologized again and suggested a plan for Friday. I replied:>That sounds fun, but I'm sorry, I already committed to other plans yesterday evening. Go on the date with that chick instead and let's plan something for another day?He replied with ""sg"".My last text could've been worded better. I definitely think Peter has some sort of power kink or wants to feel like his dating life is better than mine. AITA for cancelling Friday plans with him?"
133,,AITA for not noticing that the cat was ripping up the carpet?,1,m23vkz,7,"My roommate got foster cats last month, so we currently have two kittens. She's the only one on all the official paper work and stuff so they are technically her cats, but we have an agreement that we're fostering together so I pay for half the toys and do half the cat chores (litter box, writing adoption bios, feeding, etc.). Last week, the girl got spayed, and so we have to keep her from doing running, playing, jumping, etc. for a 10-14 days. She also needs to be separated from the male so that they don't roughhouse. I volunteered to keep her in my room because I don't have much furniture so she can't be too crazy.It is really hard to keep a 5 month old kitten quiet. For the past 7 nights, I've been woken every hour to two by her meowing constantly at my door, jumping on stuff, and pooping in the litterbox (my room is small so obviously I must get poop immediately or it is unbearable.)This morning I found some of the carpet torn up, it looks like she was trying to dig under the door. My roommate got pissed at me and thinks that I didn't stop her from being destructive and it can't possibly have been from one night and that she doesn't believe that I didn't hear her ripping up carpet in the middle of the night.I am tired as fuck from waking up constantly and I swear she really did just do it in one night (she's gotten more antsy and less groggy from meds as it's now 7 days post-op.)

135,,AITA for telling my friend that I don’t agree with her registering her cat as an emotional support animal just so she didn’t have to pay the additional fee?,24,m1llq0,88,"Hi Reddit so I’ve been getting a lot of mixed opinions and I would really like to know if I was the AH in this situation. So my (24F) friend (23F) has been living in her apartment complex since early 2019. She didn’t get a cat until about 6 months later and never registered her pet or paid a fee. She eventually got caught and a couple of days ago, she received a letter stating she has an unregistered pet and will need to pay a $300 fee plus a $20 fee every month. Just an FYI, our entire conversation was over text message. She was venting to me, saying she was annoyed, didn’t agree with the fee, and said it was BS. I was asking questions about the situation like how did she get caught, what the letter said, etc. I told her that I understand it’s expensive and it seems like a lot for an animal that sleeps throughout the day. She flat out said she refused to pay and said she registered her cat as an emotional support animal to avoid the fee. I was getting annoyed with the topic because we had been talking about it for 2 hours at that point so I started replying with one word answers. She eventually caught on and asked why I was suddenly salty about it. I told her I didn’t agree with her but she can do what she wants. She then said “Oh let’s hear it, why don’t you agree?” I said that it’s just part of living in an apartment complex and having the responsibility of a pet. She replied “Lol ok.” I then said “What? You asked why I didn’t agree with it and I told you. We can agree to disagree. It’s just not something I would do personally, but you do you.” She ended up leaving me on read and we haven’t talked since. So AITA for telling my friend that I don’t agree with her registering her cat as an emotional support animal just so she didn’t have to pay the additional fee?"
136,,AITA for being concerned about my girlfriend buying a brand new 2021 Mazda?,9,m1s6nq,57,"I (m21) have been with my girlfriend (f20) for just over 2 years now, and while we've had our fair share of issues, I love her, and truly see a future with her. However, we have different viewpoints on money, and has been a point of contention between us before. I grew up not destitute, but not exactly living a life of luxury. My parents sold drugs, my grandparents were one major illness away from losing their house, especially with the added burden of having to take care of me and my sister.My girlfriend, on the other hand, has lived a comfortable life. Not a 1% life, but a ""Speeding tickets are a minor inconvenience"" comfort, if you understand(Until recently).On to the main point of the story, last week, my girlfriend had been hinting that she was going to reveal something after she got back from a work trip (she does property maintenance work), and I, being an impatient motherfucker, kept guessing at what it was until she revealed that she had gone out and bought a brand new 2021 Mazdaspeed 3 at >$32K CAD ticket price. I was floored. We do have separate finances. We don't live together, she lives with her parents and I live with my dad. I have my own sets of bills that she doesn't involve herself with, and vice versa. Merely a week prior we had been discussing potentially getting a place together, as her families apartment is getting cramped, and I have my own issues with my household.Anyways, after telling me about her purchase, she proceeded to describe it as an ""impulsive purchase"" and that completely threw me. A 32k impulse purchase AND the fact that she planned to just spring this on me? (At this point, to make this as fair as I can with my biased perspective, the end price that she's making payments on is closer to 20k, as she traded in her current car, a 2010 Mazda 3, and had a down payment ready.)I have a well known problem of being unable to stay grounded and in the moment, so my responses ended up coming across as standoffish and unexcited about her new car, which upset her, and she now feels like I'm unexcited for her and her new purchase. My issue is that if she's making ""impulsive purchases"" of this size now, when we're still young and not making much money in our respective fields or having actual careers yet, what happens when we do have money? Is she just going to make another ""impulse purchase"" down the road of 40k and be like ""Surprise"" as it gets dropped off in the driveway? It kinda kicked off a series of ""What if...?"" questions in my head, and so I've kinda been off and not very talkative. Today, she questioned me about why I haven't been very supportive or excited about the car and I told her, it's not that I'm not excited, but making a self described0 ""impulse"" buy of >32k, and the fact that she was just gonna spring it on me and not even *mention* it to me before showing up with it when she got back was not a good look. Her main response was ""I'm not stupid, I've got a plan"", and we left it at that.AITA?"

I meditate, I work hard, I contribute and try to ease housework, spend time with them, but I’m unhappy. They’re always bickering and fighting. Extremely rude and egoistic. And don’t care or respect themselves. I can be and do so much more. I’ve worked very hard to break this conditioning. But the idea of leaving them, when my brother is undergoing dialysis is guilting me. AITA for choosing to leave them?"
139,,AITA For wanting very expensive makeup and cosmetic products,0,m20i1j,52,"I've (13) always been very insecure about my appearance  and my family often teases me about it ""you're like a tree every year when I see you you get one round bigger"" and "" you have the biggest nose, you're lips are so black and ugly "".I know they're just joking but I've always been sensitive. I wanted to wear makeup because I thought that maybe it would help me feel more confident, and let me express myself .My mom finally let me get makeup, but she asked me to check with my sister (21) . She told me that the amout of money we would be paying for the makeup was absurd, and that I could not justify the amount that I would be spending. I really want to get makeup but I know that my sister would be angry about it and criticize me for it, I know that I'm probably the a-hole but I want to know what you guys think"
140,,AITA for not doing my part in this group project?,6,m1rfy7,54,"Relatively short post. Im literally only making this because none of my friends are awake at this hour to answer for me and I wanna figure out how much work I should stress over tonight lmao. Also yes I'm aware this is a trivial problem but where else to post but here, right? (Context: I'm a high school junior)To keep it short, I'm in a group project with someone thats super studious. Always gets good grades, teachers pet, that kinda deal. Im the opposite, often turning stuff in late and getting average grades. This project is in two parts, an essay and a presentation. The presentation is a group presentation that we're graded on as a group, and the essays are individually graded, however based on a similar topic as each others. We have recommended due dates set by the teacher but they aren't enforced. In essence, this person texts me semi-frequently asking me to finish my essay (the individual part, remember?) and sort of peer pressuring me to finish. Im dealing with a lot of other stuff atm, so it's a pretty low priority for me, and because of this I keep lying saying i'm working on it. Should I feel bad for ""not doing my part?"" Keep in mind I've ensured that I'm doing about the same amount of work as her on the group-graded presentation part. So, Reddit, AITA?"
141,,AITA for not forgiving my sick grandma,14,m1m822,22," Hi, long time lurker, first time poster here! I'm Also on mobile so I'm sorry for any mistakes! Okay so some background:Me (18nonbinary), my brother (21m), and my mom (43f) all live together because of a mix of reasons (college, covid, etc) but we're getting ready to move in to my grandma's (63f) house so we can take care of her because she's sick. Okay onto the situation: My grandma and me haven't had a good relationship since i was maybe like 12yo. This is mostly because of my gender identity and my sexuality among some other personal things that only my therapist and a few others know. I've long since accepted that she'll never respect me or apologize so I've just kinda given up on a relationship with her. My main issue now is that since we're moving in with her, she's trying to be a part of my life again. She keeps trying to engage me in conversations and activities (none of which are things I'm interested in btw) to build a bond again, but I'm not really interested if I'm being honest. She's hurt me a lot and never apologized for any of it.  My mom and my dad (68m) are constantly trying to get me to forgive her or at least ""put it in the past"" for everyone's sakes. But I dont want to. It's not like I'm rude or anything either, I'm still civil with her. But I keep being told I'm in the wrong for not reciprocating and holding a grudge. I'm kinda torn now so tell me reddit, aita?"
142,,AITA for not making more of an effort to talk to my grandpa ?,4,m1sa47,20,"Tonight I got into an arguement with my sister when she basically called me an asshole saying my grandfather has done so much for me and I should make more of an effort to talk/see him. This all came up when I had mentioned that he messaged me on facebook saying ""just a line to let you know I'm still alive"". He contacts me on messenger by sending me a thumbs up or little comments like this when he could just call me on messenger or video call me. He has my cell phone number and never bothers trying to call me, then lies about it saying he has tried to call me. I have made sure my new number was in his phone and everything because I hadn't actually gotten any calls from him. Apparently he always whines to my family about how I never come see him or talk to him but never actually tries to contact me. Apparently I'm the asshole because I'm obligated to put in all the effort to see him since 2 years ago he let me live with him for 3 months and because ya know hes old and I wont get that much more time with him.Edit for the record before when he'd send me a thumbs up or something minimal like that I would call him but since he wants to be passive aggressive towards me and guilt me instead of actually try to contact me to conversate I won't bother."
143,,AITA for being annoyed when my fiancée took forever at Scrabble?,5,m1r5o3,13,"It was a Sunday. She had gone into work earlier in the day and I had been getting my own stuff done at home (work and personal).I had some work left to do when she returned home in the afternoon, but not an overwhelming amount. We decided to go grocery shopping and make dinner. While grocery shopping, we realized it was nice out, so we added in a walk and outdoor ping pong between shopping and dinner.After making and eating dinner it was about 7:20, and I was feeling the urge to knock out my work. She suggested we play a board game. I mentioned my work, but also did some quick math in my head and figured that a board game shouldn't take all night--maybe a bit past 8:00. And it would be nice to spend some more couple time together, so I said yeah--let's do it.We decided on Scrabble and got out the board. Right after the first move, she got a work call she needed to deal with. After 20 minutes or so, she finished it and came back to play.Usually, I win when we play Scrabble.  This time, two things were clear: first, she was playing for keeps, and second, she was very quickly pulling ahead.As the game went on, her turns started taking longer and longer as she tried to make the perfect word to increase her lead. We were listening to music, and I noticed multiple songs were going by during one of her turns...song one, two, three, four...which turns out to be 10+ minutes for a turn.After a little bit, I semi-jokingly told her we'd need to limit her turns to one song per turn. She acknowledged the comment, but then kept on agonizing over her moves. I was getting bored and starting to really get antsy about getting my work done. This wasn't couple time anymore, either--95% of the time was just her figuring out her move.As the clock hit about 8:50, I tried to lightly mention again that we should move the game along and wrap up, hopefully not too long after 9:00. Her response was that if the game was taking too long, we should just pause and resume later.At this point, I was somewhat annoyed that the game was taking so long and she hadn't started to play any faster despite knowing that I had work to do. I had no interest in coming back to the game another day if was going to take that long to play, so I told her we should just finish it.We finished the game (not too long after 9:00) and I went off to do my work she went off on her own as well. When I came down for water later, I tried to resolve the situation by acknowledging that I had been a bit annoyed, but that I had gotten enough time to get some work done and was getting over it--nothing to worry about.However, she became annoyed that I had been annoyed. She felt that my idea of an appropriate amount of time for a Scrabble turn was arbitrary, and that if I needed to get work done, I should have made my point more clearly or just stopped playing.AITA?"
144,,WIBTA for asking our roomate to move out at the end of our lease?,5,m1r369,13,"So basically in November of last year Me (21NB) My girlfriend (20F) and a friend of ours (19NB) moved into a small two bedroom together. For backstory, Roomate was in my understanding a good friend of GF, and I knew them vaguely online (think instagram). We signed a 12 month lease, and the thing is, I’m already feeling awful in this living arrangement and have been for a while. Roomate is a perfect housemate as far as practicality goes Pays on time, cleans up after themselves, is quiet and keeps to themselves, and contributes to any household funds/dutys ect. But personality wise... I just don’t think we click. They’re extremely quiet and don’t talk much, and that makes it hard for me to read people. I honestly think they hate me and GF sometimes. I didn’t expect us all to be buddy buddy, and of course I don’t want to force them to get along with us, but I feel uncomfortable in my own home. Like I’m tiptoeing around them not wanting to upset/anger them. But then again, they’re just a quiet and non-expressive person so I feel bad holding that against them.Now, the tension isn’t the only thing. I just think that as a couple it was a terrible idea to have a Roomate anyway. We did it because we live in a place where Rent is expensive and it was easier with another person to split the price with, but it’s actually not bad. We could pay just fine with a little more intuitive I think. With a roomate its hard to be a couple - we don’t want to make them uncomfortable with PDA, and it’s hard to make the place feel like home with an extra persons taste / space to think about, and if they were to move out we could really make the place feel like our space. Recently I’ve been gone for work purposes for a month and I think tension between Roomate and my GF have hit the roof. GF struggles with her mental health and hasn’t been doing her part of the housework like taking out trash and cleaning her mess, stuff normally I’m there to help with. A mutual friend recently let me know that Roomate had been tweeting about their frustration with GF. I kind of side with them on it because GF isn’t being a good house mate, but I’m also a little upset that roomate is tweeting about it rather than bringing it up with us. So after all this, I want to let them know that come november this year I want to renew the lease but just for me and GF, and ask them to move out so we can live together, or, alternatively, state that we will be moving into a place for just the two of us so they need to find new roomates. But I feel bad also because I know that they are studying at university here and if they can’t find friends to move in with / somewhere else to go, they may not have options. I don’t want to leave them without a place to go. But I also don’t see anything else to do, as I don’t think anything but going our seperate ways will help...So: WIBTA if I told Roomate that I want them to find someone else to live with?"

He copies down very slow, class ended already. I told him I will send him a copy of my work and left the meet.    After school, the teammate emails me angry and that he told the professor about my selfishness, irresponsibility and being un-cooperative. I replied that in the case of the snitchery being true, I would tell the professor about his in-class inqppropriate absense today.Thoughts on this situation?Edit: The professor I am talking about, is not the basketball YouTuber."
147,,Aita if we gifted fish,7,m1nodv,25,"So long story short I (20f) live with my bf H (24m), his brother M (35m) and his gf L (30f). It's a small house with a bigger backyard. This summer L decided that she wanted to build a pond and have plants and other stuff inside this pond. H and I gave her some goldfish for her pond because she said she wanted fish in there. They were all super happy and are still alive today. What happened when it became winter was H decided to take the fish in and figure out what to do with them in the meantime so that they wouldn't freeze due to Ls neglect. L decided to go out and buy rocks, filters, food, a heater, and all the decorations for these fish. She's now saying that she doesn't want these fish anymore and that they're ours. She said the only reason that she's been feeding them everyday is because she didn't want them to starve. These fish have been in a nasty tank because she doesn't clean it at all as well. Because she said they were ours and we had an argument that they were, I decided to clean the tank today, feed them, and buy new food and such for them. She then decided that she was going to feed them again saying she didn't trust that I did. So here's where I could be the asshole, I told both M and L off for saying it was ours because they kept arguing with me and M automatically took Ls side, I then said that if she wants to keep feeding them she can take them back because they were hers in the first place. I'm so mad because this isn't the only issue we've had with each other and she acts as if us being younger than her makes us into children who can't do anything on their own."
148,,AITA for blowing up at my brother?,5,m1omyh,15,"I (21f) and my older brother (23m) do not get along. We never really have, even as kids, and now as adults our differing viewpoints make trying to foster a better adult-sibling relationship difficult at best. My brother is in the military, so I try to stay as no contact as I can until he visits. For context, I still live at home with my parents, so when he visits I don't really have a choice in the matter. I'll be moving out later this year to move in with my fiance and move closer to college so I can finish my Bachelor's. My brother is currently visiting (I know, pandemic. Like I said, I don't have a choice in the matter.). Why I hate being around him so much is because he picks apart *every single thing* I do or say. Whether it's talking to my parents about an assignment I'm working on, mentioning my workday, or simply commenting on a show we're watching, he has something snarky to say in response. He criticizes my choice to go to college, my financial decisions, even my fiance and our choice to get married. He feels the need to comment on everything and boast about how much better he's doing in the military and that if I was ""smart enough"" I'd join the military like him. Not like I can, I'm physically disabled, but he doesn't believe in disabilities. Every time he's around, I spiral into a deep depression due to how insecure and pathetic he makes me feel. (He knows. My parents have tried to tell him to back off, I've told him to back off, expressed my feelings, etc. His response is ""I'm not going to censor myself to save your feelings"") He and our little sister get along great, even though personality-wise my sister and I are generally quite similar, which makes me feel like this isn't just his personality, like he has something against me specifically. Last night, I blew up at him. To be entirely honest, I don't remember all the words that were said, I just remember that he made a rude comment about how I'm an idiot for going to college and ""wasting my time and money."" (Note: the career I'm going into requires at the very least a Bachelor's degree). Then, he made another condescending comment about how if I want an education I should go into the military. I responded angrily, saying something along the lines of ""At least I'm not making the military bail me out because I don't have anything better to do with my life."" He got mad, I went to my room, and we've been avoiding each other since. I'm sure I'm wrong for the words I said, but am I completely the asshole in this situation? I feel like after all the hurtful comments and attempts to get him to stop, maybe I'm a little justified in what I said. Or maybe this is just my eldest daughter/middle child insecurity boiling over and I unjustifiably took it out on him. Sorry for the long post, I tried to give as much context as possible, but if you feel you need more please feel free to ask me."
149,,AITA For Having a Camera In My Livingroom That My GF Didn't Know About?,4,m1okh3,57,"Excuse the formatting I'm new to reddit and also not particularly good at grammar. So I recently broke up with a girl who robbed me for about a grand on her way out the door. When she left I bought a security camera and hid it my living room. Fast forward a month and I get back together with my kids mother. (We'd been separated about 3 years and not on the best terms but are currently trying for the kid) She didn't know there was a camera. I didnt check the camera when she first moved in. I almost forgot it was there. After about 3 weeks of her living with me I caught her talking to other men and meeting up with one of them (Just at a restaurant as far as I know.) That's when I started checking the camera. Now she still didn't know about the camera but it's in my living room. Not in the bedroom or (yikes) the bathroom. Just the living room, pointed at the couch and the area you walk through to get to my bedroom. So for the last 2 months I've been busting my balls working two jobs. And she works one, about full time job. We've been fighting over how messy the house is and why nothing ever gets done. So now I start questioning how she spends her two days off and 3 days she doesn't work until 5pm.  I'm not home much but when I am I try to clean or be productive or do something around the house. Now I don't believe that the house is a woman's job. We're raising a strong and independent little girl. But because of how much I  work I need her to pick up the slack around the house.So this is were she saying I'm the asshole. I have the camera in the living room. She's swearing she wakes up and cleans all day and what gets done is the bet she can do with the kid. But because of the camera I know she lays on the couch until about 11am - 12pm most days. Sometimes much later. So in the heat of the argument and her swearing she  didn't lay on the couch all day I revealed the camera. She's now redirecting the argument and saying I'm crazy and it was a massive invasion of her privacy. I can see how shes upset why she didn't know about the camera but this is my stance. I didn't buy the camera to spy on her. I didn't start watching the camera once she moved in to monitor her behavior I litterally caught her ""cheating"" on me and that's why I started watching it again. And I used it to catch her in a long and on goin lie that was putting a strain on our relationship. P.s. I wake up early af and I have a hard time sleeping hen she up and doing things. When I come home I want to hang out with my family. Put the kid to bed. And then spend time with her. But he wants to clean until 12-2 at night. Which keeps me up when I have to wake up at 5am and restricts any time we have to spend together. So reddit, I ask you, AITA?Edit: spelling and grammar."

151,,AITA for not giving my boyfriend’s dad starbucks?,8,m1nz42,27,"Okay so my boyfriends family treats me well, I have no problem with them for the most part but his dad has pissed me off this week. Saying my joke “Ian is a sociopath for all I know! 🤣”. I mean, it’s not funny, but everyone knows I am sarcastic for the most part. The context is that Ian my boyfriend is so charming that it is fake, he is sort of a control freak about mundane things such as two ply toilet paper. I accept him for that. We both make fun of each other a lot and it’s no offense to sociopaths, but it’s a hyperbole. His dad said “That’s not funny. Ian happens to have feelings, nothing you said was funny and you will offend a lot of people if you say stuff like that”. I got silent and looked at my boyfriend when his dad was turnt around giving a stank eye like wtf is this. I was quiet and weirded out with his dad the whole night. Ian was ashamed and told him to apologize& that it’s a different generation & he says more jokes about me , he didn’t apologize. Today, I asked everybody but his dad if anyone liked starbucks & what their favorite drink was. I even asked Ian’s friend’s girlfriend what drink she wanted. I even asked if her dog was ok with a puppichino. I felt like it’s my money and I should do what i want with it and if i don’t really want to associate with someone, I don’t have to. I didn’t know Ian’s dad walked in & it was awkward cause he saw everyone having starbucks except him. He looked sad and he had to bitch to his wife about it saying I am being rude.

My dad would technically give me the money and i wasn’t supposed to spend it on anything particular so i really dk how to feel cause i’ll feel really bad just walking in with it and them getting mad at me, i am going behind her back but there would be no point in telling her cause she’s so nosey and i wouldn’t be able to get them if i didn’t, i think i’m just gonna put my foot down.

153,,AITA for asking my daughter if she’d rather not get help for her learning disability?,2,m1qy8j,56,"Sounds harsh, but I’ve been under a lot of stress lately.My daughter’s (11F) learning disability has caused her to fall painfully behind in the public elementary school she attends.She had previously already been held back one grade and after her teachers said that she wouldn’t be able to graduate this year either my husband, her stepfather, said that he was sick of family and friends asking why she wasn’t graduating and that people were probably speculating that we were lying or in denial about how “ challenged” my daughter really was. We ended up getting a recommendation about a school for learning disabilities that was supposed to be the best. It was two hours away and for the amount of extra money we’d have to pay for her to be boarding instead of day student, I could either rent an apartment and stay with her, paying for day to day after school living expenses.However, my sister in law ( widowed by my late brother) lives in the area and for her to take care of my daughter, she’d only ask for a third of what would have been school “ room and board” money for the school year.My daughter was accepted for Fall of next year and I agreed with my sister in law that I’d send her a monthly check so my daughter could live there after school alongside her four other cousins.I talked to my husband and he said he didn’t know what kind of good marriage really has a wife in one place and her husband in another. In addition, I had made a pledge for 2021 to get more involved in his business operations and I don’t want to leave him in a position where he’d have to ask his estranged son to step in and temporarily head operations until he found someone else he could trust.So the past weekend I took my daughter to my sister in law’s place to give her a rundown of who she would be sharing a room with and to drive her around the campus of her future school. My daughter started crying and saying she didn’t want to be in such a noisy house without me and that she didn’t want to go to this school. I told her that my place right now was with her stepdad and that her aunt has always been the best aunt she could be. I asked my daughter if she’d rather just not get help so she could finally move on to middle school and learn at the same level as her same aged peers. She asked again why I couldn’t come with her and I said I already told her that and she needed to do this unless she’d like to be unable to finish homework and tests on her own forever.

My friend has been struggling with mental health. She came to me December last year and asked for my help. She is depressed and has struggled with this for a while. We spent a few months over text helping each other out. We have a group chat with a few mutual friends. We tend to have our differences and argue a bit on the group chat but it’s usually over petty things like video games our football (soccer, I’m from the uk). She tends to take these arguments personally and usually comes to me aggressively complaining that I didn’t take her side in the argument or that I didn’t take sides at all. She tends to get quite personal and insult me where I naturally insult her back. But we usually get over this and move on. However, I’m a male and have been questioning my sexuality and I came to her for advice because she has been thru this before and is also not straight. It might have been wrong coming to her as she was already in a bad situation so I might of made her worse by putting my problems on her. One night we had another argument which I wasn’t involved in and I just tried to get everyone to stop fighting. It was about a video game so it wasn’t anything worth arguing about. She came to me claiming that I took the other side and that I’m just like everyone else and that I don’t care about her. She threatened to out me to the group which I completely didn’t want happening.Today she has come to me saying this is all my fault and what I do makes her mental health worse. I couldn’t t take it emotionally till the point I ended up blocking her. She was being borderline abusive to me and I didn’t know what to do so I blocked her. I don’t want to decline her mental health by not being there for her and I’m worried things might get worse for her without help. But i don’t know if I should continue our friendship when she says and does these things to me. I don’t know if she can help it.Am I the asshole?"

So my mother is saying now how if I bring it up again I just flat out won't be able to go. The training has already started and it's in under 3 months. So people of reddit am I the asshole?"
157,,AITA for refusing to call someone until my song ended,0,m1zoad,49,"So my dad(60) and I(m17) were on the way to pick up something we saw on Craigslist and he wanted me to call(he forgot his phone at home) the person we were going to see to give them an update on when we were gonna be there. Now, I'm quite passionate about music especially late 60's to mid 80's classic rock and I can't go anywhere without my music especially on car rides. I was already 3 minutes into Won't Get Fooled Again by The Who, which if you don't know is in my opinion a beautiful 8 minute masterpiece and would 100% recommend giving it a listen. Anyway he wanted me to call this guy but to me it's sacrilege to pause a song like that and I told him I'll call when the song is over but then he got mad and didn't understand why I couldn't make the call first and pause the song and so I asked him why I had to make the call that instant but he didn't give an answer and just said I was doing it just to be an asshole"
158,,AITA for inviting my sister on my fitness journey to prepare for my wedding?,5,m1m4hu,77,"We finally booked a wedding date! T-7 months to go!We're all super excited and I know that my fiancée is going to look smoking. She's already planned to drop another 5 lbs and get some muscle. I love that woman! I also want to look good and decided to get into a fitness journey. Train for a 5k and then a half marathon to lose about 15 lbs and put on some muscle by working out 2-3 days a week. My sis is just a bit overweight, bless her. I know she's going to be real jealous of my fiancée and me, and I invited her to join me if she likes. I tried to be as tactful as possible: I told her we're both planning to use the opportunity to shed those few lbs everyone wants to, right? If she wants we can train together for the same 5k  and we can also keep each other honest with workouts and work off some program.She didn't take it kindly of course and now my mom is shouting at me for fat-shaming my sis. SMH. Asshole or not?"
