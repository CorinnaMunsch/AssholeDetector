0,2021-03-18 04:07:08,Everyone Sucks,1461,m77ysg,228,"AITA for telling a child that ""nobody cares""?","Today I had to look after my 12yo niece. I'll call her ""Rachel"" for this.Rachel is a very ""busy"" kid. She's very smart and does these mathematics competitions, and she's come first place three years running. Outside of that, her and her mother (my sister) have a little fashion blog on social media which a lot of girls in the area, including my 12yo daughter ""Molly"" follow. I'm glad that the kid has hobbies, but one unfortunate side effect is that she talks about herself a lot. We've been on family outings before, and this kid will literally dominate a conversation talking about her competitions or her fashion stuff or something else. My sister encourages this. I do get that she's proud of her daughter and wants the best for her, but the kid is very self centred. Today when Rachel came, she was wearing a cute dress and asked if she could take some pictures for her blog. I didn't mind but she kept telling Molly to get out of the shots, and when Molly asked if they could take some pictures together, Rachel's response was ""Ew, no!"" This really upset Molly, and I told Rachel because of that I didn't want her taking her blog pictures in our house. Later Molly was doing some homework and I asked Rachel to help. She had a look at it and then laughed. She said this kind of stuff was too easy for her competitions and that Molly was ""dumb"" to struggle with it.That was the final straw for me. I told Rachel that nobody cares about her fashion blog or her mathematics competitions, and that she was a self centred bully. This made Rachel cry, and when my sister showed up Rachel hugged her and told her what I said. My sister said ""How could you say that to a child?"" I told her that her daughter was using her hobbies to torment and upset Molly and needed to be told it was not appropriate. My sister took her daughter without saying goodbye. I do feel bad about making the kid cry. Truly I do, but at the same time she was bullying my daughter and needed to be stopped."
1,2021-03-18 01:16:46,Everyone Sucks,2331,m7414v,694,"AITA for calling another student ""Reduced lunch"" after he called me ""Daddy's money""?","Bit of background, I live in a middle class home, my parents drive a Camry and an Accord. We are not rich by any means, just my parents are frugal with what they have and they also invest the money they do save. There is this kid call him Jeremy, who has just been a jerk to me. He is a good bit taller than me and weighs more than me too. I had to get some paperwork done (had a note) and I was gonna be coming back to the cafeteria. I was going to Chick Fila and texted my friends if they want anything (they would pay me back venmo). So I brought back some sandwiches and fries . Jeremy comes over and is like Daddy's money saying that I am exploiting my friends for asking them to venmo me back for their orders when my dad is paying for it. This is not the case at all its just him trying to harass me again. (he also did this with SAT scores he said the only reason I got my score was because of my prep classes my dad paid for). I was like nope this is with my money not my parents. He and his friend both called me ""Daddy's money"" again. I told him f\*ck off reduced lunch. He got super red, called me some explatives and ran off. A lot of people said it was f\*cked up what I said but I don't get it. If he thinks its okay to make fun of my family for being well off why is it not okay for me to make fun of his for being irresponsible. I was going to say ""mommy's welfare"" but decided agains it."
2,2021-03-18 04:53:24,Everyone Sucks,186,m7910j,140,AITA For telling my GF to shut up about a personality test she took,"My GF (21F) and I (22M) are college students and have been together for almost 2 years. She recently took one of those personality tests (I think they are called Meyers-Briggs or something like that) on Buzzfeed or some other time-wasting website and it has since become somewhat of an obsession. After she took that first test, she started searching for different ones on the internet and kept bragging about whatever personality type she kept getting.  She got a lot of her friends to do them too and now it's like it's all they talk about.One day she tried to get me to take one and I refused. She wouldn't let it go so finally I agreed to let her just ask me the questions. When it was done she told me the results were ""exactly what I thought you would get. This is so exactly you."" Then she sent messages to all her friends about me taking the test and how she called exactly the personality type I would get.  Ever since I took the test, she brings almost everything I say or do back to that personality type. Like, I will say or do something and she will say ""Oh, that's such a (insert personality type here) thing to do haha."" The other day I was working on something for school and getting frustrated by it. She noticed and said ""Getting frustrated like that is such a common trait in people with your personality type."" I was already frustrated by what I was working on and kind of snapped back at her with ""Is being annoying as hell a common trait of your personality type?  Just shut up about that stupid personality test, I'm tired of hearing about it. It's all you've been talking about for weeks.""I immediately knew she would get upset by what I said and I tried to apologize right away, but she went to her room and closed the door and wouldn't let me in. I gave her some space and when she finally came out I apologized for snapping at her. She said she just finds that kind of thing interesting and said I was a jerk to talk down to her like that. I told her I was annoyed with her relating every aspect of our daily lives back to that stupid test. I told her I don't care about whether or not the way I fold my laundry or do the dishes coincides with whatever personality type some BS online test says I have. She said she would stop bringing it up all the time, but that I didn't need to be an asshole about it.Then, just yesterday she brought it up again when she was talking to me about her friend's recent break-up. She said that her friend's ex was doing a classic (whatever personality type) move and that since her friend is a (whatever personality type) that they will just never work as a couple. At that point I pretty much just stopped listening and walked away. She asked me why I was ignoring her and I told her I don't care about that stupid personality test stuff so I was going to do something else. Now she thinks I'm an even bigger asshole for ignoring her, even though she agreed to stop bringing that stuff up all the time."
3,2021-03-17 18:41:30,Everyone Sucks,460,m6wp23,197,AITA for ruining my (30f) boyfriend’s (30m) birthday?,"It was my boyfriend’s 30th and he’s not big on celebrating his birthday so we had a last minute reservation at a new restaurant which went ok. When we arrived back home I had flowers, cake and a present for him. I saved the present till last and the courier arrived with the flowers while we were out for dinner. When I gave him the flowers I got a little upset because he kept asking why I got him flowers instead of just saying thanks. He didn’t even read the card it came with. Nonetheless I bit my tongue and we had cake. All is well at this point. Before we went to bed I surprised him with a present which I really thought long and hard for because he’s really hard to buy anything for and if I ask him he’ll just tell me not to worry about it. To give you an idea, I had to refund his Christmas present because he didn’t dig the colourway of the shoes and it was black white and grey and my boyfriend’s wardrobe is all black white, grey and a hint of navy. But it’s his 30th this time and I didn’t want him to have nothing from me. I knew he needed a new wallet, we brought it up a few times over the year and he agrees. The wallet he currently has is falling apart and is kinda cheap. I wanted to give him something nicer. I shopped around for ages and found one that I think is similar style, size etc. Even stole his wallet when he slept so I could compare the two. But of course when I gave it to him, he refuses to have it because it’s expensive and he doesn’t see a point in owning a wallet that he’ll eventually destroy (due to his job). After hearing that I just got so upset and started picking a fight with him... on his birthday and without finishing the argument we went to bed. The next day he pretended like nothing happened but I was not finished so I kept going on and on about how he didn’t appreciate my effort. We were supposed to go on a road trip that weekend so that didn’t end up happening. Now he keeps saying I ruined his 30th birthday and That I haven’t apologised. I can see myself as being the butthole in this situation but I am also too butt hurt to believe it. So AITA?Edit: - flowers are a strange gift for a man. He did joke about me not getting him flowers not too long ago. I’m just following through a joke. It’s 2021, flowers shouldn’t be a gender biased gift.- He doesn’t hate gifts. He is just aware that he is very difficult to shop for.- dinner reservation was made last minute because bf made the decision last minute. It was made at a restaurant he chose. It was ‘ok’ because the food was shit and the bill was equivalent to eating good at a reputable $$$$ restaurant. - he is not big on birthdays meaning he doesn’t like throwing parties not that he wants zero celebration. That said, he even considered renting a space and getting catering for his 30th. His idea, not mine.- he did thank me for the cake and said it was delicious though (1 win I guess)"
4,2021-03-18 06:31:53,Everyone Sucks,14,m7b8sa,27,AITA for being upset when MIL gives gifts that are used?,"Necessary background: F(37), nuclear family in partner's home country (UK), my in-laws are British and live locally.Over a decade of marriage I've had a rocky relationship with my mother-in-law, there's been good times but also some nasty fights - I hear it's not too unusual not to see eye-to-eye with a MIL.Recently it's been going well, until MIL came around and brought me a nicely wrapped gift which turns out to be some fancy anti-aging shower cream. I have a look and notice it is not sealed, I double-check this online and I can see that what I've been given has at the very least was opened before (could have been used before).I find this upsetting, as it appears as if she is trying to pass off her unwanted cosmetics like they're brand new and to her it's be easier to use it as gift fodder rather than just throwing it away - in short, disrespectful. I confront my MIL about this over the phone, she states she was unaware that the gift wasn't sealed and that she bought it a long time ago - it seems she impulse buys a lot of duty free airport cosmetics and so has a lot to spare for random gifting purposes (MIL is retired and pre-Covid usually went on at least three trips abroad every year, all 1st class to do things such as go on Safari). This also isn't the first time I have received a gift that was a leftover from her collection, usually I am given something that's at least sealed and so is definitely untouched - maybe a little musty, but in mint-condition this time not so.Now MIL is upset that I was upset and the nearest I've had to an apology is ""I'm sorry you feel that way"".AITA for being upset by this habit of my MIL?"
5,2021-03-18 03:59:16,Everyone Sucks,13,m77s8k,30,AITA for wanting to call animal control on my neighbors,"So for context. Up until today I thought my husband had renewed the registration on our dog. Apparently he did not because covid.We live in a more rural area of our state. Houses aren’t right on top of each other. We can our neighbors houses but there is a nice wooded area that separates us. One of our neighbors has a dog. We have a dog. When we first moved in we noticed in spring and summer our neighbors dog would wonder from their house, to the woods and explore our yard. I would shoo it away. Mostly because I didn’t want it pooping in our yard. The neighbors seemed to notice the issue with the dog coming in the yard and I thought they had started putting their dog in their fenced backyard. For the last week their dog has been wondering into our yard again trying to potty. Usually it stays in the woods and i don’t really have a problem with that but our main yard is different. My husband went out today to shoo it away and the neighbors were outside! They clearly knew where their dog was and called him back, didn’t say sorry.I am pregnant and we have our own dog who is pretty protective. I told my husband this has been going on long enough and next time it’s in our yard im calling animal control. They have a fence in yard but specifically let it out of the yard so they dont have to pick up after it.My husband flipped out and said “dont you dare call the cops on the neighbors” i told him that im not okay with them using our woods and yard (we actually own the wooded area their dog had been using) for their dog to poop and pee in. Im not okay this dog had no sense of boundaries. And they clearly know it’s going in our yard and dont care. He says since our dog isn’t registered we need to not call the cops. Now we arent speaking.For reference: we could fence in our yard. However we own a big natural forest area. So we wouldn’t be able to enclose all of it. Most house in our neighborhood with a lot size that big dont fence then in. It’s apart of the rural living. Also i love the deer and foxes being able to cut through. Our neighbors have a giant fenced in yard. My main issue is if their dog is outside they need to watch it like we do our dog. We have debated fencing the yard in for other reasons. But i think $6k so a dog doesnt poop in our yard and stays in his is ridiculous. Im also concerned about the dog coming into the yard once we have kids (currently pregnant with 1st)."
6,2021-03-18 00:59:59,Everyone Sucks,20,m73n05,43,"AITA for overtaking a group project and ""ruining my peers' learning experience""?","Just like most people, I hate group projects in college. Not because I don't think that learning how to work as a team is valuable, but because they are needlessly complicated and the team members absolutely never put in an equal amount of work (either through ethic or ability), especially in an online format.So for this newest group project, I offered to do the whole thing. They still looked at the material and had to actually learn the info, but I did all the deliverables. And not even as some martyr-like ""I do ALL the work"" crusade, it is just truly easier and less work to do it myself rather than coordinate a bunch of teenagers, teach them effective time-management and communication, and figure out how to integrate five different writing styles and skills with often-subpar work. That is not my job as a student. Professors always assign group work, but they don't ever really teach you how to do it. And I totally get that this sounds cocky (and was called cocky) and I'm sure that this attitude will field me some YTAs.But anyway, I did the whole project. Everybody got an A and the other four group members were obviously very happy with the arrangement. It was all fine. Until the peer-review process. Now again, this was my idea made purely out of selfish reasons, so it's not like I'm going to complain on the review process that my team didn't do any work. So it was basically just four different ways of saying ""they contributed as efficiently as possible to the benefit of the group"". Evidently, the professor did not agree. And is looking into academic integrity action. But again, professors give out group projects with no info, no guidelines, and just expect everyone to solve it. So I solved it, which is what I told her. I was told that this is ""cocky asshole"" behavior and the titled claim that I was ruining learning experiences. So, AITA?"
7,2021-03-16 22:26:11,Everyone Sucks,2464,m690iy,805,AITA for insulting a fat girl after she told me to eat a burger?,"We’re both 17f for context.Basically, someone in my friend group at school, who I’ll call Jenny, is pretty overweight, and clearly insecure about it, whereas the rest of the group are all slim. I have never mentioned weight, calories, health etc in front of her bc i know she’s insecure. She has a habit of implying that we’re all too skinny (in what feels like a disparaging way), but we tend to ignore her.But one time at lunchtime I wasn’t hungry so didn’t eat anything, and I swear she was giving me dirty looks the whole time, then said ‘you should really start eating more’ to me. To clarify, it was obvious she was saying it to be insulting, not because she cared about my health or anything (I normally eat loads). So anyway, I was annoyed at this comment, and said ‘what and start to look like you? No thanks’Then, she walked out, and was very upset.Objectively, I accept that what I said was very mean, and my friends think i was in the wrong. One of them said that it would’ve been fine if i’d told jenny to eat a salad or something that was a direct inversion of what she said, but since I expressly insulted the way Jenny looks, I’m in the wrong. I see what they mean, especially since I know she’s insecure.However, i was just sick of her taking her insecurities out on me and my friends. It’s not like I cant be insecure either - ive always felt too ‘flat’ so its not really fun when she  implies that i’m too skinny. Just want to know if I was justifies in what I said to her, or AITA?"
8,2021-03-17 17:06:07,Everyone Sucks,62,m6vdau,63,AITA for forgetting to vacuum on my days causing my aunt to give my sister (25f) and me (23f) an ultimatum that we have a week to make it consistent or we need to pay rent?," I (23F) and my sister (25F) live with our aunt. She invited us a while back to live with her under the amazingly generous conditions that we either work or study and keep the place tidy. Of course we said yes and I am currently studying and working part-time while my sister is studying full-time (both distance). The problem with the tidying part is I have severe ADHD, I have a tendency to leave things around that I then forget and lose track of time a lot. I am working really hard on improving and have just started a new medication that I am hoping will make a difference. My aunt is understanding of this and is not as pushy on me since she knows I am struggling.I have tried compensating by cooking. I really enjoy cooking and have a delicious meal for aunt to eat whenever she comes home from work. She really appreciates this since she does not like cooking (or have the time) and neither does my sister, who will come out from her room when she smells that food is done. Since I cook so much I do the grocery shopping, which keeps the fridge stocked and aunt does not have to potentially expose herself to the virus anymore. Aunt gave a suggestion that since I always have meals ready and keep the fridge stocked, my sister can do the vacuuming. My sister did not like this and said that that is not fair since she will be cooking too and it is better if we divide the days in the week where we vacuum instead. It has been 6 months now and she has not cooked anything besides her own breakfast. And I have been struggling to remember to vacuum on my days. Eventually my aunt sat down with us and said that the vacuuming has not gone well at all, and if we don’t fix this soon we will need to start paying rent. My sister got very flustered and said that she would do the vacuuming alone, since it is easier to do it without having to think of me. When my aunt left for work my sister tore into me saying that this would not have happened if I had done my days. That this was mostly my fault and I need to take responsibility for it. I looked at the list and saw that many of her days were not ticked off either and said If that was the case then aunt would have sat down with just me to have this talk. My sister got very emotional and left glaring. I followed and said that it was very mean of her to put all the blame on me. She said that the only reason why I cook is because I enjoy it, if I didnt I would NEVER do it. I need to learn about reality, that I need to learn to do things I don’t like and it is very childish of me to only be doing things that I want, that I need to grow up.I stood my ground and glared at her, telling her that it is both our fault and that it was a very reasonable thing for aunt to say. My sister was shaking and got teary eyed and demanded I leave her alone.Part of my ADHD is that I am very hyper emotional. I feel awful. I don’t know if it really is my fault and it was unfair towards my sister and I need to take responsibility alone. Reddit, AITA?"
9,2021-03-17 13:48:06,Everyone Sucks,58,m6sgst,55,AITA for expecting my boyfriend to watch my shows like we watch his shows?,"My (22F) boyfriend (24M) and I are long distance and the border between our countries is closed due to covid and has been for the last year. We used to play video games together but he has stopped playing any game except for WoW so we don’t play together anymore and we usually facetime and watch tv shows together. We switch off who chooses which show to watch (I chose Merlin, then he chose demon slayer, etc.). Well when we are watching his shows he is always calling wanting to watch for hours and hours and we get through his shows very quickly. He always has us stay up until like 2am and gets super excited. When we watch my shows, he seems excited but will end it after a couple episodes and say he has to go do something or he’s falling asleep. He says that watching shows in his bed with the lights off makes him sleepy but when we were watching demon slayer he never had that problem. I always have to call him now whereas before he often called me wanting to watch. He always says “don’t worry we’ll watch a lot on my next day off” but he uses his days off to do other things so we barely talk.Right now we’re watching adventure time where the episodes are only 12 mins long. 2 nights ago he had a day off the next day (so no bedtime) so I called him and asked him if his light was on so he wouldn’t fall asleep. He said it was. I requested it video call him to see if it was and it wasn’t. Then he did something to make it look like his light was on so I asked him to show me the light source and he was like “fine I’ll turn the light on”. I basically was on his ass all night and got him to watch 7 episodes, less than an hour and a half of the show, but he kept pointing to the fact that we had watched so many episodes and asking how could I want more.Tonight I got him to watch 4 episodes, so basically an hour, but he only wanted to watch 3.  We stopped at 11:45 pm (remember he would have us stay up to 2:00am when we were watching his show). He said that it’s not his fault he has to go do the dishes and that he has work tomorrow. I said “if you knew you had to leave this early why didn’t you call me before and why’d you wait for me to call you?” He said he wants me to call him at 11:00pm so that I can stop him from playing WoW because he can’t stop on his own. He gets home from work at around 7 or 8? So I guess he plans to spend 3-4 hours playing WoW and then 1 hour watching adventure time with me.This has basically been an ongoing fight since we started watching a week ago and he‘s upset that I’m “always mad at him” even though we are watching so many episodes every night. AITA for being mad that he basically is scheduling 1 hour for me a day? Is it unreasonable for me to expect more? It’s also annoying knowing that if I never called him then we would basically never talk. I guess he would call me before bed hopefully."
10,2021-03-17 22:43:58,Everyone Sucks,8,m70pms,23,AITA for getting mad at my friend?,"So there’s me( 16),my friend “grace” and this other group of girls involved. Obviously, we are all in high school. For the past few weeks i have had drama with the group of girls due to something that we disagree on. It involves a lot of the “high school” stereotypes of drama, eg talking crap and all that. So, I was out of school for a few days and in this time the group of girls decided to talk crap about me in class, mocking things i posted, talking about their opinion on this situation. My friend, grace, is in a few of their classes and was listening to everything they were saying because they weren’t being very quiet at all. Well a few days ago, she texted me and told me i should just “stop posting shit”. This was in retaliation to me posting a few things about the situation on my snapchat story. Essentially she started attacking me and saying I am in the wrong, however these girls have sent me videos of them mocking things I post, have insulted the way I look, and have even threatened me. I asked grace if she even knew both sides of the story and she said “I have ears so I can hear what they say in class”. Obviously this means she only knows their side of the story and not mine. She had no idea about the cyber bullying or anything. When I told her about it, she said that “well, you’re posting stuff so that’s cyber bullying as well”. All I posted was one thing saying “imagine mocking someone for the way they look and talking crap about them when they’re not even there to hear it”. That is on no way cyber bullying, and if it is it’s to no extent the same way they have been cyber bullying me. Grace kept going on about how she’s coming to me as a “friend” and just trying to give me advice and help me. She refused to listen to my side of the situation. So i told her that she “needs to butt her nose out of a situation she knows nothing about, and that if she was a friend she would listen to my side of the story without attacking me first.”. She continued to talk about it, after i asked her to stop. I also said that I hope she is glad that she has lost a friendship of over 5 years just because she refused to listen to my side and continued to defend the group. AITA for saying this and reacting this way?EDIT: Grace had drama last year that I talked about and she asked me to stop, so I did. However, she did not do the same when i asked her to.EDIT 2: They were mocking tik tok videos i posted and photos of me ok my instagram."
11,2021-03-17 16:52:09,Everyone Sucks,10,m6v64k,39,AITA for asking my brother to not shout at me when I make a mistake?,"I don’t have the best memory I am prone to forgetting things and messing up sometimes. But lately, whenever I make a small mistake, my brother will get really mad and shout at me to do what I’ve forgotten. I’m autistic, so being shouted at is really awful for me and I find it really demeaning and upsetting. The thing is, I know I messed up. I know that I made a mistake and that I need to fix it. But if he would just ask me nicely without raising his voice and saying ‘please’ or ‘thank you’ I’d happily do it, no questions asked.I mentioned this to my mother in the hopes she’d bring it up to him later as a ‘third person mediation’ thing, but INSTEAD, she brought it up to him at the dinner table in front of me and Dad. Of course, my brother proceeded to look at me like I just shot his dog, full fish mouth for a good few minutes. So, I told him, politely mind you how I felt…that I didn’t like him being rude to me, and if he needs me to do something, to ask me nicely and I’d happily do it. But he instead said ‘oh well you keep on forgetting to do this and I asked you nicely then…’ but that missed the point of what I wanted.I tried to say that I understand what I did wrong and that I’ll try to be better but being rude was just going to piss me off and make me not want to do it. But then my brother Mum and Dad all ganged up on me and kept berating me for my mistakes and making excuses for my brother. I got so mad that I wasn’t being listened to that I did something extremely petty because when I get mad, I get petty as a quick grab for power. So, I took my brother's water glass and downed the whole thing. And of course, my brother mum and dad all called me pathetic disgusting again and Dad said ‘You’re 20, you should take responsibility’ although my brother who’s 18 doesn’t have to take responsibility for his rudeness. So, I had enough, I took my dinner plate and went off to my room, where I am writing this now eating my chicken casserole.I asked my sister what she thought, and she was sympathetic, saying that that’s just the way they are and it’s best to move past it. But I’m still mad, because I already came clean and confessed to my mistakes, but they wouldn’t let them go because they wanted to excuse my brother.I even said “If you wouldn’t treat a retail worker like that, then don’t treat me like that. Or you would treat a retail worker like that, then you’re a horrible person.”I am the asshole for standing up for myself?\*Edit\* Sorry for being vague about my mistakes, the mistake that set this in motion was, I put my dirty mug into the sink instead of into the dishwasher, and other times I've forgotten to scrub the toilet bowl if I left any stains"
12,2021-03-17 03:42:41,Everyone Sucks,78,m6g4ck,33,"AITA for refusing to answer a question, because I knew where it was gonna lead.","So I just wanted to know if I was rude or the asshole in a conversation a friend and I had a few days ago. We were driving around and I started talking about my brakes needing to be checked/changed. They ask when was the last time I got it changed, I answer NOV/2019. They say that my brakes should have been checked with my last oil change. I say that I’ve never heard of that being the norm, and that maybe she was getting the hook up. She insists that your brakes get checked during oil changes, and then asked where I go to service my car. I said that I knew what she was gonna respond with, so I didn’t want to answer. She asks a few more times, and then flips the question to if I got my dealer for servicing. I say no I don’t go to my dealer then she mumbles “that’s probably why” which I knew she was gonna respond with, no matter what I said. But later on she told me that I was rude for saying that I didn’t want to hear what she had to say. AITA or was I rude for what I said?"
13,2021-03-16 01:11:52,Everyone Sucks,9476,m5o6lo,2477,AiTA for evicting my son and his pregnant girlfriend because he wants his real dad and not me?,"When my son was 10, I caught my wife cheating and got a divorce. I tested all my childreb and 3 were mine, but my oldest 10yo son was not. I was mad, but.eventually got over it and did not want to trwat him separately than his siblings at first. Unfortunately, his mom told him about his biodad against our agreement and at 18 he started regularly calling and speaking to him. Well he 20 now and he got a girl pregnant. Since she had no where to stay, i decided to let her move in with my son so they could continue going to college while raising their kid. Well, my son's relationship with his biodad really took off i guess. The emotions and.everything all came to a head recently at the childs babyshower wherein he gifted his biodad a shirt that said grandpa on it. Moreover he has started occasionally calling me by my first name even in front of our other kids. He has sort of made it clear to me that biology is more important than the man who raised him. So instead of giving them a gift on the babyshower i quickly drew up a 30 day eviction notice after a quick call with my attorney and replaced my present with that. Im just tired of the disrespect... but apparently he did not see it coming because he was competely blind sided. I should also add that i have overheard him saying other things like ""my real dad was a marine"" and stuff when he thinks im not home. I told him to go live at his real dads house if he wanted. The only reason he doesnt live there now is because its a single bedroom apartment. I am also going to stop paying his tuition next semester and just kind of cut him off completely.  AITA for evicting my son and his pregnant girlfriend because he doesn't think of me as a dad anymore?"
14,2021-03-16 23:56:00,Everyone Sucks,75,m6awd9,121,AITA For Making A Joke About My Sisters Period?,"So I (21 M) and my sister (18 F) were at my dads the other weekend and on my way there I began feeling stomach pain. I pulled over at my mothers and wound up stuck in the bathroom for roughly 3 hours in pain from my stomach and lower pelvic region. I'm not sure what the problem was but needless to say without too much detail it was very painful cramps and blood leaking. My dad being a great dad drove the hour to come get me so i didn't have to drive in that pain especially because i was freaking out.I was in bed for roughly 3 days still in pain. I could get up and move but i didnt feel sociable and didnt have a appetite. Never saw a doctor (probably should have but whatever im not dead) my dad's Wife made a joke when I was telling everyone about what was happening that it sounded like I was getting a Period witch we all laughed at. Based on my limited knowledge she's not wrong. Well after the 3 days i felt a lot better and actually got up to hang with my family. And that's when my sister's time hit her.My sister is known for being in a very bad mood during her time and has become known for yelling, screaming and demanding things. This is because my mother taught her word for word “women can't be blamed for their actions during their time of the month” so while me and my dad were talking about politics (his favorite topic) she came in and after a minute or 2 demanded we change the topic because she doesn't like talking about that. So I made a joke along the lines of “funny how you can't handle the pain of your period but i could. Guess I'm a tougher woman than you.” my dad and his wife thought it was funny, she did not, she blew up and began yelling that i don't know what a real period is like. I argued that being a guy going through it was more scary due to the fact that it shouldn't be happening. She got mad and stormed off and didn't talk to me the rest of the visit.My dad and his wife are on my side that she needs to apologize and stop being so entitled just cause she's in pain. My Mother is refusing to talk to me until I make an apology to my sister for upsetting her. My dad keeps telling me i'm not at fault but my mother and a few female friends say I am so I want a unbiased opinion.Edit to make it clear. I'm not saying I had a Period. My Dad's wife is the one who compared it to having one. Her being a 30+ (lowballing idk her age) woman I figured would know if it's comparable or not. I am not saying I had one. I want that to be clear. I only compared them because an older woman compared them and I trust her judgment as a woman. As for the people saying to seek medical attention. If it had gotten worse I would have and my dad did offer but I told him I would be fine. If it comes back i definitely will but i am not worried about it. However seeing all of you saying I should dose make me smile. "
15,2021-03-17 09:30:31,Everyone Sucks,10,m6nofx,7,AITA for stop talking to my sister,"My sister (20) and I (28) still live in our parents' house (that's kind of frequent and socially acceptable in our country). We've been pretty close all of our lives, but she's always had a bad attitude that I've sporadically found very hard to deal with. To be brief, I'll say that she's extremely negative, often trying to put down everyone that is in a good mood.In December, I had a couple of weeks off, which I decided to spend reading in our garden, which I enjoyed a lot, since traveling in the middle of the pandemic wasn't a good idea. I told her that and she started a particularly aggressive rant about how my reading stopped her from spending time in the garden. The argument triggered my depression and I ended up spending my long-waited vacation alone in my room, lying in the dark. During that time, she didn't spend a second in the garden.When I recovered, I briefly talked to her about how I suffer from depression, which I haven't told anyone else in my family, and how her negativity was more than I could deal with. Since then, I stopped talking to her, except for the strictly necessary or the sporadic comment on a group conversation.My mom tells me she's very lonely and the change in our relationship has hit her hard, but I just can't deal with someone that makes active efforts for stopping other people's joy. Am I the asshole?"
16,2021-03-17 10:13:21,Everyone Sucks,6,m6oi70,14,AITA For How I Act Around My Brother?,"So to preface this I want to say that the example I’m using is just one instance of stuff like this happening and, believe me, it happens a lot. My (older) brother and I still live together in my parents house so that’s why stuff like this can happen so often. Anyways, into the story.So this happened a couple of days ago but it got me thinking about if my brother is the asshole or if I am. We both recently were able to get PS5’s and since I’m not very technologically adept, he’s been helping me transfer my data from my PS4 so that we can then trade them in and get credit for them (which has happened at this point). So after I transferred the last game from my PS4 that I wanted, he was helping me factory reset my PS4, which isn’t required but we wanted to do it. While that was going on, he was gathering the things I would need to trade in song with the actual PS4. Such as wires, chargers, and the controller that I had. When he went to go get the controller and unplug it since I was charging it at the time, this conversation followed:Brother: “you see how this controller charging port is almost broken? That’s because you’re yanking the plug out every time you unplug the controller. Don’t do that.”Me: “okay, sorry” I thought that that would suffice but he continues and says in an annoying tone,B: “I’ve told you multiple times not to do this and you always do it, are you dumb?”Me: “I said sorry, I just always forget because I’m not paying attention”B: “Yeah well you see how it’s almost broken? You see? It’s almost broken.”Him continuing to talk to me in a degrading tone and him repeating himself caused me to get very irritated. So I snapped at him and told him to shut up because I heard him the first time, and I’ll try to stop doing it. He said that I was overreacting and being an immature baby. Here’s the thing, he does stuff like this ALL THE TIME, and I am so fed up with it. He will take any chance he gets to degrade me and make me feel like I’m stupid. He always just says he’s trying to help me, and I don’t know if that’s true, but if it is, he’s not very good at it. And on top of that, moving away from this specific instance, he’s just always immature and is specifically trying to annoy me because he thinks it’s funny. Like for example, he mocks me a lot for no reason. He will just take anything I say, put his voice up in pitch, and repeat back to me what I say. There’s no purpose of this other than to annoy me. And finally, he also calls me derogatory slurs “as a joke” even though he knows that I am gay. But then, he’ll have the audacity to try and say I’m the immature one, and I overreact to what he’s doing. The problem is that he never stops, even when I ask politely and try to just avoid conflict. Now, I’ll admit that sometimes my reactions can be over the top but that’s usually AFTER, he’s already pushed me by being annoying on purpose, or implying that I’m stupid. So am I really the asshole here?"
17,2021-03-16 18:58:48,Everyone Sucks,99,m65jck,110,AITA for responding this way to husband swearing at me?,"Am I the asshole here??Husband and I got into argument during workday (both wfh). He got annoyed and escalated things when he said “shut the fuck up”. I totally lost it when he took the argument there and I responded by swearing right back.Now he is saying I’m in the wrong just as much as him. Here’s the thing, I’m 4 months pregnant with second child. This is now the second time he’s cursed at me during an argument and we had a huge fight about it the first time. Naturally he apologized but here we are a few months later and same thing happened.I get I shouldn’t have reacted like that, but honestly I’m pregnant and full of hormones. Its hits me a lot differently when I’m pregnant (second time he’s done this). This just feels and hits me so much harder that he is ok saying things like that to his pregnant wife. And then I’m to collect myself and go back to my demanding job (he has a more lax low pressure job so prob not as hard to collect himself).It’s like he’s trying to excuse his behavior. If he didn’t escalate the fight there, I never would have got to that level. But of course now I’m in the wrong just as much according to him.Am I the asshole here??!"
18,2021-03-17 03:54:43,Everyone Sucks,18,m6gegd,16,AITA for not wanting to speak with my friend who ruined our housing plans for university?,"For context, me (M19) and my friend (M18) have known each other for ten years and we happened to get into the same university. We come from different backgrounds, with his parents being quite wealthy, and mine struggling financially because of nasty three-year divorce period. For the sake of privacy, I will refer to him as 'John.' John's parents can pay for his education out of pocket, while mine do not want to support me and have told me to take loans and pay tuition using my own money.In December 2020, John and I finally sat down and began to plan to look for housing in where we were going to school, and decided to rent a space that was close to campus. I told him that I would need to bring in some friends or people I met to live with us because of financial constraints. With the rent being around $2300, I figured that splitting it with at least one or two more people would save me a lot of money. At the time, he seemed fine with it and we even started to discuss a rotating schedule for all of us at this residence, but maybe I should have asked how he felt about living with strangers instead of forcing this decision upon him.About three weeks ago, John messaged me and told me to sign up for housing so that we would secure our chances of getting the best apartments. I hopped in call with him and discover that he signed up for a single bedroom apartment. All our planning and efforts had seemingly gone to waste.  I asked him why he looked for housing without me. John said his dad told him to. I didn't believe that because his father knew that we were going to live together and our families are on good terms. After that call I just didn't feel like talking to John for a little while. Now, I had to look for affordable housing on my own and search for additional roommates to live with in order to try and bring down the cost to around $400-$500 a month instead of paying $1100+ a month.My mom somehow knew something was up and I told her about what had happened. She talked to John's mom and confirmed that his father had told him to sign up for housing, **but** consult me in this process. That gave me less of a reason to want to try and clear things up with John. He also told his mom that he was angry at me for wanting to live with more people when he thought that it was just going to be the two of us. He said this in spite of knowing my financial situation and could have communicated this to me earlier if he didn't want to live with other people. This also seemed to contradict with his actions just a few months ago, when he didn't have any issue with me bringing in other friends/roommates.To sum it up, John thinks that I'm in the wrong for bringing in outsiders to live with us, while I think he's in the wrong for not communicating clearly with me. He and I haven't talked to each other since this happened."
19,2021-03-17 08:53:07,Everyone Sucks,2,m6my78,13,AITA for being mad at my friend?,"I'm used to talk shit about my new classmates with this friend of mine, but just for the funs, I know I'm the asshole in that situation. This friend repeatedly asked for their numbers so he could do a joke and then apologize but once he started to have a long conversation with this classmate I don't know and suddenly, just joking around not sure why, he send this classmate a screenshot of me joking around about him. Classmate talked to me and he wasn't angry and we don't have problems, but why I'm angry is because my friend showed the screenshot of our conversation without my permission, and it's not the first time he's been revealing stuff of our relationship with friends in common. It's okay to be angry about that? I'm just exaggerating? :c"
20,2021-03-16 18:45:11,Everyone Sucks,18,m65cda,17,AITA for telling my close friend not to comment on my family matters?,"First of bit of context, I'm Australian, so some of the wording and slang used may confuse you and be interpreted differently. The situation: Me and my close friend (both 30f) were having a conversation over messenger about the footy and who we were tipping (betting) on, I said who I had tipped and she made a comment that my BIL (brother in law) would not be happy because I didnt tip his team. (She used to live in a share house with my BIL so they are close friends aswell) I reply back  ""BIL can suck it (in relation to his footy team.) I actually haven't seen him since Xmas he hasn't seen his neices since Xmas and never bloody replies to me either! Haha"" Her response to that was a long tangent about how he has depression and saying i haven't made effort to see him and really digging in that I don't care about him My response : seriously, get fucked. I'm not having a conversation with you about this,  this isn't just a friend this is my family and I don't want to converse about this with you as it runs alot deeper then you know and you don't know all the information to make comment on my efforts.Her response : how matureMy response: we aren't talking about it anymore She then has told my BIL what I've said, but made up some crap in between which resulted in myself and him getting into a fight because he took her side, but I managed to get him to come over and see me face to face and I showed him the conversation and cleared it up. I've also apologised to my friend for the slight overreaction but in my apology I also said I don't want to discuss my BIL or other family matter with her, as I know she went back and told him things and she has broken my trust but I don't want it to ruin the friendship so I was happy to leave it as that and move on and forget the whole thing even happened Its been 5 days, she has ignored all my calls and messegers and I've known she's seen them. I'm beginning to think I am the asshole?"
21,2021-03-17 02:32:49,Everyone Sucks,3,m6eid4,36,AITA for converting a pedal bike to a 2 stroke motorized bike?,"Hi all,I was going to build an electric bike this summer cause the conversion kits are relatively cheap. Upon further research, I realized I would also need to buy a battery that could cost upwards of $200. If you've worked with LiPos before, you know that you have to maintain them (can't leave them charged or discharged for long periods of time -- and you have to store them at a certain voltage in order to prolong the life span), and they can be a fire hazard. I also talked to some people online and they indicated that they were having to renew their batteries every year. This quickly adds up and I decided it was too much money for me. I found online a 80cc 2 stroke motor kit for a bicycle, and decided to buy that instead for $140. The nice thing is gas is cheap and readily available, and it will always be ready for me to ride. I don't need to worry about discharging or charging the battery to storage voltage, and all I have to do is fill a tank vs. wait around for a battery to slowly charge. Obviously one downside is the noise of it, and the smell (2 stroke gas can be smelly. I personally like it but some people find it offensive). I got my kit and installed it and was ripping around the neighborhood. A few neighbors were giving me dirty looks or would turn around, appearing to look startled (probably from the noise) as I passed them. Since it was a new motor, the carb needed some tuning and I need to run a higher oil mix with the gas to break it in, so it's a lot smokier than normal. I ripped around for probably 5 hours on Saturday, making small adjustments and tying to break it in -- I was having a blast. The next morning I woke up and was going to go outside to rip around again. My tires on my truck that was parked in the driveway were slashed, and there was a note in my mailbox that said to ""slow down in the neighborhood, there are fucking kids playing!"" I was a little confused -- the bike only does about 30 mph and I was going well under that when riding in residential areas (probably closer to 20). Yeah the bike is kind of loud, but I assure you that the bike *sounds* a lot faster than it really is. Now I'm afraid to even be seen on it! AITA for riding around on my new bike? I don't want to get rid of it, it's really fun."
22,2021-03-15 09:14:15,Everyone Sucks,3731,m584ne,308,AITA for calling my cousin-in-law a bitter cow because her daughter wasn’t the first great-grandchild anymore?,"My cousin-in-law “Stella” has been obsessed with having the first great-grandchild in our family ever since she married my cousin 5 years ago. When her daughter was born, she was constantly going on and on about how she was my grandfather’s first great-grandchild and how her daughter was the family legacy. It was annoying but her daughter is adorable, so we all sucked it up and humoured her.Well, 3 months ago my older brother, who is my grandfather’s golden boy, found out he had a son. Without going into too much detail, my brother met “Kiera” while he was at a very low point in his life and was taking a ‘break’ (i.e. hiding away) from life/our family. He gave her a fake backstory and name so when he left, she had no way to contact him to let him know she was pregnant. It took her until 3 months ago to finally get in touch with him.This has caused a whole scandal in my family because my brother is the last person anyone would think would accidentally father a child. My cousins all though this would knock him off the golden boy pedestal, but my grandfather was worried my brother would never have kids, so this has had the opposite effect. From what my cousin/Stella's SIL has told me, Stella was fuming when she found out because my nephew is 2 months older than her daughter. Making him the 'first' great grandchild.My brother is trying to convince Kiera to relocate to our city so when she brought their son so our family could meet him, we were all on our best behaviour. Stella hated it. She kept complaining everyone was treating my nephew better than they had ever treated her daughter and she started accusing my grandfather of being misogynistic. After the third day of her complaining, I told her to stop being a bitter cow because her daughter was no longer the first great-grandchild.She’s since told everyone what I said, and my aunt scolded me for being insensitive and basically made this whole thing about Stella and how hard this was for her. My cousin also sent me a long message which essentially said I was an insensitive AH.AITA?"
