0,2021-03-18 08:03:09,Asshole,770,m7d6xr,334,AITA For asking my wife to buy the same dress our neighbor's wife was wearing?,"Throwaway for privacy.Me M37 and My wife F31moved into our neighborhood 4 years ago. Everyone around here very kind and friendly. Obviously we've established a close relationship with most neighbors. We'd attend events together. Visit each others and stay in touch. Every friday night we'd get together for dinner. Me and my wife regularly attend and do some activities like board games etc.We recently had a new family move in to the neighborhood. It's a young family of 3. They're very polite and friendly. I heard from the other neighbors that they new neighbors will start attending our events.My wife and I hosted last friday's get together. The new neighbors showed up. So did the rest.Anyways. After dinner I complimented my new neighbor's wife's dress. I looked at my wife and told her that I really liked it and she should get a similar one since it looked great. My wife gave me a look and everyone stared at me for a minute. I honestly had no idea who was hurt by what I said amd wether it was wrong or not.My wife kept quiet til everyone left. She then blew up. I asked why and she responded by asking if I'm really that dense or pretending to be. She argued with me about my inappropriate comment on my neighbor's wife dress and how embarrassed she was by me telling her to get an similar one since I ""liked"" it. I told her she was overreacting but she kept saying what I said was awful and made her feel aweful besides making the lady feel uncomfortable.I called her unreasonable then went upstairs. She's been giving the cold shoulder eversince despite saying sorry if I said anything that hurt her."
1,2021-03-18 00:46:24,Asshole,1995,m73ceg,959,AITA for taking down pictures from a wall collage my daughter was making?,"My older daughter Heather(15) doesn’t like her sister Olivia(5) due to the age gap. My husband and I have tried everything to get them to bond, especially since Olivia looks up to her big sister. But nothing is working and Heather just wants to stay away from her sister and for her sister to stay away from her.It was Olivia’s birthday yesterday, but since it was a school day and because of the pandemic, we couldn’t give her a party. Instead, just a cake and family dinner. Heather participated without any hiccups, and then went to her room to make her wall collage. Olivia wanted to play with her sister and went into her room. Heather was taping some pictures to her wall and Olivia wanted to help. Heather reluctantly let her tape a couple of the pictures on the wall but when Olivia started to accidentally crumple a couple of the paper cutouts Heather was taping to her wall, she yelled at her sister to go away and stop ruining her stuff.I wasn’t too far away so I knew what the girls were doing. I immediately went to scold Heather for being mean to her sister on her birthday. She told me that I always turned a blind eye to her sister encroaching upon her personal space and that she was done pampering the baby, who isn’t even a baby anymore. I told Heather family doesn’t have boundaries and that she had to be nicer to her sister, who only wanted her love and affection. Heather rolled her eyes and said she never asked for such a large age gap. I told her that her paper cutouts were temporary, but family is forever. My husband and I tried to make the rest of Olivia’s birthday a good one, and we took down Heather’s pictures from her wall collage as punishment. But was that an AH move? We know Heather is just an angsty teen, but we’ve had enough with the way she treats her sister.EDIT: I had to step away for a while to work but saw all the comments. I can’t reply to each one individually but I’ll clarify that1. Heather and Olivia are full siblings, my husband and I are their bio parents2. You’re all overreaching and reading too much into my sentiment about family having no boundaries by implying sexual abuse from family members and watching each other showed and change. I only meant that doors shouldn’t be locked because we don’t lock each other out, we include each other and there shouldn’t be secrets and shutting off. If you’re a member of the family, act like it."
2,2021-03-18 07:24:47,Asshole,79,m7ce1x,172,AITA for telling my college grad kid to get a job?,"I'm in my 60s and I am a teacher and my husband is 64 and does not work. We have 2 kids. One recently graduated and has no job. She doesn't even have any motivation to look and my husband (her dad) and I have given her a month to look for a job.I personally just want her to get any job with benefits that allows her to move out and my husband wants the same thing, but he wants her to get a job in her field.My husband and I are very irritated that she hasn't done anything and doesn't even try to look. We don't want her to stay at home forever, and we don't make that much money. My husband also has heart problems and his prognosis is not good. I've tried to get my college grad kid to do something by bringing it up at least once a day and asking her what she's done jobs-wise, and I've warned my younger kid that she may have to support her sister in the future.My kid told me to give her a break and to stop being extreme, but I am not. She is 22 and needs to get a job. AITA? I am just so frustrated.I am actually nicer than her dad. Her dad wants to kick her out but I own the house, so my 22 year old will get to live here."
3,2021-03-18 02:51:46,Asshole,142,m767wo,242,AITA for eating the food my mom put on the porch for delivery drivers?,"I, 23M, live at home with my parents while college is still virtual. I don't have a job, so I am supported by them when it comes to food and stuff. For quite a few months, my parents, specifically my mom, has been putting snacks and drinks out on the porch for UPS/USPS/Fedex drivers because she saw someone on the internet do it.The problem with this is that what she puts on the porch is way nicer than what she buys for me and my sister to have around the house. For example, I've seen cans of soda, energy drinks, candy bars, little pringles cans, etc. We don't get anything like this bought for us. One day when I was looking for something to eat and could not find anything that sounded good, I remembered all the stuff on the porch and decided that it wouldn't hurt to grab a drink and a snack. Ever since then, I would occasionally grab something when I was really craving it. I guess my mom noticed that the stash was getting emptied at a faster rate than usual and she confronted me and my sister about it. I wasn't going to lie because I knew she probably already had proof it was me, so I admitted to taking food. She got mad and asked why I would take those snacks when we already had stuff in the house, and I tried to explain that I didn't like what we had inside but she wouldn't hear it. She is trying to guilt trip me now because she told me she was going to stop putting stuff out for drivers because of me. I don't think this is fair at all to me. Am I the asshole here?"
4,2021-03-17 23:56:18,Asshole,191,m728f1,139,AITA for wanting my husband to meal prep before his trip?,"My husband is going away on a week long trip. It will be his first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over his half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.Cooking is normally my husband's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my husband knows their preferences better than I do because he's cooked more. Thus, I asked him to prep dinners for the week that he will be gone to make it easier on me. He got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of him and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask him to do this since he's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?tldr My husband is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep"
5,2021-03-18 04:52:42,Asshole,68,m790do,83,AITA for refusing to talk about some topics with my brother/gf and in general?,"I (26M) have been having this argument lately both with my girlfriend and brother who are both similar ages to me. They're the people I see the most since we don't really socialize much these days but they say this is more like an ""asshole quality"" rather than a single instance and think I need to work on it for other people as well (??)Basically my girlfriend loves ghosts and monster and wacky lore. She says she knows they aren't real but she watches documentaries and reads books and listens to podcasts about supernatural stuff all the time and then tries to tell me about them. Sometimes she tries to make me respond and asks things like ""what if reincarnation could be real, what would you think you did in a past life"" or ""some people say there is a sea creature living in the town lake and let's have a picnic to go monster spotting there"" (just recent examples but there's so much more) and I just tell her that I am intentionally not responding because the whole topic is stupid and I don't want to encourage it. It's fine if she wants to think about it by herself but don't drag me into it because it's weird to me. I ask her to pause or stop those things when we are in the same room because I just hate it. Then sometimes she gets mad because she feels like I am making fun of her but I am not I am just not interested in responding to that stuff that is honestly delusionalMy brother also gets mad me for not talking. He teaches at a university and has way more education than me. Sometimes when we kick back he says things like ""I saw the coolest paper yesterday"" and tries to explain it but it is all nonsense to me so I shut it down and say I don't want to talk about his work. It's not something I can understand. No hate and I'm sure he finds it interesting but it makes me feel like I'm in a class trying to study. He said it's kind of rude if I can talk about work but he can't but it's different because I literally just a cook at a common restaurant and everyone understands concepts like food and social interactions. It isn't like I'm saying things to make him feel stupid like he makes me feel. Anyway they both say that people aren't allowed to ""veto"" topics of conversation and it makes me an AH if I just refuse to respond to some stuff sometimes. I disagree because you shouldn't be forced to talk about stuff that doesn't interest you. Nobody should. I don't think I'd mind if they did it to me either What do you all think?"
6,2021-03-18 04:56:53,Asshole,29,m793mc,83,WIBTA to ask our neighbor to watch her language in earshot of my kids? After she ignored my wife trying to ask.,"I own a house that is next to a duplex where the neighbor rents it out to tenants. This year, a young lady moved into the side beside my house. There is also a balcony out back that overlooks our backyard which otherwise has privacy by a tall privacy fence.Usually during warm weather my family spends a lot of time outdoors, we encourage the kids play in the yard. During the autumn and winter we didn't see much of her but in the Spring she has been working from home every day from the balcony. She seems to be in some kind of tech / programming job, from the backyard we can hear all her meetings.Anyway, she and her co-workers cuss a lot, not exactly in an angry way but it seems like the way they talk shop. Anyway, a lot of cussing about their customers, saying crude stuff about clients they seem frustrated with. Lots of bad language towards her co-workers too, even though it does seem like good natured shit talking it is still not stuff that we like hearing over lunch or dinner if we eat outside, and not stuff we like our kids hearing.And when she listens to music between meetings some of it has profanity.She's out on the balcony working everyday starting at 10 or 11 am and ending at 6 or 7 pm. This is a time the kids are often outside, we are homeschooling this year and we prefer evening lessons so they can get outside and play and excercise in the day There was one time my wife walked up next to her balcony and tried to talk to her and she put her hand up in the ""I'm on a call"" phone gesture and basically turned away. There was another time my wife went to her house and rang the bell when she was home and she didn't answer. WIBTA to go to her house and ask her to watch her language if she is outside when our kids are in earshot? She has ignored my wife but I'm generally more direct than my wife who walked away easily."
7,2021-03-17 05:54:28,Asshole,1578,m6j5fn,599,AITA for being upset my wife didn’t take care of me while I was drunk?,So one dumb day I drank so much I blacked out. The last thing I recall is being at a restaurant drinking with my wife and friend. The next thing I remember is waking up in bed. We live 40 minutes from the restaurant. My wife took me home and put me to bed. She left me in bed while she went to play online. At some point I woke up and vomited. I then passed out again. Today I was teasing her about how I could have choked and died on my own vomit. She said she wasn’t responsible for me. AITA for being hurt by that statement? I thought marriage and relationships meant you took care of each other even when you did stupid stuff?ETA: We’ve been together 20 years. I drink maybe 4 times a year and then only have a few. I do have a very high tolerance. I’ve only been that drunk that time and had no intention of getting to that point. This was at least 4+ years ago. ETA: I never expected her to clean up vomit!!
8,2021-03-17 00:34:17,Asshole,5459,m6br6d,2347,AITA to telling my wife to stop calling herself a mother,"My wife and I have been together for 5 years and married for 3. I’m 26 and she’s 25. Before we got together when she was 17 she was with someone else and she got pregnant. She lost that baby at 32 weeks due to the baby contracting a lung infection and dying. It sucks and is tragic and she visits the babies grave every year on the anniversary of its death. I have no problem with that. When people ask if we have any kids, I say no and she says she had a baby but it passed away. It makes people really uncomfortable and we’ve talked about how not everyone needs to know about her dead kid. Our issue arose when yesterday, which was supposed to be her due date, she went and got a tattoo of the babies hand prints and the name she gave it which she had been talking about for years and I was always reluctant for her to do (it seems kinda trashy but I don’t like tattoos in general) and posted it on Facebook with a big long caption about how “even though she wasn’t his earth side mother for long he taught her so much” and “How being his mother was the greatest gift she could ask for.”I told her to stop calling herself a mother and posting depressing stuff on Facebook. It was almost a decade ago and she’s still holding on to it. What is she going to say when we have kids? That she has this many kids alive and this many dead? She told me I was being an insensitive dick head and it’s no different than if her baby died at 6 months old. She still held it, fed it with her body, loved it and created a space in her world for it. She hasn’t talked to me since yesterday and slept in our guest room.I feel like she needs to get over it because it was almost 10 years ago and she’s acting like it’s fresh. AITA?The baby didn’t die in utero or was stillborn. It was born, developed a lung infection and died like 5 days after it was born."
9,2021-03-17 21:50:19,Asshole,76,m6zo6x,294,Aita for shouting at a woman for letting her dogs bark at my service dog,"Basically I was going to the pharmacy & when I got off the bus i saw a woman in the queue with 2 chihuahuas in a stroller which immediately started going crazy & upon noticing she had made no effort to stop them barking I got a bit annoyed & said ‘this is a service dog you need to keep your dogs quiet’ Again- no effort to shut them up. My service dog was sitting nicely between my feet doing his best to ignore them like he’s supposed to, but he’s still training and a lot of dogs snap at him for no reason so he’s a bit wary of other dogs.The woman then put the dogs on the ground and they barked even more!All this time the woman was more interested in staring at my service dog and saying how cute and well behaved he is, but NO EFFORT TO STOP HER DOGS BARKING AT HIM! 😡This went on the entire time at the pharmacy then when I left i realised she was inside a food shop (which btw banned me and my service dog for no reason) with the dogs STILL going crazy, barking at my dog through the window!!!Then I got further down the road and had to stop for my dog to do a poo lol so the woman started catching up, with the dogs STILL going crazy at my dog, all the way down the street! I should probably point out I’m autistic so loud noises really stress me out as does anyone knowingly disturbing my dog, and when I get over stimulated I have a meltdown where basically I can no longer control what I do or say and basically start screaming and shouting at people :(  So basically near the end of the road I couldn’t cope with the barking any more and stared to lose it and turned round and shouted ‘can you PLEASE just SHUT THEM UP! PLEASE JUST MAKE THEM STOP!’ The woman was all like ‘wtf why you talking to me like that?’ And basically I ended up shouting at her for ages while trying to get my point across that my dog was a service dog and her dogs can’t be barking at him like that (it was NON STOP for sooooo long... would she do that to a blind person with a guide dog?!?) and my dog ended up growling because it had gone so long, which he’s not allowed to do and that is exactly why she shouldn’t have allowed her dogs to bark for so long!The woman gave me a bullshit excuse about how her dogs ‘aren’t barking, they’re just scared’ (they were barking though that was the whole point lol) and said they’re scared cuz they were carried and would be fine on the ground but if that’s true why carry them? Also she did put them down in the queue and they still barked at us.  She also said she brings them to shops because she wants to bring them places with her. Anyway, I do realise I shouldn’t have started shouting the way I did (as I said I’m autistic and that’s what happens when I’m overstimulated) but at the same time I don’t feel like there’s much else I could do, I told her from the start my  dog is a service dog and it even says ‘service dog in training on his harness, but she never made any attempts whatsoever to stop it.Edit- this was a full 20 mins of them barkin in my dogs face. I know he needs to ignore distractions and he did pretty well but he’s still in training and has been attacked beforeJeez you people are harsh! LolHonestly though the main reason I posted this is because I know i come across as just being a dick when I have a meltdown, which  I’m hoping I can work on, so all these answers will be very helpful :)Edit 2- I have accepted that I was in the wrong and will apologise if I see her again :)"
10,2021-03-17 23:23:28,Asshole,45,m71j94,87,AITA - I interrupted my husband's story because I saw something I wanted to photograph,"Update INFO: To clarify, what **keeps happening** is  that he seems to get unusually irritated by seemingly innocuous convo blips.  In this case, it was me pausing his story, so I could take a photo. It took me 3 seconds to snap the photo, and I asked him to continue because I **really** wanted to hear it. But he wouldn't. Unless I'm in an alternate universe, to me it seems that normal conversation is sometimes interrupted. ""Look at that cool car"" he'll say while I'm telling him about a movie. Neither one of us is a garrulous constant talker, BTW. PS, this is my first ever post! Really interesting array of perspectives on what constitutes assholery.\---We were out walking the dog, and my husband was telling me a story about a neighbor. As he was talking, I noticed something I'd been wanting to take a picture of. So I said ""Oh, hang on, let me just get this. I've been meaning to grab this image."" As I snapped the photo, he says ""Uh, OK, I'm done with the story."" I was dismayed by this passive-aggressive tone. When I asked what he thinks is the right way to behave, he said I should have not said anything, and just stopped to take the photo and let him continue with his story. I replied that if I HAD stopped without saying anything, he would have said ""Why are you stopping?"" So either way I'm interrupting his story.AITA for interrupting his story to tell him why I was stopping to take a photo? I wanted to hear the rest of it what he was saying, but our morning is ruined, and I suddenly feel like I missed the life lesson on how to interact in a socially acceptable manner. Isn't polite interruption a normal course of human conversation? This keeps happening to us."
11,2021-03-18 01:50:49,Asshole,22,m74sp8,25,AITA for not moving to a different spot,"So I went to Florida for spring break (on the coast at a resort) and today I thought it would be a good idea to go to the beach so I put on my swim suit and walked down to the beach, there were no spots open except one which was covered in the resort’s towels and no personal belongings so I set up shop on a chair and took a nap while my little brother swam in the ocean with my parents when I woke up I heard people talking to me and saying “you need to get up those were our seats, we were holding them” and I said no I wasn’t going to move because they didn’t have any personal belongings just a bunch of towels (I noticed they had two small children with them probably 5 & 6 y/o) and the mom call me an asshole. So AITA"
12,2021-03-18 01:52:48,Asshole,20,m74uc5,36,AITA for having a guy in a wheelchair crawl up icy stairs to my restaurant?,"I live in Wyoming and my city just had the 3rd largest snow storm in its history, 33 inches in 2 days. Inexplicably a day after the storm my restaurant chooses to be open. We show up and the building and surrounding area is BURIED. We are understaffed and have restaurant prep to do as well as dig this place out. It took 2 of us 3 hrs to carve out paths up the stairs to the building, the sidewalk and most of the handicap ramp. I say most because the snow drifts on the ramp exceeded 4 feet deep. Of course, of all days one of the few walk in guests we received was a family with a man in a wheelchair that they somehow pushed through feet of snow and ice to the steps of our building. The family was irate to find out we hadn't fully cleared our walk ways 24hrs after a historic storm. The man in the wheelchair preceded to ""fall"" dramatically out of his chair and crawl up 9 icy steps, wanting no help, with his wife carrying his chair behind him. Am I the asshole?"
13,2021-03-18 04:59:33,Asshole,9,m795p3,65,AITA for refusing to take my cousin to a clinic and instead being with my dog,"I have an 8 month-old rescue Irish Bernedoodle who is for the most part pretty calm, but will have a major case of the zoomies every few hours. She can't be left alone yet though. My grandma (who I live with) also recently had hip surgery so she can't watch her.Now the issue my cousin (we're both 16f) found out she was pregnant awhile ago and doesn't want to tell her parents, only today told me she needed a ride to a clinic for an appointment she made a few days ago. She only told me last, minute and assumed I would drive her, which I would've if she had given me a heads up. Now if my grandpa was home I probably would've been able to take her, or if she'd given me a heads up I could've made arrangements.So I refused saying that I won't leave my recovering grandma alone with a dog that needs attention because she didn't plan ahead. I also said that she needs to get her shit together.This made her cry about how she can't have her mum find out and just wants to get rid of it so the stress and lies can go away, I also told her she brought this upon herself. That made her yell at me that I want to ruin her life by making her keep the baby (I honestly could care less what she does with her body, I'm also very pro-choice) and just berating me about how I'm choosing my dog over her and her needs.AITA? She ranted to one of our friends who's on her side and said I'm the AH.Edit- one thing I should elaborate on, is although my dog is somewhat calm, she's a rescue that I got a couple moths ago and can't be left alone yet. Crates also aren't an option because she came from an abusive household where they were used, she's terrified of them."
14,2021-03-17 04:31:16,Asshole,791,m6h9ev,413,AITA for wearing heels to my fiance's sister's wedding when it makes my fiance uncomfortable because he is short?,"Hello, I'm 5""8 and my fiance is 5""3. I actually have a preference for shorter men and all of my boyfriends have been shorter than me. I guess sort of because men who are taller than me make me uncomfortable because of an incident in my past (yes I'm getting therapy for it don't ask about it).While the short stature of my boyfriend usually comes up playfully, sometimes things do annoy him. I was looking at pictures on Facebook of his sister's wedding from a couple years ago and the height difference started to bother him. Specifically, the situation was that he asked me to not wear heels when we went to family gatherings because it would exacerbate our height difference and it would be kept it photos. Well we had a really stupid argument the day of his sister's wedding that was more like a playful fight over who was better at something and I remember putting on heels to the wedding just to annoy him. I didn't think it was a big deal, it was just like a joke I guess and I thought it made for some really cute photos with us together. Anyways, we saw the wedding photos on Facebook and one of his stupid college friends that he hardly knows anymore made a joke about hoping a short man like fiance could satisfy a woman like me. While I blocked him immediately, this started a whole stupid argument about how mean I was for wearing heels. But I feel like the only reason he is bringing this up now is because of what some stupid guy he used to know said. I apologized but he wants me to promise to not wear heels when we are together and I just don't think I should have to.AiTA for wearing heels around my short fiance even though it makes him uncomfortable?"
15,2021-03-18 03:42:52,Asshole,10,m77f6z,58,AITA for asking my bro to pay me back what I'm owed,"My (24M) bro (21M) accidentally used my credit card for a purchase (same acct diff cards) by accident (let's say like $5). I requested that he give me back for the purchase around two months ago (with no urgency as I knew he's strapped for cash) on zelle (important info) but he has yet toRecently in the midst of waiting for him to repay me my bday passed. Now I'm not a gift asker and I honestly don't care if I don't get gifts cause I like quality time but nice if people gift. My brother gifted me money for my bday since he asked me what I wanted, but again if he never asked I'll never ask him for a gift nor expect one. Let's just say the amt was $200.Now it's been another month since my bday passed and the zelle request expired cause it's been so long so I just renewed the request cause it alerted me it was expired and my bro blew up saying how I'm petty for asking him to repay me what he owes me when he gave me a gift of $200.I told him when I received the gift it wasn't under the impression that was gift + what he owes me but a gift? He then told me then for my bday he didn't gift me $200 but $195. AITA for asking him to repay me back and thinking that the monetary gift was separate from that?Ps. I'm not super stingy about money because I spend a lot on people in general. Even my brother (he doesn't know), while he wasn't working and using my parents money I would pay his portion of the card because I wanted to and I don't hold that over him. I was mad because after he started making his own money it's apparent he's super stingy (in terms of paying back) about money to the point where if he owes me $30.32 he'll round down and then pay me only the whole sum (which unless people say you can round down I think it'll rude to round down on your own as someone who owes money). Honestly I also work hard for each cent I make and it kinda feels like he doesn't respect my money which is ultimately my time (which is more why I'm mad cause time is precious) I could honestly care less about the $5 but he continually keeps not paying me or my family back saying he's stressed cause he's not making much (but then goes and buys thousands of dollars worth on camera eqpt for fun. We have to constantly ask him for weeks to repay us."
16,2021-03-18 02:31:08,Asshole,11,m75qgt,27,AITA for closing my brothers door?,"I'm 19 F and recently moved back home with my family after over a year of living with roommates. Long story short one of my roommates was in a bad relationship and it eventually became an unsafe situation. While I was away I was attending college, however, due to financial issues I am no longer in school and currently work part time at a restaurant.  The way our house is set up my parents have their own bathroom, while me and my brother share a bathroom which is adjacent to/shares a wall with my room. Also, we have central AC (we live in Florida) and one of the AC vents is located in my room (but none of the other bedrooms have one) so when it's especially hot out I have to leave my door open/slightly ajar for the AC to work. I hate having to leave my door open especially at night because I wake up kind of easily and I like my privacy. I've even asked to turn off the AC and just use fans at night so I can close my door but they all complain its too hot. My brother (16 M) however, can only sleep with his door open and gets scared if it's closed. He is currently in hs (schools are open where we live) & sometimes wakes up early before school to workout too. Every morning he showers before school, which is fine, except he blasts music loudly from his phone so I can hear it pounding throughout my room through the shared wall. If I bang on the wall or yell at him to turn it down he does, but then my dad starts yelling at me that I'm a trouble maker and it turns into a huge fight. I work nights and barely slept last semester due to anxiety, so it would be nice if I could sleep in later than 6am without being woken up. I've texted my brother about it a couple times and he responds that he'll be quieter and then forgets and does the same thing the next morning. They also talk loudly right outside my room which wakes me up because I have to keep my door ajar. If I bring it up to my parents they tell me that it's my fault for being on a different sleep schedule and that I need to stop going out with my bf at night and get a new job thats during the day. Neither of my parents work right now and are using govt. assistance from their business.I was fed up when I came home the other night so I went over to my brothers room and shut his door while he was sleeping. He heard it shut and got up to try and open it but I held it closed. He started panicking so I opened it and told him now he knows how I feel when he wakes me up in the morning. My parents heard the commotion and it turned into a big fight. My family wants me to move out, but I hardly have any money left over from work after food, gas, clothes, & paying my dad $ for my car, health insurance & cell phone (i've asked him to remove me from the bill so I can pay them directly but he tells me I need to stay on the family plan). I told him that if they're not going to be respectful of my sleep schedule then I'm not going to be respectful of theirs and will continue to close my brother's door.AITA?"
17,2021-03-17 14:14:11,Asshole,83,m6sw8n,142,AITA for telling my friend to study more,"Hello all, this is a throwaway as many of my friends know my main. Anyhow, I (21F) am currently in school full-time for nursing and medicine, so I have a lot of stuff on my plate. However, I recently reconnected with an old friend from HS (22F). She originally planned to go into nursing but changed her major to be a correctional officer. She's also in a legal runt right now, trying to get a restraining order on her ex etc. She and I got into an argument about whether a public defender is the same as a pro bono lawyer. (Hint: they're not.) I got a bit upset when she kept insisting they're the same. I'm also upset that she's studying law and doesn't know the basics. Even I don't know law and I know the difference. I suggested to her to ask her Professors and to study a bit more so she doesn't get confused down the road. She got a bit irate to say the least. AITA?"
18,2021-03-18 00:55:02,Asshole,11,m73j65,20,"AITA for asking my Mom(57) to watch my 1 year old since I’m(35f) very sick, so is my husband(38), and my daughter(4).","Here is some backstory. On Monday my 1 year old was up all night vomiting. She couldn’t keep anything down. Also, the highest temperature she reached was 99.9, so no actual fever. The next day she was fine.Queue my 4 year old. At about 10pm the poor baby vomited all over herself and her bed while she was sleeping. My husband cleaned her up and put her in bed with me. About 20 minutes later she vomited all over my bed and me. We were up with her until 4 am. At this point my husband and I are feeling a little queasy and go to sleep. Then I get up with my 1 year old daughter at 6am and immediately I’m in the bathroom. When I finish in the bathroom my husband runs in there too, but with a bucket. This is a vomiting and explosive diarrhea situation. It’s not been a good morning.Usually, I try very hard not to ask for help. It makes me uncomfortable, but it’s something I’m working on. I especially try not to ask my Mom for help, because it always comes with the question of if I actually need help or a story about how she did it all on her own with 5 kids. I, also, know with Covid everyone is being cautious for good reason, but we are in a bad way over here, and since the baby has been through it already I thought it might be okay. Also, other than vomiting and diarrhea we don’t have any other symptoms.So, at 7:10 am I called my mom and asked her to please watch my 1 year old today since the rest of us are very sick. She agreed and just needed some time to wake up. Important to note that she started working a seasonal job yesterday and worked a six hour shift. She’s off for the next two weeks until the planting season starts. At 8:40 am I called her again to let her know just to take my van since I can’t hook up the car seat for her. At this point she tells me that she is very sore and doesn’t want to get sick, but she will still take my 1 year old for a couple hours, but not until later. At this point I remind her it’s been an hour and a half since we talked. She had no idea, but she needs a lot more time. I asked if she means around 11 am and she says maybe then. This upset me, because if she can’t help or isn’t comfortable helping she should just tell me so that I might be able to make other plans.I feel bad, ungrateful, and upset that she won’t get my 1 year old earlier, since I really need the help now. Due to this I feel like I may be the Asshole, and if we weren’t all so sick I would have not even asked. I put this before the people of Reddit for your consideration. What’s your verdict?Edit: Just got back to this. My husband and I spent the afternoon and most the night in the ER getting fluids (since we hadn’t been able to keep anything down) and bringing down our fever that had spiked very high. They did a lot of tests. They are doing blood cultures to see if we have an infection in our blood, but they think it’s a bad virus going around.Test results: Negative Covid and Flu"
19,2021-03-18 02:17:35,Asshole,6,m75fa2,22,AITA for saying I didn't want to shit on people in a group chat?," AITA for saying I didn't want to shit on people in a group chat?I was making some friends online and I got invited to a group chat with them (me and four other people). I'd been in the group chat for several months and things seemed to be going well, it was mostly casual conversations. It was great and I thought everything was going well.I noticed that occasionally the conversations would devolve into talking about some people that I don't personally know, by name, and how horrible they were. I tended to agree that the actions these people had taken did seem pretty mean but I was getting really uncomfortable with the way the group would tear into these people directly. I tried to be patient, and deflect until the conversations ended, I even said once that I was worried about what kinds of things these people must have experienced to think of treating other people the way they had. That maybe we couldn’t know what other people were going through.One day one of the members of the group chat posted a screenshot of something controversial, something someone I would consider a friend posted. I didn't think the content of the screenshot was bad but the group responded with outrage and started condemning this person really harshly. I drafted up a reply and had my partner review it to make sure it wasn’t inflammatory. I said that the behaviors I was noticing in the group were making me feel unsafe to be authentic about my views and beliefs because it seemed that they were intolerant of people holding different perspectives and it was seen as evidence that the people holding those differing views are inherently bad, even irredeemable. I said I didn’t want to be involved in those ‘gossipy’ kinds of conversations. I suggested that if another person’s behavior bothered them it would be more constructive to address it with the offending party, rather than shitting on them in a group chat where they had no defense.One of the members responded defensively saying that it wasn’t their responsibility to educate people on their problematic behaviors and they only have so many spoons to deal with people.I responded to assure them that I respect her decision to use her spoons as they see fit but I doubled down on the fact that I don’t want to be a part of conversations meant to judge other people. And they said “don’t worry, we can exclude you bb” And then kicked me from the group chat and then proceeded to block me on all platforms we were mutuals on.I was really broken up and confused about this reaction, it took me three weeks to get myself together, and then I reached out to another friend from the group chat saying that I wasn’t sure what I had done to offend everyone? I wanted to try to reconcile but I’m honestly not even sure what they wanted me to apologize for? Their response was something along the lines of ‘LMFAO I was trying to be civil before but...’. And then everyone else in the group chat blocked me."
20,2021-03-18 05:25:52,Asshole,2,m79rd1,26,AITA for not helping my bfs HCBM during spring break because I have plans w my kids?,"So spring break is coming up for us. It’s supposed to be on a week that HCBM has the kids. I assumed because we had them the majority of last years spring break she would have them this year. So I have plans to do some stuff with my children during the beginning of the week. Just me and my kids. BF isn’t coming. Well she asked us this AM if we can take the kids most of that week because she has to work. Bf works night so I would HAVE to be there if they are there. Normally I would say yes but I told him I couldn’t because I’m already planning on doing some stuff with my kids because I wasn’t expecting to have them. He said he understood and he tells her what I said and she starts a fight with him saying how she knows HE doesn’t mind doing stuff for their kids and how awful I am for making these plans and not including her kids. My thing is, I do every thing they ask me to for them and those kids and way more. When they are here on our weeks, I take care of them. I do the school stuff, feeding (minus dinner, dad does dinner) and I spend time with them, take them places with me, I’ve never treated those kids any less than mine. I even get them from school for her when she needs on her weeks. I’ll also add that her kids get to do way more stuff than my kids do when they aren’t w us. They have gone to the mountains, beaches, water parks and so much more.  Y’all please keep in mind she has other options available to help her watch them while she works. And my bf and I always make our weeks work with out her help. So AITA for making plans and not including their kids And not being readily available to watch them at her beck and call?

21,2021-03-17 16:23:23,Asshole,34,m6urig,33,AITA for posting about my roomates dead animal?,"Okay, I know by the description it sounds bad, but let me explain. I (F18), moved into an off campus apartment for freshman year of college and ended up being roommates with a girl we will call Caroline (F20). Caroline was a very...obnoxious person to live with. She cared about nothing more than partying and drugs and on multiple occasions put myself and other two roommates in unsafe situations by inviting over random people without asking us among other things. She also had a large issue with responsibility, despite being the oldest of all of us, and was unable to keep up her studies or maintain a proper part time job due to having issues with drugs, and in her opinion mental issues. We lived in an apartment complex in which you had to either be a full time student, or a full time job, neither of which she had, but we also were not allowed to have any pets as stated in our lease. Caroline decided, despite myself and other two roommates batting against it, to “save” a free dog off craigslist: a female puppy we will call Lucy. Lucy was a very shy dog, who had obviously been abused or mistreated as shown through her mannerisms and anxiety around people and often relived herself inside the house. My roommate refused to take her to a vet to get checked because she had spent a majority of her finances on drugs and herself instead of medical care for her animal. Lucy also had badly matted fur by her tail, which my roommate took the liberty of shaving near the base of the tailto remedy, thus giving Lucy a wounded tail. Because of this, there were multiple instances in which I contacted animal control and our apartment in an effort to have the dog removed and have Caroline fined for having a pet, in order to secure my security deposit and stay within the realm of our lease, but to my dismay resolution to this  came at a very bad time. One day, while driving with Lucy in the car with the windows down going a fair speed, Lucy jumped out of Caroline’s car, got hit by a bus, and died. My roommate was absolutely hysterical over the loss of her animal, but I felt relieved. I was sad that Lucy had passed as it was not her fault for being put in the situation, but I felt before it would be best if Caroline did not have animals. The day after Lucy died Caroline finally received a $500 fine for having a pet in the apartment. After a while, I moved out due to unrelated traumatic circumstances and in an effort to work through my experiences and school, I took to social media. I made a video explaining the shock of my first semester and the situation with Caroline, outlining the actions I took with animal control and the apartment complex and the tragic manner in which Lucy passed, but to my dismay this was riddled with hate from Caroline’s friends. They claimed I was clout chasing and “obsessed” with the situation and that Lucy was not mistreated, but after living with Caroline I disagreed. So, AITA for expressing my situation over social media and “using my roommates dead animal for clout”?edit: I never mentioned any names or places in the post, it was as vague as the message I made above, even more so because it was a short video. Also, Lucy was not the only animalI saw mistreated under Caroline’s care. She had two hermit crabs she only fed, and I wish I was kidding, dried out carrots that were eventually rescued and now belong to one of Caroline’s friend who is a very caring pet parent. ALSO I filed a report on the dog weeks prior and had no control over when Caroline received the fine, that was an unfortunate coincidence."
22,2021-03-16 17:16:59,Asshole,2014,m645ue,630,AITA for making my (40F) eldest daughter (15F) do more work than her siblings?,"My daughter Anna, 15 going on 16, is great. She does all her work, she doesn't throw tantrums, and is energetic. But, I think over the years, especially as she became a teenager, she realized that she did much more work than her 3 other siblings. Don't get me wrong, she still does her chores, but every know and then she acts up to somehow prove to us that what we were doing was supposedly unfair.For example, when I told her and her sister, Sarah, (13F) to hang the clothes, Anna came out first and starts doing her job while Sarah took more than 5 minutes. Anna got annoyed and tells me that her sister is taking so long and that she's already nearly finished. I was conflicted - Anna was already nearly finished and if I asked Sarah to go and help her, Sarah would likely get mad. I thought it was not worth it, and told Anna to please just finish herself. When things like this happened, usually Anna would just sigh and say okay. But more often now, she leaves her job unfinished. When I gently tell her to go and finish it (usually I am busy with farm work, making dinner, etc) Anna triumphantly says something along the lines of ""Well you didn't tell Sarah to go and do it, why are you telling me?""Today as Anna, me and my husband worked at the farm, she said she thought Sarah was so selfish. She was going on about how we never really saw Sarah's true side, how bullied our son (we have already seriously talked to Sarah about it), how Sarah was so 'dumb' and the reason why Anna will never have kids was because she shared Sarah's genetics. I felt terrible.Last night we always have 2 hours of study after school for all the kids. Sarah decided upon herself to finish 30 minutes early, and Anna told me what happened. I was tired after farm work, and was definitely not up for an argument. I ignored Anna and went to teach my son. Anna never said anything after, but she has started speaking to me less. Talking less. I don't know if this means anything but I saw her writing in her diary last night when I went to shower. I feel like ever since she became a teenager, she started diaries and I sometimes see her writing in it before night. I don't pry and leave her be, but I feel like she is hiding something against us.These days she is not afraid to express her hatred against them, even in front of them. Her and her siblings have extremely rough relationships. They never exactly go into full on arguments and fights, but will definitely take malicious jabs at each other. My daughters themselves have already made it clear to me that they hate eachother. My kids all hate eachother. Anna especially hates her siblings. I feel like Anna is starting to not trust me and my husband anymore. I feel like a failure of a parent. I don't know what to do.AITA?"

His money is in a bank account with very low interest (0.01%), and I encouraged him to switch to a bank with better interest (Ally bank at 0.5% interest, so 50x more). He got mad and said he didn’t want to/didn’t feel like it and would switch when he got a real job and was making money.Well, he just got a real job! I brought it up to him and he said he wasn’t going to switch anytime soon because it’s not at the “top of his to-do list” and he “just doesn’t feel like it”. He’s mad for telling him what to do with his money and is saying I have no right. He says it's his money and he will do what he wants with it.My side is that I am frustrated! It takes 5 minutes to create a new bank account with 50x the interest, so shouldn’t this be common sense on his part? I would see this as completely different if I were telling him how he could spend his money, but I'm just wanting him to have an account where he's going to be making more."
24,2021-03-17 07:30:02,Asshole,88,m6l908,63,AITA for not inviting the grandparents (they're the parents of their late mom) of my daughters to their birthday?,"I'm not their biological mom but I've raised them (they're twins) since they were a few days old, I was hired to be their babysitter and we used to spend a lot of time together because no one in their family wanted to spend time with them and I guess it was because it hurt them to see the girls because they looked a lot like their mom or because their mom died when they were born, I never knew.Their mom's relatives only see them twice a year, for their birthday and for christmas, but this year we decided not to invite them. In our country we can celebrate birthdays but only with 10 people and it has to be outdoors, so we didn't invite them because the girls wanted my parents to be at their birthday party and for that we had to remove two people from the list and they decided they wanted to remove the parents of their late mother and we respected their decision because they love my parents because they have known them since I was their babysitter and they were babies and they love them too. But when their grandparents found out that we celebrated their birthday and we didn't invite them, they got mad at me because they think I made that decision alone. They texted me telling me that since I married their dad he does everything I tell him to do, that I brainwashed the girls so that they call me mom and so that they love my family more than their biological family. And none of that is true, the girls call me mom since I married their dad a few years ago when they were only two and he was the one who told them that they could call me that and they loved it. And they love my family because like I said, they used to spend a lot of time with them, not because I forced them to.I always talk to them about their biological mom and they have photos of her in their rooms because we want them to always remember her and they love her, I also talk to them about their relatives but they don't love them one bit and I cannot control that. They are 6 years old and they decide who to love and who not.Am I the asshole for not inviting them?"
25,2021-03-17 09:32:08,Asshole,38,m6npku,67,AITA for keeping a cat in my room?,"I'll try to keep this short and sweet. Backstory: I (21M) live with my parents (late 60s M and F) and my older brother (24M). At the beginning of lockdown I moved back in with my parents (I had been living at college) and began taking care of a stray cat that visited. My entire family loves cats and specifically adores this cat,the problem is that both my mom and my brother are very allergic, which meant NO CATS in the house. I was fine with this until I met my stray cat.I have been living in the guest room of my parents house during breaks ever since I moved off the college, and that has been the room I have lived in since lockdown.  This room has french doors that lead right outside, and the cat likes to hang out around these doors and sometimes looks in. I feed him a regular amount of food everyday and brush him to keep his fur from becoming disheveled. The problem is that the nearby coyote population has become larger and I have seen one in front of my house before. We do not have a shed or outdoor shelter for this cat to stay in while it rains or has heavy winds either, I have watched him huddle underneath a plastic chair for hours during a heavy rain. My empathy got the better of me and I have been keeping him indoors at night. I have grown seriously attached and he is the only thing I talk to anymore about my thoughts or my day in general. The cat stays in my room the entire night, I make sure he cannot leave to the rest of the house. However, this means that my mom and brother are unable to enter my room without an allergic reaction.My mom has caught the cat in my room twice since then and each time will leave abruptly and stay angry at me for a while, whilst telling me I cannot have the cat in my room and I am risking her health. AITA for keeping the cat in my room? I try my best to clean after him (just fur and the occasional leaf he brings in). She has tried allergy medication in the past and it has made her gravely ill, so I am not looking for a medical solution. TLDR: I live with my family because of covid-19. Mom and brother are allergic to a stray cat I keep in my room at night in fear of coyotes. Mom has caught the cat in my room twice and carries the anger with her until she blows up and yells at me for a full day.Edit: formatting on mobile looks bad. Also adding on that my parents and I do not have a great relationship to begin with, as they are very passive aggressive about my ""lifestyle"" and my changing of majors, so we don't talk much. Seeing as how I am the asshole, if anyone has any tips on how to approach my apology to someone who doesn't talk to me much I'd greatly appreciate it. I will be looking into rehoming the cat as soon as possible.Second edit: I brush him outside while he is eating (also outside). I clean my own room I don't expect her to ever clean for me.Third edit: both my dad and brother know I keep the cat at night and both are fine with it. My brother was actually the one who told me to keep the cat in my room in the first place."
26,2021-03-17 10:15:49,Asshole,33,m6ojzs,58,AITA for getting upset with my friend who I was supposed to move with for changing plans last minute,So me and my best friend were supposed to move to Dallas together. We both live in Oklahoma and hate it here. We were supposed to move there last year but of course COVID changed that. Let me give you a little back story. Although we both want to move to Dallas it’s not our end goal. We both agreed we only wanted to live there for a year or two before moving on to a better city. I’ve always dreamed of living in Japan and she wanted to live in New York. But Dallas was a good transition spot where we could save up money and still be close to our parents before our big leap. We both hate living here but for me I’m especially trying to escape. I feel trapped here and living with my parents is horrible. They’re always yelling at each other about something and it’s just a really toxic environment. So we were both looking for jobs in Dallas and once we landed one we would start are apartment hunting. During the pandemic we were looking but understood that it would take a bit and in the meantime we both moved back in with our parents. At the beginning of this year we decided that we would try to move ASAP. We wanted to move their by the summer. I was applying to everything that had a good salary because I figured I could always find a better job but at least I would finally be able to make the move. I got a job offer a couple of weeks ago and although it wasn’t the best job it was good enough. I was so excited. Finally I would be out of this toxic environment for good. She had been applying to jobs too but she was more selective which is fine. She had told me that she had been interviewing for jobs but they had a lot of rounds of interviews. Today she texted me she got a job offer. I was ecstatic finally are dreams were coming true. But her job is in New York. I felt like I could throw up. I knew she wanted to move to New York eventually but I didn’t know she was applying to jobs there right now. She mentioned that she applied at a job in New York only once and when I asked what would happen if she got that job she told me that it was remote and that she would still move to Dallas for a year. Even when I talked to her last week I brought up how it will be so fun when we move to Dallas and she agreed with me and even said that her little sister was gonna be our unofficial roommate because she hangs out with us all the time. But now she’s saying she will be moving to New York in June. So we got in a argument over text.Basically she doesn’t understand why I’m not happy for her since it’s her dream job. But I explained to her that I am happy for her I just wish she would have told me earlier about her plans and that I’m frustrated because now I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I don’t want to move to Dallas by myself because that was never the end goal. I was only going to move there because she would be with me and I wouldn’t have to worry about being lonely and rent would be cheaper but there’s no point for me to move there by myself. She doesn’t understand why I’m frustrated. So am I the asshole?
27,2021-03-17 00:41:09,Asshole,177,m6bwn8,526,AITA for bringing my girlfriend to son's wedding even though she wasn't invited?,"My (53M) son Aiden (24M) had a small wedding last Saturday. Measures in our country are loose.Aiden's mom and I divorced 10 years ago when she cheated on me. She had 2 marriages, two divorces and managed to get knocked up by her dentist. I was single most of that time till I started dating Callie (25F) last year. We clicked and have been living together lately. She was actually my student, but we only started dating after she finished college. So here's the issue. My son announced the wedding 2 months ago. We knew that he was getting married for a year, but were waiting for covid to pass. Callie was very excited as we were stuck in the house all this time. We went shopping, I bought her a lovely dress and shoes. Invitations arrive 2 weeks before the wedding and I don't get a ""+1"". I call my son and he says that no one has it because of covid. I was a bit irritated but okay. The day of wedding. I arrive there and everyone has a plus one. I'm at the table with my ex wife and her no name new boyfriend. I ask around and it turns out my son lied to me. I excuse myself and call Callie, telling her to get ready and come anyway. She arrives and sits with us. Everything is in fact great, my ex and Callie got together well (I actually also met my ex at the college).My son then pulls me aside and shout/whispers what the hell is Callie doing here. I say I know he lied about ""+1""s so I invited her anyway, she already bought a dress etc. Then he says that his wife is jealous of Callie and didn't want her upstaging the bride and now she's here and looks amazing. He asks me to make Callie leave, but I refuse because it's mean to have her leave alone. I say that if he cares so much then I, his father, will leave with her and miss the rest of the wedding. He agrees and we leave. We went to a bar next to the restaurant where the wedding was held. 30 minutes later my ex and her boyfriend join us. In the next few hours like 8 more people joined (we didn't invite anyone, seems like everyone's first idea was to go to the nearest bar). Turns out the bride was so insecure that she made all younger women invited dress uglier than her and forbade certain hairstyles (the hell?). When Callie arrived the bride started drinking heavily and there were some scenes in the hours after we left, which is why some people also left. Anyway my son called me on Monday and accused me of ruining his wedding because I had to have my ""skank"" (it was actually a worse term) over. Says that his new wife went to her mother's because she's angry. I say that the emotion she should feel is embarrassment. He calls me a ""fucking hippie"" and hangs up (very uncalled for). I'm still getting calls from what seems like every family member, including son's wife's side, calling me out for what I did. I don't know what to think so I figured I'll post here."
28,2021-03-17 07:02:01,Asshole,51,m6knhm,103,AITA for going to a strip club and not telling my wife?,"Literally nothing happened. My boss invited me out with him and a few other guys. I don’t like my boss that much, but he likes me so I go along with it. My wife knows this (she doesn’t like him either). We’ve had him over a few times too.I went out with them and we ended up in a strip club. It was sort of an upscale one, maybe more of a bar-like setting, but still a strip club. I’d never been but it was fine. As a joke, the guys I was with gave one of the women money and she gave me a lap dance, but that was it. They had a few dances too but it was actually pretty low-key. If it had been some crazy debauched thing like it is in movies or one of them had gone off to have sex, it would be different, but it was literally like having dinner in a bar with overly attentive staff.I came home late, my wife was already asleep but when I came in I woke her up so I was just like yeah I was out with my boss and sort of rolled my eyes. We fooled around a bit and then I crashed. Then this morning we didn’t really talk much, I was hungover and she was working and doing her own thing.BUT she’s actually good friends with my boss’s on-off-again girlfriend (we set them up, but that’s another story), so the girlfriend told my wife, I guess assuming that she knew.My wife came back to me and was like “Why didn’t you tell me you were at a strip club.” I immediately said it was boss and friends’ idea, not mine, which she seems to completely believe. I also said that nothing happened, which she seems to mostly believe.To be clear, I was always going to tell her, I was just hungover and she had work and it just seemed like a dinner conversation not a pre-coffee conversation. And she knows/believes that now.She’s somehow most irritated about the fact that we fooled around when I got home. And now she’s pissed at me and I think purposely slamming drawers and things because she’s mad but also because she knows I’m hungover.**TLDR: I went to a strip club but it wasn't my idea and nothing happened. My wife is upset that I didn't tell her right when I got home.**"
29,2021-03-16 13:19:37,Asshole,1161,m60tk9,497,AITA for refusing to clean but offering to pay for a cleaner?,"I (32M) live with my wife (30F) of 2 years.We have a shower stall that only I use, and a bath that only my wife uses. The shower stall has accumulated some rust and I'm really not bothered by it, but my wife wanted it cleaned as it's bothering her. She asked me to clean it, as I'm the only one who uses the shower.I said that I would hire a cleaner to come by and deal with it. The reason for this is that I am a lawyer, I have the ability to take on as much work as I want, and if I spent the time it would take to clean the shower instead doing my job for compensation, I would make about four times as much money as it would cost to hire a cleaner. In my view it simply does not make economic sense for me to use my time personally cleaning the shower.My wife refused to let me hire someone to clean, saying she doesn't want a stranger coming into our house and doing menial labour that I'm ""too lazy"" to do. She finds this embarrassing. I refused to budge and my wife ended up just cleaning the shower herself, although begrudgingly and she's giving me grief for it.Who is in the wrong here? Thanks."
30,2021-03-17 15:55:06,Asshole,7,m6ud9e,21,AITA for yelling at my soon to be boss when trying to defend myself,"Please read all the way through.E- manager in backstory X- girl  this is about F- best coworker everR- manager intraingSome background info so everything makes since. I'm a female that got a job at McDonald's shortly after I turned 16 in September 2020. When I first started everything was good until I worked with a manager that sexually harassed me (she tried to set me up with a 24yr old guy when I'm asexual. While also being touchy). she was suspended but what this is about is X. She started taunting me when E was suspended. I Ignored it but mentioned it to corporate at the meeting over E.Every manager I worked with started putting me in the back window everyday I worked. (No one else would do it and I always felt like it was punishment for getting E in trouble.) Well one day our manager sent X back to take my spot while I was to go on break. But when she came back she got in my face and was yelling. I responded in a calm fashion saying you do not talk like that to me. (She did this in front of customers and F.) When she had stopped I told her that I was going to wait for so and so. I wasn't going to be talked to like that. I told a manager what happened, and F later that night when asked what exactly was going on. I knew that X was standing right there, and I would have told her what I said if she wasn't, because I'm not going to say something that I wouldn't say to someone's face. Later that night she found me online and started her bullying there. She stalked me online for about 2-3 weeks before I blocked her. after that she started it back up at work. Calling me fat and retarded along with other degrading things. I told multiple managers on many occasions, and was ignored. This leads up to a few days ago. I was waiting to clock in and X said something that I ignored. After I clocked in I went and asked R ""can I please be up here today?"" I was told no which upset me a bit because I was constantly in the back window only allowed a thin jacket and a heater that is too loud. (I was constantly getting sick for always being in the cold air and it did not help my asthma either). Later that evening the system in the back window started having issues so I went to get our manager, he was on break and not on the premises. So R came back to try and fix it. She took one look and told me she didn't know how but I should by now and to just wait for manager if I didn't.  At this point I was so done that I yelled, ""its bullshit that I'm always back here when everyone gets to go wherever and Manager shouldn't leave because you haven't finished your classes yet. I'm sick of being treated like this."" I tried to work with the system acting like it was. Later I tried to apologize to R but she and X was talking about X wanting yelling at me and going to jump me. I told her it was wrong to tell X know everything going on there. I left early and quit. I wrote R a written apology and left it for her when I turned my uniforms in. And I'm just wondering am i the asshole for trying to defend myself from the bullying and unfair circumstances?Edit:Grammer, spelling and wording"
31,2021-03-18 02:27:00,Asshole,3,m75n0m,35,AITA FOR “BULLYING” MY FRIEND,So basically me (M 16) and my friend group (also M 16) were really tight like we would meet up everyday and play and do dumb stuff. We would also make jokes and we all could take a joke. we would make jokes and say like that’s gay or your gay and stuff. I was really close to this one kid named jay and we would text everyday. Jay was like the main guy and popular kid. Jay was a flirt in a way and was kinda selfish and was bossy. Jay was also not athletic and watches anime ( I don’t watch anime.) I couldn’t watch and do everything with them because Im busy ( for example I’m on a basketball team and none of them do sports.) then I said your gay because he was talking about a tv show. The tv show didn’t even talk about anything gay and it was literally just out of nowhere when I said your gay. So then he obviously says that’s he’s not gay. But then he just blocks me (Even tho it was clearly a joke.) Then they also stops asking me to do things and basically ghosted me. So I texted him to say are you mad at me a week after he and all his friends and him stopped asking me to do things. Then he said he’s not mad but he still never texted me or said hi. So he and all his friends think am like a bully and they hate me. I also heard that they didn’t want to be friends bc they said I never went to do thing with them. I don’t get how this makes sense bc literally 80% of the time I would go with them. And they also would target me and think I’m like the weakest one ( for example when we play like tag or something they would target me) I think if anything they were bullying me. So I still see him and all his friends and this new kid am guessing he replaced me with. What do you think I should do? Do you think I should say sorry or something?

My dad has been teaching me to drive whenever he has the free time, but I have come to the decision that I don't want to drive at all for various reasons. The problem is that neither of my parents has the time to drive me and my sister (11f) around with my mom's car (she works from home, so she only really leaves on weekends), so they were really banking on me getting my license. I've suggested that I use public transportation (our city has shit transportation, but it exists), but my parents are worried about me using it, and they still need someone to pick up my sister and me up from school. Now they've taken to calling me ""inconsiderate of the family's needs"". They are really trying to get me to reconsider, but I just really don't want to drive. AITA for this?"

Because it takes longer to go to work now, I usually eat my breakfast during my walk and throw the garbage away at the station. Today, I had toast (wrapped in a paper towel) and a can of Red Bull for breakfast and finished eating about a block away from home. Luckily for me, today is our area's garbage day so everybody had their garbage cans and recycling bins on the curb and the garbage and recycling trucks have not come by yet. I didn't feel like carrying my garbage all the way to the station so I chucked my can into one dude's recycling bin and popped my napkin into his garbage bin.My partner gave me a dirty look and said that I shouldn't have done that. She thinks I'm an asshole for doing that because I'm throwing my garbage away into a stranger's garbage bin without their permission. I don't think it's a big deal because his garbage was being taken away anyways and it wasn't like I was throwing away a cigarette butt or something like that.So reddit, AITA for throwing my garbage into a stranger's curbside bin on garbage day?"

So several days after filling my taxes my mom casually mentions that she had received my first one and kept it and had used it on Christmas presents for me and some bills.  I decide to tell my grandma about this and she decides to lecture me on the car ride home from work about how when she was a child she hat to pay rent when she got her high school job and that she had never gotten 1k from her father when she was a teen, so I say that when she was a teen the govt wasn't handing out 1000 dollars to people. so this argument put me in an even worse mood than I already was (I work out side so I was cold tired and hungry). so I am currently in my room writing this."

My friend isn’t very good about taking care of their animals and constantly rehomes them for the most random reasons. I was asked to watch their dog around a month ago and when he came to me, he was covered in dirt and poop, and after bathing him I found scabs everywhere that weren’t being treated. I watched him for a week and I grew pretty attached to him, and it seemed like he was pretty attached to me as well. When my friend picked him up, he whined and barked all the way to my friends car trying to get back to me. He’s not being taken care of and I feel so bad for him. I wish I could just take him but I know I can’t. Now my friend is getting another puppy in a few months and I’m secretly hoping that they will get bored of him and rehome him to me.

I believe he was an assistant director or something similar on the set and our group of friends are really excited for him. One of our friends is insisting that we all buy tickets (the tickets are £1 and all money goes to charity)  to the zoom presentation of the award show, but I honestly couldn't think of anything worse.I hate award shows. I think they're long and boring and uninteresting and don't want to attend. Personally, I think I'm justified in not wanting to go my friend hasn't been nominated for the award, the film has, so he has nothing to gain if it wins, and also this isn't just a film related show, the award show celebrates a lot of things that make our city ""great"" and I don't want to sit through three hours of ""Best carrots"" and ""Best dog in show""  However, I do wonder if I'd be TA if I didn't attend as all of our friend group seem really excited for him and I'd obviously be the only one not there. The friend insisting we all go seems to think that I'm just jealous that I've never worked on a film and that I want to make this all about me. I don't think that that is true, I just want to save myself from a night of boredom but idk, reddit, WIBTA if I didn't attend?"

38,2021-03-17 08:04:23,Asshole,16,m6lylo,14,AITA for not wanting to go see my brother?,"Backstory: my mom cheated on my dad back in 2013, got pregnant, the father didn’t want anything to do the baby, and she gave up the baby for adoption. She wanted to keep him, but she was too afraid to leave my dad and was afraid he’d hurt my brother if she kept him. She thought that by giving him up, he’d have a better life. His parents agreed to let him know his biological family which we were all grateful for. I (7 then 14 now) met my brother two months after he was born and my mom and sometimes me and my other siblings get to see him once a year. (Edit: my mom divorced my dad in 2016, she is doing much better now and found the love of her life) I haven’t seen my brother since 2016 or 2017 (don’t really remember). We were scheduled to see him last year in January which I was honestly really happy about, but my mom ended up canceling because she felt really sad and was too emotional for this. I understood but was beyond pissed because I really missed him. We now have a chance to see him in April, but the thing is, I want to, but I also really don’t want to. I miss him and really want to catch up and know more about him, but I suffer from body dysmorphia and severe anxiety. I don’t want anyone to see me, not even my family. Most days, I don’t even interact with them. I wear baggy clothes and get extremely emotional when people comment on what I look like- whether it be positive or negative. This wasn’t so bad before COVID but it has gotten increasingly worse over the past year. I started taking medication for both and other mental illnesses and go to therapy twice a week. I told my mom I wasn’t ready to see him again and she blew up at me. “You got so mad at me last year for canceling! You *have* to go. They’ll all be so heartbroken if you don’t! No one cares what you look like!”This made me feel even worse for not wanting to go. I feel so horrible for this because even his mom and dad texted me asking me to go see him but I can’t. My siblings got mad at me too. I don’t know if I should just give in and go, but at the same time, I really don’t want to push myself. I feel like I need more time to get better but I don’t know. Am I the asshole?"
39,2021-03-17 03:13:37,Asshole,35,m6fggb,45,AITA for not paying my roommate her rent back after allowing the new tenant to store some boxes in her empty room?,"Hello reddit,I'm the main tenant in flat that I share with 3 other students. We usally get along very well. One of my roommates who stayed with us for a couple of years terminated her tenancy agreement in December, which means that including period of notice the agreement will end in  March 31th. She told me that she will be moving in February, since her new flat will be available already Februar 1st. She also asked me if I could try to find a new tennant for March 1st so she wouldnt need to pay rent for March. I tried to find a new tennant as early as I could but IT only worked for April 1st. In the meantime my roommate moved out around February 20th and neither me nor my other roommates saw or heard anything from her. Her room was empty and clean and all her stuff removed from the common bathroom and kitchen. A few days ago the soon-to-be roommate asked me if He could store some boxes in the empty room already. I told him yes. Yesterday out of nowhere I got a message from my roommate who moved out that she has seen that I rented her room to another person and taking the rent double (which I didnt and I told her so) and that I violated her privacy letting strangers put stuff in her room. She demands her rent for March back. I apologized to her for not asking before letting the soon-to-be roommate put stuff in her room and me and the other roommates moved it out to the common areas, but I told her that I will not be paying back her rent, cause there is no double-renting and there was no (financial) damage or anything else and her privacy was not really violated because there was literally nothing in the room. Now she says I am an AH. I know it was legally wrong to put stuff in there while she's actually renting the room and I feel really sorry for not asking her about it, but I honestly didnt think much of it since we handled everything in this flat on an informal basis before. I honestly thought she would be okay with it and since she wasnt I apoligized and moved everything out. So I was a bad communicator, but AITA?"
40,2021-03-17 06:06:55,Asshole,17,m6jfx3,19,WIBTA If I said I want to give our cat away,"I feel like the asshole anyway but here we go. I (23F) live with a friend (24F) and my mom. I have always said that I love cats and would love to have one or two in the future when I’m more financially and emotionally stable (both things I’m far from being right now), it has always been an on going talk about how great cats are so my friend peaked on my interest and decided to look into cats to adopt. last week she shared a pic of a beautiful baby cat that needed a home and how we should go for it, my mom said she would love to and I didn’t say anything. My friend got the cat. Here is the thing. I really do love cats but I think they are a big responsibility and I have a lot in my plate right now, when Pepper (my cat) got home I loved her and was really excited, my friend told us the total of the bills she spent for their basic needs and we split it between the three of us, now I’m the only one working from home and I never leave the house during the week (that’s the main reason my mom wanted the cat, she read it would be good for my mental state) and Pepper wants to spend every second of the day with me, at first I had no problem but today she ripped my sheets accidentally and wouldn’t let me take a nap before work and I got really anxious and I know it is not Pepper’s fault, she is just a baby and needs attention. To be honest I’m not sure if I can give Pepper the attention she needs? Specially now that I started Uni again ( I have online classes from 7 to 13, and work from 15 to 21 hrs) Then my friend said we needed to send her the money for the vaccines and extra stuff and I was like holy shit I barely make it to the end of the month with my salary how am I going to support this tiny cat? So now I’m very anxious about both money and having to take care of Pepper the whole day (both my friend and my mom are gone from 9am to 8pm and my friend sleeps at her boyfriend most nights) so I was thinking of giving her away but it makes me feel really guilty just thinking about it and I know my friend is gonna be upset because is her cat too and I was the one who always talked about wanting a cat. So would I be the asshole?"
41,2021-03-17 07:51:20,Asshole,10,m6lopn,70,AITA for analyzing why my friend likes a guy?,"So my friend \[16F\] and I \[16M\] were watching a new TV show. The TV show has a love triangle, basically the classic nice guy vs bad boy type thing going-- the former is popular, friendly, a good student, etc, the latter is kind of an outcast, moody, confusing, traumatized, etc. You get the idea. A lot of girls prefer the latter. I guessed that was more due to the latter being played by a more attractive actor than the former but figured I'd watch the show to see what the appeal was. My friend fell in the 'latter guy is hot and I hate the first guy' camp. I didn't, really-- neither guy was perfect, but I felt like the first guy was just better-- the latter guy just seemed like a whiney fuckboy while the former seemed more chill, nice, and dependable. Maybe my opinion was influenced by me being straight and not being influenced by looks lol. Either way after the show was over, my friend was gushing about the latter guy, and I was curious what she saw in him, so I asked. She explained, saying the former guy never did anything for her and this guy did a lot. I found this interesting because empirically this wasn't true and the latter guy did a lot of bad things to her as well. So I brought that up and she handwaved it all away.This was very interesting to me-- she was ignoring huge parts of the show where the former guy does do stuff for the main character and also the parts where the latter guy was acting negatively, so it doesn't seem like her assessment of the guys was on a purely logical basis, as she ignored the facts, but there's something else that makes her like the guy and she's trying to come up with a logical explanation-- maybe his looks, maybe something about his personality. I'm not sure. I said this and she got mad at me.AITA? I was just thinking out loud, and she's pissed at me."
42,2021-03-17 04:28:17,Asshole,21,m6h6xa,74,AITA for asking a fast food employee for a cookie?,"The other day I was going through the drive thru at a fast food restaurant. I ordered my normal meal and paid for it at the first window, but when I got to the second window, the girl working there told me that they were out of the bread they use for the thing that I ordered. She offered that they could use a different kind instead, and even though it was frustrating, I said that was fine. When I was waiting for the food to be ready though I realized that the bread I was getting instead is way cheaper than what I paid for. So when she opened the window to give me my food, I asked if they could give me something extra like a cookie or an ice cream to make up for the fact that I got screwed over. The girl got kind of upset about this and walked away from the window without even saying anything to me and then what turned out to be the manager came to the window and asked me what was going on. I explained my request and she looked kind of angry but there was a giant line behind me so she went ahead and gave me a cookie. As I was about to pull away from the window I'm almost positive I got a glimpse of the girl who I orignially asked and I'm like 90% sure she was crying. I dont think what I did was mean or even an absurd request and I dont know if she was crying because of me but both employees seemed to be upset/angry at the very least. I'm honestly kind of scared to go back to that restaurant because of this. AITA?"
43,2021-03-17 01:20:28,Asshole,30,m6ct5x,19,AITA for snapping at my sister about her constant talking?,"Me (21f) and my sister (19) are very close. She has always had anxiety issues that have kinda limited her from make many friends, so a lot of my friends are her friends and love her. I’m not sure why but I don’t think she feels like they like her enough to cope with her for long periods of time. She has hinted at this.So here’s where this whole thing comes in. She is constantly speaking. She talks nonstop even when there’s nothing to talk about, and her words are usually just a nonsensical flow of words from a caffeine addicted adhd teenager. It’s been getting to be a lot over the last year, with lockdown she’s gotten so much worse. I’ve started dropping hints without hurting her feelings, at first just saying things like “you really do talk a lot huh” and not really replying to some things but she didn’t get it. A week ago we were on a 4 hour road trip and there was maybe 20 minutes of silence the whole time. At one point I just exploded. I told her that she knows that I’m not interested in the things she goes on for hours about and does she know that she can be quite irritating when she does things like that and a couple other things. I feel so bad but I think it needed to be said. I do love her but I walk on eggshells around her because she’s quite sensitive and we don’t really fight at all because of it. I can’t keep going like this. It’s gotten to the point that I think it’s jeopardising our relationship. She’s not talking to me and my family is furious. I might have just ruined our relationship anyways.Edit: thank you to everyone who has replied. I just thought I should add some extra information. Both my sister and I are in therapy. We grew up in an abusive household and because of it I have a very low emotional intelligence and I suspect that this rambling of hers is a trauma response. I know that my low eq doesn’t excuse my behaviour, but it’s tough for me to confront people in a normal healthy way and I would risk my life to avoid confrontation. I totally get that I’m the asshole here"

It ended for an array of different reasons but the main one being that he would not come out. Since then, we have only talked about four times all through fb messenger.During the breakup when I was moving out and getting all my things, we had a friend nearby. She was okay with us dropping things off for the other to pick up. This was a really great arrangement as we both ended up finding odds and ends while packing/unpacking.Well, my ex decided to stay in our old apartment until the lease ran out. Our friend and her fiancé helped him move, and my ex ended up having to leave couple things at our friends place. Over the past few weeks since he's moved out I've gone to visit our friend a few times. And every time that I do there is a bunch of wine glasses and mugs on their counter. When I ask about them, my friend has told me that they were left there because when he moved out he didn't have a proper box for them. Not only that, she had messaged my ex a few times asking if he would be picking them up, and he had not answered.This is where I may be the asshole.I knew if I messaged him asking if I could have them he might be more inclined to pick them up. So I messaged him asking if he was planning on getting them. His immediate response was to ask why I was messaging him about it. To which I told him I may call dibs if he doesn't take them. I knew he already has 4 wineglasses, I was actually being serious about taking them if he didn't. He was quick to say no, and to go off on a rant about how he just gotten his second covid shot, and hasn't had the energy to get them. He continued on about how I've treated him since the breakup ( unfriending him, just outright avoiding running into him, etc). I chose not to answer these messages, and because I didn't message him back, he sarcastically thanked me for ghosting him again. I then promptly blocked him because I had had enough of him being bitter and rude. I believe I may be the asshole for the reason that I messaged him in the first place. TLDR:// My ex has left wineglasses and mugs at our friends place that has been sitting on their counter for a few weeks now. I messaged my ex to say if he didn't want to get them I would call dibs. He was very angry, at both me and my friend."

I hang out a lot with her brother (17m) playing playstation at theirs (they have a sick media room setup) when I'm over but my gf's otherwise engaged. Anyway sometime last week me and gf's bro were playing FIFA when he kinda asked me for my advice.  He said there's this girl that he's been talking to and texting a lot and that he really likes her and is always taking her on dates and buying her flowers and shit but that recently things have tapered off. She seems less and less interested and hasn't replied to any of his most recent messages despite being online. He also told me that he was probably gonna see her at a party on Saturday and asked me what he should say to get her.I basically told him a strategy that my rugby captain in high school taught me which is the ignore strategy. Basically, find a girl who you like and tell her you like her and then ignore her. Focus on practically everyone else but her, flirt with her friends and people where she might see and just focus on having fun. She will start to like you more because you ignore her. Eventually when she confronts you about ignoring her like she's entitled to your attention just kiss her. If that doesn't work go back to ignoring her and either she'll come around or there was no chance at all anyway. Since he's already bought her shit step 1's outta the way and the party is the perfect opportunity for step 2 and 3.Today I'm at gf's house and see bro and he tells me that it worked. GF who was in the room asks what worked and he tells her. She was pissed at both of us, me for apparently teaching her brother to be a misogynist and him for listening. He blew up back shouting that my advice lost him his virginity to one of the hottest girls in his school. I laughed my ass off due to the absurdity of the situation which only made gf madder. I had to leave to do some shit but now gf isn't answering my texts and her bro texted me to say I'm his hero which lol.   So AITA"

I am doing better (I emigrated to a better country and I work in finance).For every occasion (birthday, Christmas, Easter, etc) my mom spends a lot of money in gifts for me. From one side I am flattened. However, I have two problems with this. 1)I am conscious that is a lot of money for her 2)lot of times, the gift is stupid, i.e. crap worth 10$ sold 100$ in some commercial etc and stuff that I would never use. She is my favourite person in the world and I tried several times to told her to give me less that for me is more the pleasure to receive any gift rather than how much she spend but she continue to do the same.Today, I had a particular tough day (work pressure, general depression for lockdown) and I receive a gift that is useless and for which she spent a lot. Most of the money was spent for the shipping so is not even something that I can return to receive a coupon for something that I like and/or give back to her. We had a call and I had a bit of a breakdown because I am really tired of this situation.I feel a selfish piece of sh\*t because nothing could be done to fix the situation (for this specific gift at least) but now in addition I also offended her/make her cry.

Well, today I posted a video in a series and the skit went something like this:Client: “can you produce my song?”Me: “I’d love to!”Client: “Great! I need x and x and x done to it, which will take you a long time... and I need it in a week” (which is not enough time for me to do those things well) Me: *insert panic face*This client I have is CONVINCED that I made this video about them. I explained that I didn’t, that it’s a hyperbolic scenario, but they weren’t taking that for an answer. They tore into me about how my actions on social media will make them look bad and that’s it’s a really shitty feeling to have. At first I was mad. It feels very entitled to assume that the content I make for a wide audience is about you when it so clearly is not even close. And then to take my videos so personally? It feels like a slap in the face. I also just don’t agree that my fairly popular content channel is going to reflect badly on this person.So I answered: “I’m sorry you feel that way!”That was probably a mistake. Cue the many messages about how I’m an asshole, how no one cares about my content or my career, and that I’ve shown my true colors to them. They texted me a bit ago and I’m pretty sure I’m about to get dropped from a paid project. They didn’t accept my apology. But part of me wonders if they’re right... social media can reflect poorly on a person if they aren’t careful. I guess I could work harder to create content that wouldn’t offend anyone or make anyone upset, but I’ve been trying for a very long time and this is the best I’ve got. I’m used to hate on the internet, but it’s always been from strangers and never from someone I knew personally. So I kept making the videos. I even gave them a client appreciation post.I haven’t heard from them in a few days but I can’t shake the feeling that I’m in the wrong here. AITA?TLDR I make super niche social media content. Client thought it was about them (it clearly wasn’t) and is very likely dropping me from a paid projectEDIT FOR CLARITY: After the first interaction, I gave another apology over the phone. That is the one that wasn’t accepted. The first one doesn’t count as an apology. Also, they are my client for music production- we make music together and it’s awesome! I produce and mix the tracks. I have much respect for them as an artist and friend and I can’t believe they went straight to thinking that this video was about them."
48,2021-03-16 05:32:07,Asshole,277,m5u50d,199,AITA for not saying “I love you” back to my stepsister when I say it back to my little brother?,"Oftentimes before my little brother (4m) goes to sleep he will say “I love you” to everyone before he does it. It’s his thing. Don’t know why he started doing it, but I of course say it back to him when he comes up to me and says it.However now my stepsister (5f) has started to follow his lead. It makes me very uncomfortable as she and my stepdad are newly added members of our family. They’re okay, but if I’m being honest I do not love either one of them. So when she started saying “I love you” to me I would reply back with “that’s nice” or “thank you”She’s started to get upset because I say “I love you” back to my brother, but never to to her. My mom and stepdad say it’s not such a big deal for me to just say it even if I don’t mean it, but that it hurts her a lot for me not to say it. They don’t want there to be issues about anyone feeling less in the family. Saying it still feels wrong to me though."
49,2021-03-16 09:56:27,Asshole,104,m5x1pv,121,AITA for allowing my 4y/o daughter to go on a last minute vacation with her dad?,"So for starters, I'm on mobile and I've never posted here before so I apologize in advance for any format or spelling errors. This scenario just happened (is still happening??)So I (23F) share a 4y/o daughter that we will call ""A"" with ""T"" (24M). We share joint 50/50 custody. About 4 hours ago, he texted me asking if we can postpone my scheduled days with her this week, because him and his girlfriend ""L"" (23F) planned a last minute vacation to Florida for them, ""A"", and her little sister ""S"" (who is the daughter of L.) We live in Indiana, if that matters. They have tickets to Orlando Studios. At first I wanted to say no. That he needed to bring her to me and leave A behind with me. She has never been out of state before, let alone a trip that big. But I thought about it before I responded. I thought ""who am I to hold my daughter back and force her to miss out on a great experience just because I'm scared?"" So I gave T the greenlight. All I asked, was that he try to give me updates on their way there, and let me know when they arrived in Orlando so that way I could know that they made it safely. I talked to my daughter on the phone and told her that I loved her and to be a good girl and to have so much fun. Here is where I may be the asshole (was made to feel like the asshole.)  I called my mom (43F) and told her what was going on, to keep her updated on her grandchild. My mom instantly got upset and told me she was going to hang up. So I let her. She then was texting me, telling me that I make the dumbest choices for my daughter. That I never listen to anyone when it comes to what is right for my daughter... Things like that. I feel like I may be the asshole for letting my 4 year old go all the way across the country to a place she's never been and not ""taking her safety into consideration"". In my childhood, I never got to experience anything fun. I've never been to Florida. I've been to Chicago, and Sandusky, OH. And that's it. I want my daughter to grow up creating exciting memories that she will always get to reminisce on. She's only 4, yes, but she is a very smart little girl and still talks about things that happened when she was 2. So I know this will be an experience that she will never forget. But on the other hand, am I being reckless in my decision making for my child? Should I have said no? If anything bad happens on this trip I will never be able to forgive or live with myself. She is my whole entire world. My whole heart. But I dont want to hold her back her whole entire life just because I'm scared. And I trust her dad and his girlfriend completely. I'm just torn. I knew my mom would be upset but her words really got to me. So, what do you guys think? AITA for letting my 4y/o go on a last minute vacation with her dad, his girlfriend, and her little sister?"
50,2021-03-16 02:35:12,Asshole,407,m5q3uw,175,AITA for saying that my sister’s boyfriend of six months isn’t her “partner”?,"This issue involves my (32F) sister “Maddie” (21F) and her boyfriend “Carson” (19M). Maddie is in school and lives in an off-campus apartment. She started dating Carson about six months ago, he’s not a student. My honest opinion is that he’s a deadbeat — he works part time only, he’s baked or drunk 24/7, and he moved into my sister’s apartment when they’d only been dating four months. He doesn’t help with rent either. As mentioned in the title, Maddie has been calling him her “partner” lately, and it drives me up the wall. To me, a partner is someone you have a long term commitment with, like a common-law. For example, our auntie Kate  uses it to refer to her long term boyfriend, my Uncle Dan, and they’ve been together for almost thirty years. Carson doesn’t have any kind of life partnership with my sister, they don’t have kids together, and they don’t even pay rent jointly. She just subsidizes his shit.Well, it’s coming up on the four year anniversary of my cousin’s death (backstory isn’t relevant, just know that it’s an occasion for our family to gather). My family usually goes to the butterfly garden, as butterflies were her fave thing before she passed. Due to COVID, only 8 people are allowed in the garden at a time. My aunt decided to invite my Auntie Kate and Uncle Dan, my parents, my grandma, Maddie, and me. Maddie pitched a fit that her “partner” Carson wasn’t invited, while my Uncle Dan was. I thought it was very insensitive of her to attack my aunt like that. As the person most affected, I think my aunt has every right to invite who she wants to her daughter’s memorial event. Also, there’s a huge difference between my Auntie Kate’s relationship and Maddie’s.I shared all that in the chat, and Maddie called me the “relationship gatekeeper.” I stopped engaging after that.AITA for calling my sister out and thinking it’s stupid for her to consider her bf of 6 months a “partner”?"
51,2021-03-17 00:59:26,Asshole,5,m6cbco,61,AITA for letting my (F22) boyfriend (23) stay at mine and my brother’s (23) place most of the time?,"TLDR at the bottom.I moved away from my country home to the big city to study. My parents have been paying my rent while I’m studying to help support me. I wanted to move in with my bf (K) but my parents said my bro (B) is going to move to study as well. They’re prepared to pay my brother’s rent so it made sense to them to have us live in the same place. I asked B if he would let K live with us after a few months of him settling in and he said he would think about it. I’ve been living out of home for 4 years, I’m my own adult now. I wanted to move in with my boyfriend because we felt our relationship was naturally moving that direction. K works as a chef and does anywhere between 8-13 hour days 5-6 days a week. He’s gone all day and the only times I get to see him are in the mornings, before we go to bed or on his days off. B is studying and looking for a job. Otherwise he’s home all the time and plays games. Before he moved to the city he lived at home with my parents, only working or playing games. He could have saved enough money by now to afford rent at his own place. He should have secured a job before moving to the city so he wasn’t in a bind. My parents are paying the complete rent at our place, and sending him an allowance each week to live. My boyfriends housemates are complete fucking slobs and he hates living there. His work is only 10-15 minutes drive from mine so it works out for him to stay at mine during his work week. But he ends up staying most of the time. K and I have no ulterior motive like making him stay over so B feels pressured to let him live with us. It’s just how life has been working out lately.B’s main argument is that K doesn’t talk to him during the time they are both in the house. K is tired all the time and doesn’t want to bother B so he tries to stay out of the way as much as he can. B is raised on old fashioned values of “guests must greet the man of the house and make small talk” even though K can take a while to warm up to people and doesn’t feel comfortable talking to B after the drama of him being pushed aside for my bro to live with me. All of this boiled up to an argument between B and I and I told him I never wanted to live with him, I tried to be a good sister by helping him settle in. I also said I felt like I had no choice because our parents pay my rent and I was worried they would stop paying it if I said no. I only have 1 semester of uni left and am looking into part time/full time work so they don’t have to anymore. After the massive argument B and I had, I’m wondering if I’ve been doing the wrong thing by having K stay over all the time. Am I being unreasonable in asking that my brother understand K’s situation? TLDR: originally wanted to live with my bf but my bro moved in instead. BF works 12 hour days so I only see him in the morning/night. He’s been staying over 5/6 days a week and bro is pissed because bf doesn’t talk to him.Edit: thanks for the judgements everyone. I’ve realised I was the asshole. I fucked up and it’s my own fault for living off my parents instead of paying my own rent. I’m going to apologise to my bro. My bf said he won’t stay over anymore so I won’t get to see him much but that’s just how it has to happen I guess. I’m going to work and save money to move out."
52,2021-03-16 13:22:12,Asshole,50,m60uzz,65,AITA for asking the artist to change the angle?,"Sorry for the weird title. I commissioned an artist recently. Pleased bear with me as this is my first time commissioning an artist and I also don’t know much about how art works.Anyway they gave me a rough sketch yesterday and I said it looks perfect so far. So they said awesome glad you like it so far and that was it. Today they gave me a much more detailed sketch. This took me by surprise because they didn’t even ask if I wanted to change anything. Keep in mind I didn’t *explicitly* say “I approve of this and you can continue” but they assumed so anyways. So at that point I was kind ticked, but I see the misunderstanding. since it’s still at the sketch stage they said they allow free changes until lineart so i asked for a small change. How do I put this into words… basically I feel like the “camera” angle was off. So I just asked them if they could shift the scene some so that the angle was more front facing forward and a bit from above angle (my character). The pose and everything would stay the same so I feel this is not a big change at all.But then they told me I have to pay $20 for them to make this edit. I asked why when they said they will do free edits? And they told me “that’s not an edit that’s redoing the whole scene”. Which I don’t get at all because everything in the scene the same I just need them to shift it for me. This is pretty upset because I’m already paying $125 for this art and that’s basically like 25% of what I paid to do a SKETCH. So currently I’m refusing to pay for that until they agree to do it. The one thing big I have over them is their TOS which explicitly said “free edits during sketch” so they literally cannot argue against me. I have been wanting art from them a long time and $125 is a lot I want it to be perfect so I’m not going to back down easily. AITA?"
53,2021-03-16 13:36:41,Asshole,43,m612z9,41,AITA for excluding my sibling," Earlier in the day, my sibling and I had a disagreement. For some background, my sibling and I have been debating this topic for a long time. Today, he made such outrageous claims that my sister and I decided he had crossed a line. It eventually got out of hand, so my sister and I left the house to grab a snack. Usually we would get some for everyone, but we decided not to get him any (petty, I know, but we were still heated over the argument). When my parents learned this they were very upset and said we were being unfair. We explained that it was because he was making ignorant and offensive remarks. My parents said its obviously unfair to exclude someone just for having opposing beliefs and that our beliefs shouldn't get in the way of family. They said his beliefs were based on misinformation and that we should work to correct him rather than excluding him. They also said it was not our place to judge and should not have tried to get ""revenge"" with food. We attempted to explain that we just wanted to cool off but they said the fact that we didn't get him any proves it was just for petty revenge.  We have tried to teach him many times, sometimes hours on end. I feel like we've tried enough to educate him, but he still says we're just tainted by media. My parents say that he's still not an adult holds no responsibility for his beliefs and told my sister she should have stayed impartial in the argument.AITA?"
54,2021-03-17 06:04:59,Asshole,4,m6je9g,92,AITA For making a joke about my friend’s dead mom?,"A bit of background: A little over a year ago one of my friends, Jessica (not her real name) mom died. It was a little unexpected at the time since an undetected brain tumor was the cause. Jessica and I weren’t also great friends but peers United from mutual friends.The story: So about a week ago Jessica, three other kids, and I all went to a park. We were mostly messing around passing time as teenagers do. Our intellectual conversation at the time soon develops into a display of intense Yo mama jokes. Jessica at the time was dishing out Yo mama jokes like COVID in America. She thought because her mom had passed away she had free rain to as many Yo mama jokes without any retaliation, and I thought so too. This all ended when she started using more personal material.I then stepped in and exclaimed, “You think your invincible from Yo mama jokes, well we will se about that. She looked at me interested as I wounded up this soul crushing jab. “Yo mama so fat, they had to put her ashes inside of a shipping container.” You could see the emotion drain from her face before she stormed off, and as quickly as it started our conversation ended. I thought I was the hero but as it turns out, my friend’s thought I was a dick, and Jessica thought that way too. They urged me to apologize to her for what I said but I feel as if I shouldn’t have to. AITA?"
55,2021-03-15 22:33:13,Asshole,619,m5krxn,184,AITA for buying my husband a shirt with his fathers quote on it?,"My husband and I are going through some marital issues but we are committed to working it out. One issue we have is his family and him prioritizing his dad and sister over our nuclear family.In the past we had a lot of issues with MIL. As of right now we ignore her and she ignores us. We haven’t really interacted outside of hi bye in five years and it works out great, but before we got the issues under control, we tried going no contact with her.FIL said that was our choice but “my wife is the center of my life. Everything else is a distant second.” and said he would make time for us if he could but she was his priority and NC with her might been low contact with him.Honestly they both suck but I think that quote is marriage goals. I printed it out on a shirt and gifted it to DH (more as a reminder I didn’t expect him to wear it in public) He got very offended and said that I was using his personal pain to be petty. It really hurts him that his dad always puts his mom first, but I didn’t think of that when I did it. Now he is mad and feels like it was a selfish thing to do."
56,2021-03-16 12:58:29,Asshole,40,m60gxb,19,AITA for telling my brother to get his shit together and stop being a lazy POS?,"Ok, so a bit of background. I’m a 29 year old man living on his own with a stable career and a growing side business. My brother (soon to be 23), is still living with my parents. He still hasn’t finished school (he attends community college) studying computer science. He’s supposed to transfer after finishing his AA, which he keeps saying that he has one more class, but he doesn’t. The same thing happens every semester that passes. I honestly don’t think that he’s even doing anything. Almost three years ago he lost his license after a DUI and hasn’t even made an effort to get it back ever since. I’ve bailed him out a couple of times prior to this. He usually spends all day in his room playing online games. Only coming out to get something to eat or make some food. He says that he’s taking online classes (he’s a computer science major). He’s even asked me for money to take a couple of classes. Which I loaned him for but I’m starting to think that he’s not telling me the truth. Which in this case would be just as good as stealing. He isolated himself from the family and it shows in his interactions with us. He often lashes out at everyone in the family and seems to be passive aggressive towards us. Everytime we call him out, he gets defensive and often retorts to excuse making and deflecting. He’d bring up our past slights towards him. He quit his part time job over three years ago and hasn’t tried to find a job ever since. One of my brothers also told me that the reason why he quit his job (to this day, the only job he’s ever held) was because he couldn’t talk to his friends. I mean, dude it’s work. Of course you can’t talk to your friends. I think that he doesn’t have a sense of what the real world is like. Trust me, when I’m at my job (I work as an accountant and small business owner), I don’t have much time to use reddit, let alone talk to my friends. One time in a fit of anger, I told him to man the fuck up and get your shit together for once you lazy POS. I told him what a disappointment he was becoming. He has a Mensa level (140+) IQ, so much talent and potential that he’s basically continuing to squander. I mean this guy could be working at google developing apps if he had my work ethic. In school he got A’s and A+ without trying while I had to work my ass off for A’s and B’s as my IQ isn’t anything to write home about. He’s a Mensa candidate while I struggled with learning disabilities and was in special ed for a good portion of my school years. Admittedly, my dad has always been especially hard on him because of his talents, which may have caused some self-esteem and motivational problems. After dropping out of pre-med, their relationship seems to only have gotten worse. My brother also thinks that my dad favors me, which isn’t true. He’s always accused my dad of favoritism, when in reality it’s because actively work hard in order to get the things I want. I’m not trying to belittle him or show how superior I am to him. I just want to get him back onto the right track."

Every couple days or so I've been asking if it's in yet, we talk quite a bit in between as well. Today he told me ""Your not allowed to ask, it's rude that you only message me for gifts"". He also said that I will open it at his house with him, my stepmom and my older biological brother. I hate my stepmom and that household is extremely toxic because of it. AITA?Edit : Thank you all for being honest, I thought I was the asshole, and know I know I am. Sorry if my story made you angry or thinking of me as a spoiled brat.

58,2021-03-16 01:24:17,Asshole,239,m5ogug,105,AITA for not paying my mom back?,"My mom and I are having a lighthearted debate and we want some objective perspective.About a year ago, my mom wanted me to have a dentist appointment. I didn't want to for two reasons: (1) I take immaculate care of my teeth, and have no history of problems, and (2) I had terrible student insurance that would have cost me $400 for the checkup. My mom offered to pay if I would go, so I went to make her happy and she paid.Months later, I found out that a school program will reimburse preventative medical and dental check ups. I applied and received a complete refund of the $400. I did not give that money back to my mom. She thinks I should. My opinion is she paid for me to see the dentist that I found a reimbursement mechanism and pursued it myself was outside the scope of our deal. Am I the asshole for not giving her back the money?"
59,2021-03-16 02:54:04,Asshole,143,m5qjbj,184,AITA for getting upset when my gf showed an old pic of herself to my friend?,"Throwaway for the usual reasons. I (35M) have been dating Emma (29F) for about 4 months now. Recently, she met some of my close friends in person for the first time because we are all vaccinated now (she and I live across the hall from each other and both work from home so we were in the same bubble before being vaccinated). She was telling my friend Amanda one of her travel stories and showed her a picture on her phone of what she was talking about and I was bothered about it, and here’s why.Full disclosure, Emma is drop dead gorgeous. Just a full on natural beauty, shiny blonde hair, large blue eyes, pretty smile, perfect hourglass figure...basically looks wise my dream girl and easily the most attractive girl I’ve ever been in a relationship with. However, from ages 16-27, she had a very short pixie cut. I don’t know what it is, but I absolutely hate this hairstyle. In my opinion it’s one of the least attractive things a woman can do to herself. I would never tell a random woman on the street or even one I know that I think she looks bad, obviously, but privately I cringe when I see short hair on an attractive girl. My close friends know I don’t like it, though. Emma has had hair about 6 inches past her shoulders since I’ve known her, and when I saw an old picture of her when we were first dating I asked about it and she said she’d probably never cut it again because it was a pain to grow out.After Amanda and my other friends left, I was still internally cringing at the old picture and I decided to just say something about it. In the most gentle way I could I asked her if she could be a little more discreet about showing pictures of herself with short hair, because it’s really important to me that my friends see her in the most flattering light. She got really mad, and told me it’s her past she’s sharing, and I have no right to tell her what she can and can’t say about herself. She insists that she was just as attractive when her hair was short and got just as much male attention. I tried to just let her vent so she could calm down but she’s still barely talking to me. AITA?edit: I didn’t tell her or demand she didn’t show those pictures, I was just so bothered by it (I’m weird, I know) that I really nicely asked and she lost it"
60,2021-03-16 11:22:34,Asshole,25,m5yrom,21,AITA for using my roommates security deposit for his half of the last months prorated rent when neither of us have lived there for 1.5 months?,"I (23M) was put in a difficult roomate situation this past year. I moved in with a college classmate and friend (26M) after receiving a job close to his current rental residence thats he’s been staying at for 2 years (Jan 20’). We signed a 2 month agreement with the landlord until March and then a 1 year agreement again that would end the end of March in 21’. His old roommates got out of the previous lease and I subbed in. It was just us two on the lease for a 3 bedroom and we quickly looked for a third roomate(26M) who stayed with us mar-dec 20’. Split the rent/utilities 1/3 during that time. In September my roomate decided to buy a house after selling his corvette for him and his girlfriend. It was at this time he notified me he would be moving out in mid December after renovating his house and asked that I start looking for new roommates to cover his rent. At this point I was a little annoyed that he wouldn’t offer to cover the rest of rent or look for roommates but agreed to help him out. His other offer was to email the landlord to try and end the lease. Landlord replied that once the unit was empty and refurbished he would put it up on the market so we could get out a little early possibly but this is all he could do. I found 2 other guys I lived with previous and I started looking for houses as well for me and the roommates that needed a new place. Fast forward to December and I find a house, place an offer, and get a close date of January 8th. At this point my roomate makes a request to the landlord to remove him from the lease and this is denied. He moves out December 31st allowing my new roommates 1 day to move in as their lease ends the same day. Then 8 days later we start the move to my new house and the apartment is completely clean and moved out by the 15th. My roommates and I pay the apartment rent for January and February as it is vacant as my mortgage has not started yet. End of feb I request the last month to be payed by my original roomate after I had paid my 1/2. He denies this request and I sent a couple choice words back at him and he questions my morals for even asking as he is out of the lease sense December. At this point I make a request to the landlord to take the remaining balance from his security deposit and send me the rest. AITA?Addition:TLDR: With 7 months left on lease roomate requested I fill his spot as he bought a house and would move out in 4 months. I agreed found 2 roommates (3bdroom). Month 4 I find a house and move out of apartment 15 after my roomate leaving apartment vacant for 2.5 months. New roommates come with me to new house. I pay 1.5 months and request payment for last prorated month as unit is vacant. Roomate denies and I use security deposit."
61,2021-03-16 04:22:45,Asshole,67,m5sl30,64,AITA for telling my wife to not complain about a wrong size toilet seat?,"First post, please forgive formatting/technical issues. Wife requested/reviewed/approved post.My (26M) wife (25F) and I live in an apartment that handles all maintenance requests, such as light bulb changes, etc.. Recently, our toilet seat became partially detached from the toilet itself. We put in a low priority maintenance request for the toilet seat and the technician showed up a few minutes ago. He was very polite and looked at the toilet seat before leaving to go get a replacement. Due to the pandemic my wife and I stayed in our bedroom while he was working, and when he finished he called out to us letting us know he was leaving. Before he left, we looked at the new seat and noticed that it was too long for our actual toilet, causing the seat to jut out about 2 inches from the rim of the bowl. It is definitely noticeable and unsightly, but functionally fine. My wife immediately told me to go stop the man from leaving and ask for a seat that fit our toilet. At this point, I thought to myself that the maintenance tech is not really at fault for the toilet seat not fitting and that it would probably be a lot of time and energy to get a seat that fit our toilet. I figured the man had done the job we asked of him, and that I'd run to the store later and fix it myself. Wanting to avoid conflict, I asked my wife to let it go and said ""don't be a Karen"". She told me that this is a service we pay for, and that I needed to self-advocate and let the man know there was a problem with the seat. She then got up to go talk to the man herself and I repeated ""Please, don't be a Karen"". By this time, the man had already left and my wife grabbed her laptop to file an additional maintenance request about the seat not fitting. I told her that we should wait a week before filing an additional request so as not to anger the maintenance techs, and giving me time to try and fix it myself. She said that we shouldn't be responsible for buying an additional seat and I was being unreasonable for not just indicating that we had a problem, either in person or on the request form. I know I'm TA for the Karen comments, and have apologized/been forgiven, so please don't debate that too much as I already accept I was wrong. The question is AITA for not telling the maintenance tech there is an issue with our toilet seat/not letting my wife do so?"
62,2021-03-16 01:13:27,Asshole,114,m5o7vt,82,AITA if I refuse to payback a loan from my parents?,"I’m a 22m who had to borrow $700 from my dad because I was short on a down deposit for my new apartment. I am moving for a job but didn’t have enough to pay out of pocket because I’ve been on unemployment and had to purchase new (used) car, however I’ll be fine once I start the job in two weeks. The issue is my parents claimed me as a dependent on their taxes so they have gotten stimulus checks for me. I think I should get at least part of the money seeing as the past 4 years I’ve lived on my own, worked full time while at Uni (which I took out loans to pay for), payed my own rent, etc. With 0 help from them (which I don’t mind). I just think it’s unfair that I’m cheated out of the stimulus money because my parents claim me as a dependent since I’m on my Dads health insurance.However, inbetween my apartments I’ve been living at home the past three months but move out in a week. My parents say since I’ve been living here (which was their idea to sublet my apartment and save money until I found a new job) that they deserve the stimulus check because I’ve been costing them. I said that I didn’t care about the entire check, Id just want my dad to forgive my loan or at least part of it because they are getting $1400 for claiming me as a dependent (Not even taking to account the first stimulus check they got money for me). I know i’ve costed my parents some grocery money but I’ve also bought groceries a couple times and we have different diets (I’m vegan) so I make all my own meals and clean up after myself.AITA if I refuse to pay my Dad back for the entire loan or am I being a spoiled brat? My friends are on my side but every discussion with my parents basically devolves into a screaming match so I’m starting to get conflicted."
63,2021-03-17 02:26:38,Asshole,0,m6ed2y,18,WIBTA if I pointed out to someone that they haven’t “made it” on the Instagram explore page?,"Someone I know runs their own business & has an Instagram page which their business mostly relies on for nearly all their new custom as the service & work is something visual.They are really good, have a high number of followers & get engagement & should be proud of themselves. However recently they’ve taken to making official announcements that they’ve “made it” on to Instagram’s Explore page which shows a mix of posts from lots of different accounts. And they keep doing it writing things like “We’ve done it again!” & showing a screenshot of how they’ve made it. The issue is - they haven’t actually made it anywhere. The Explore page is personalised to every user to show the kinds of pages you interact with, the kind of stuff you like & the kind of stuff your friends are liking. It looks completely different for everyone & can feature anyone with an open account that IG detects you have a connection with through your algorithm. So your aunt Susan’s photo of her pie can be seen by your friends on their Explore page if you’ve liked it. Now, obviously this is making them happy & whilst there’s no harm done, it’s kind of making me cringe inside for them as they’re announcing it like formal awards & most people know what the Explore page is & we just go on there to stumble upon more of what we like & memes. We know Instagram hasn’t specifically chosen to showcase these accounts on their merit & that we all see different random stuff. So people may be laughing at them, rolling their eyes or even discrediting their actual achievements based on that. They would be better off concentrating on their engagement & celebrating that. WIBTA if I quietly let them know they haven’t been chosen by Instagram to feature on a page they think is special?"
64,2021-03-17 09:40:40,Asshole,0,m6nvhg,11,AITA For asking for an apology?,"  Hi everyone! Before I begin, I apologize if this seems incredibly petty, but I need to get it off my chest and I NEED outside unbiased opinions. The other person involved in this also uses reddit (and heavily this sub) so I won't be surprised if he sees this (hence throwaway). I also truly will try and be as un-biased in this story as possible.Anyway, so I (24m) have a friend Sam (24m) who's leaving for the national guard (in the US) the day after Easter. My friend Sam, understandably, is trying to spend as much time with the people he cares about before leaving and going no contact for 6 months. I, of course, will miss him greatly and am one of those people. Another one of those people is his fiancée (24f) Sarah. To be clear, I don't blame her at all for any of this, and her and I are extremely good friends. She's relatively uninvolved in this story.I, also, have recently moved to a new state for work away from my friends and family and have been depressed due to not knowing anyone, and lack of ways to do so because of COVID. Sam knows this, I've told him before how much his friendship means to me and that I'm a bit depressed at the moment. Him, I, and our friend group often play video games at night which is the highlight of my day.I got home a bit early from work and messaged Sam ""Hey, I'll be on in 20 minutes, wanna play?"" He says ""Sure, I'll be on!"". 20 minutes later, I get on, and don't hear from him for a bit. Finally he says ""Won't be on, Sarah cam over, will be on in a couple hours"". This made me feel, honestly, pretty shitty because my best friend basically pushed me to the side like I mattered literally not at all. Maybe I'm just being sensitive because I'm pretty lonely atm, I don't know.To be clear, it's not that I don't think she should be more important to him than me, I just figured that as a friend he'd be a little more respectful of my time and when he says he'll do a thing with me. He does that thing with me. It came to a breaking point when just a few minutes ago he finally came back online like nothing happened. I basically asked him if he felt sorry at all that my feelings were hurt, and the very least he could do was apologize for completely ditching me his response was ""I don't care, why would I care about your feelings?!"" In an extremely condescending tone. I said to him ""all I'm asking for is an apology, not that what you did was wrong, just the word sorry. Can't you just say sorry"" and he says ""absolutely not"" Literally all I wanted was an apology, and I don't think that's a lot to ask for. Even if it's something that he doesn't feel in the wrong for, doesn't he see I'm upset and an apology would make me happy?!Again, I know this sounds petty, but I'm only posting because this is an instance of MANY where he prioritizes her over me (again which is fine, but I'd just like a little sympathy. A scrap of it to make it feel like I even matter at ALL to him).So reddit, AITA for asking for an apology?"
