0,Everyone Sucks,AITA for not sharing son’s investment account with daughter?,5218,m16pyj,1734,"Hey All,My son was born in 2000 and I shortly afterwards opened up an investment account with the intentions of handing it off to him after he graduated college to give him a head start in life.  Wife loved the idea!I put in $10K initially and started adding $100/monthly and the account sits at over $60K today.  A majority of it was just put into mutual funds and some months I’d take the $100 and toss it into riskier stocks that didn’t really pan out.  (Yes I learned my lesson that if you’re not making this a career, just toss it into funds)When our daughter was born 2yrs later I started up an account for her as well.  About a year in, wife & I got drunk with friends and the topic of investing came up.  Wife said something silly along the lines of “anybody can invest” and it became a lengthy discussion at the beach with all our friends chiming in.  In the end, wanted to take over daughters investment account and manage it to show me how easy investing was.  We discussed it at length over the following weeks and she dug her heels in, so i relented and gave her control.  Long story short, that account sits at just over $16K for two reasons: because she picked (bad) individual stocks instead of funds and she wasn’t adding to the account at the start of the month.  Well, we had a blowout fight about a week ago after I mentioned to our son that he was going to inherit a bunch of money once he graduates this spring.  Naturally, our daughter wanted to know if and how much she was going to receive.  I mentioned that of course I’d done the same for her, but she’d have to ask mom as I wasn’t about to be the one to set that ticking time bomb off.  After wife showed the numbers the meltdown happened and then she told our daughter we’d just combine the accounts and split them equally.  At this point I flipped a lid and explained we’d definitely not do that because in her “everybody can invest” BS she’d insulted how difficult investing was and needed to deal with the ramifications of poor choices in investing.We’ve not had a meaningful discussion since, we’ve been cold to one another since, and our daughter is mad at us for the significantly smaller account she stands to inherit.AITA?*EDIT*My wife had full control of the accounts. I would ask her how it's going, and she was telling me the account was doing well. I trusted her, so I did not ask to login to the account to see for myself.*EDIT 2*My son's account had $14.7K in it at the time of the challenge. My daughter's account had roughly $11K in it.*EDIT 3*I’m halfway tempted just to give them each $15K and take the rest and buy myself a new truck seeing as how I’ve become the bad guy.  There, they get the sane amount and I reward myself for successful investing.  Probably the only happy person in this equation then, but I’m mind blown at all the attacks...*EDIT 4*Since most of you say I should just split the two accounts in half...I’ve decided on a fair solution. I will split the money with both kids, but I will give them all the statements from both accounts, and show them that the $37k each they're getting could have been about $60k each if not for their mother's poor investment choices.It’s their money - they have a right to know what happened to it."
1,Everyone Sucks,AITA For thinking I shouldn’t have to move back in with my mom,1227,m13lcc,345,"To start out I’m 17( 6 months away from being 18) my dad is out of the picture and my mom decided to up and leave and go live with her boyfriend  3 months ago.Which is all cool I understand she wanted to be happy after her breast cancer so it wasn’t that big of a deal to me. But I was/ am living alone in a house that my mom pays for, I have a job, make pretty good money for a 17 year old, and have good grades ( A’s and B’s). My mom even asked me to go live with my brother and grandma for a week or two to take care of my grandma because she has dementia and my brother couldn’t handle it anymore. Now the problem is that my mom found out I smoke weed probably 2 -3 times a week 30 minutes before I go to bed (Yes i know it is not good for my memory at all) and she is trying to now make me move in with her and her boyfriend. I told her no I don’t want to and her boyfriend threatened me if I didn’t stay at his house and we got into a huge argument. In my opinion if I’m going to be treated like an adult having to buy my own groceries, having to take care of my grandma, and work, then I think I shouldn’t be punished for smoking a few nights out of the week. My mom thinks I’m completely in the wrong here but I don’t think I am, but I definitely could be I’m not sure ."
2,Everyone Sucks,"AITA I (21,f) told my aunt (47) that maybe if she had a higher education she might know what a drug addiction is",78,m1i616,40,"This event happened 2 years ago but it has recently come up again with my grandparents. I believe my aunt has some serious issues, however my still grandparents think I was mostly in the wrong. My grandpa has back issues which cause him a lot of pain sometimes. That's why when I come over he sometimes asks me if I can bring a joint (weed) with me. This time he had asked me to bring one, so when I was there we smoked it in the yard.I find it very funny to see an old man, especially my grandpa, smoke a joint so I snapped a pic of it. Then my grandpa asked me to send it to my aunt, his daughter. This is where things went south...She immediatly texted back that she doesn't think it is funny and that is pathetic. I told her it's not a big deal and that's it legal where we live. That's when she began calling me stupid and she called me. I couldn't get a word in, the call was basically just her screaming and cussing at me and then hanging up.I told her I don't appreciate being yelled at, and that many problems can be solved by not making a problem out of it. I also explained that the only reason I send it to her is because grandpa asked me to.Then she told me ""how can you study at an university while you're so dumb"", and also, this is why I think she is quite insane, send me the nutrional facts for a piece of meat. Saying that I let my braincells die because I'm vegetarian and smoking weed. (for some reason she has a problem with me not eating meat?)I tried to be nice and hush the situation and then she called me a drug addict AGAIN and thats when I snapped and told her that maybe if she had a higher education aswell she might know what a drug addiction is. After this comment I immediatly apologized. The conversation ended with me telling her that we are entitled to our own opinions and lets quit arguing. And her last message to me was that I am to never contact her again because I am a drug addict and that she is much smarter than me and my mom. (idk why she suddenly began about my mom)My grandparents practically raised me and they are the best people I know. However their reaction to this is that we are both equally in the wrong, because I also said something mean. I feel like me saying ONE thing that could be conceived as mean ONLY after she called me every bad name in the book, yelling at me and belittling me, doesn't make me as rude as her.I feel very betrayed by both my grandparents and my aunt, and I thought my grandparents would be on my side. But after discussing further and having read the messages they still aren't. Was I really being an AH to my aunt?Fun fact: My aunt smokes a pack of sigaretes a dayTldr I send my aunt a pic of my grandpa smoking a joint, she went full mental on me (called me a drug addict among other things) and I said that if she had a higher education she might understand what a drug addiction is."
3,Everyone Sucks,AITA for getting mad at my wife for leaving our sleeping baby on the couch alone?,65,m1buuw,110,"My wife and I had our first baby 7 months ago, an amazing baby boy. Thankfully we got lucky with our jobs and both have been lucky enough to be working from home during the pandemic. When it comes to parenting we don't always see eye to eye but we both make compromises. Now my wife adores my son but something she did and said pissed me off.My wife works a couple of hours earlier than I do so I'm usually asleep while she takes care of him in the morning. I just so happened to get up earlier than normal this day and I made breakfast and we were having a pleasant morning. My wife had gotten him to sleep and since it would only be a short nap she put him down next to her on the couch. I went to my desk to start my work and I watched as she got up and went to go use the restroom.Now I was pretty annoyed that she would leave him unattended, sleeping or not, and sat next to him and waited for her to come back out. When she did I asked her to let me know next time she needed to go and I would get up to watch him. She told me that he would be fine and that she does it all the time when I'm asleep.   At this point I became pretty furious and I hate to admit it but I raised my voice and began to tell her how bad of an idea that was and she just fought with me on it dismissing my concerns which made me even more angry at that point.AITA for getting angry with her?EDIT: To add some context the couch is raised and we have hardwood floors. She watches him alone for a couple of hours in the morning and i do the same at night to allow her to sleep earlier. "
4,Everyone Sucks,AITA for calling over my wife to clean up our son's poop?,62,m1cds8,166,"Yesterday, my wife posted a set of videos on Facebook. The first one pans to me lying in bed on my phone, then shows our son eating Cheerios, with something on his hands. My wife asks him what the brown stuff is on his hands, and then after looking at his diaper, it looks like we've found the answer: it's poop. The second and third videos are of my wife washing our son and of the poop smeared on the inside of our second baby's empty bassinet, including on the sheets. The caption reads something like ""Husband called me over saying our son needed help, and this is what I came in to.""The first impression looks really bad, I admit. And apparently others thought so too because my father-in-law posts a comment asking why I was just lying in bed while our son smearing poop everywhere. Two of our mutual friends comment poking fun at each other saying that they're as neglectful to their son as I seem to be.Now here's where my part of the story comes in. What the videos leave out is the fact that I had been sleeping, cuddling with our newborn, and had just woken up to see that our older son had what I thought might be poop on his hands. My wife had left me alone to somehow watch the two of them while I was asleep. She recorded the video at just the right angle to cut out the newborn sleeping on my arm, so nobody watching the video could tell I wasn't just lying in bed on my phone out of sheer laziness.Our newborn is very fussy about not being held, and he was pinning down my arm, so I thought since my wife was available in the other room, I'd call her over to ask her to check on our son while I stayed cuddled with new baby to avoid waking him up.I don't believe there was anything wrong with me asking for some help here. The alternative would have been to leave the newborn by himself on the bed unattended, while I took 15 minutes to wash our older son in the bathtub, watch both our sons, and clean the furniture alone.My thinking is, if she's so outraged at having to wash our son and the furniture without also having to watch our newborn, how can she not understand that me doing all of that plus somehow watching our newborn warrants some degree of help? If she had been the one cuddling our newborn and had called me over, I would have just done it without any resentment, because I would've understood that it was more efficient for me to do so instead of her.Additionally, if she had asked me to switch places, I would've been fine with that.The post was up for hours with a lot of views and comments before I even saw it. She's since deleted the post so that nobody can see my comments anymore. And now some mutual friends have seen the post without also seeing my defense, and I've noticed that some have even started to avoid interacting with me.I really don't think that it was wrong of me to call her over, but I'm open to hearing what you all have to say. So Reddit, AITA?"
5,Everyone Sucks,AITA for telling my gf (28F) I (29M) don't like her bra,25,m1fory,98,"My GF of 10 years often points out things she doesn't like I do or buy. I don't like that but I'm okay with that. We are completely different people and we like different things. I would love to have similar taste for things, for example activities, clothing or cars (she hates mine and said that many times, but it's all good). She has a right for an opinion.Now, I think she's beautiful and stunning, but I don't really love the style of her clothing. I don't like a few things about how she dresses: we have different styles and I basically think that we should try to look nice for each other even if we stay at home, but again it's okay - that's her choice. I love her not because of what she wears.As we both know we like different things, we have decided that for Christmas we will gift each other huge packs of underwear we like for each other and we did. She liked some stuff I gifted, she returned some of it.Lately, she bought a new sports bra (she got it for a couple of dollars on AliExpress) and since it's pandemic and she's working from home she wears it all the time. I get that it might be really comfortable for her but I don't like the material, I don't like the color and I don't like how it looks on her. Basically anything would look better on her imho.So today, when we were driving together and talking about clothing, it somehow slipped off my tongue that I don't like that bra and I joked that I'm waiting for it to wear out so she starts to wear something else. She was completely devastated. She said that I have let her down, that I don't have empathy and she was instantly very hostile.I tried to tell her that it's nothing about her, I was talking about the bra and not her body or something (which she knows I completely adore and find her beautiful) but I felt that she was instantly passive aggressive and we had a pretty bad argument without understanding each other. I argued that it's the same thing she says about my car and we both have a right for opinion, but she told that it's completely different things, it's hurting her feelings, her insecurities and I just don't get women, I don't understand emotions and don't have empathy.I feel wrongly accused (and I feel that pretty often), but hey, I might be wrong here, right? So please, tell me - am I the asshole? Is it really such a delicate matter?"
6,Everyone Sucks,AITA for not apologizing to my dad and possibly sister?,552,m0x40y,48,"So today I (F23) was in a car accident. Completely the other party’s fault, he switched lanes into my lane completely slamming into the front half of my car. He had a faulty right side mirror and didn’t bother to look behind him and boom, the front piece of my car and headlight is torn off. Nobody was hurt, but I was pretty annoyed and shaken up.I called my dad (60M) to ask if he could pick me up, since I had to have my car towed. He says yes, he’ll be there shortly. He lives 20 minutes away from the accident site and is retired, so he didn’t have to call out of work or any other responsibilities. It took him an hour and a half to come get me, slower than the tow service, so I was a little bit annoyed. I would have just gotten an uber to work if I had known it was going to take this long.I thought, it’s ok, he’s doing me a favor, I shouldn’t complain so I didn’t. He then proceeds to lecture me in the car ride about the “importance of defensive driving so these things don’t happen,” and IMO kind of implies that I could have prevented this, which further gets under my skin because this was in no way my fault AT ALL and I really don’t think is appropriate to say to someone who’s just been in a very anxiety inducing accident. I got into work absolutely slammed with paperwork that I now had much less time to complete.Later that night I’ve been on the phone with insurance companies for hours, and am at this point having a day from hell. I ask my sister (18F) if for the rest of the week I can use the car she normally uses. This is my family’s car, not hers, and my parents are happy to drop her off/pick her up at school. The asking was mostly a formality because it’s not actually her car, and I already cleared it with my parents. Sister says she “needs some time to think about it” and this is where I might be the asshole. I kind of snapped at her and told her that me asking was just a formality and that I have a job I need to get to, and had cleared it with our parents. I also said I would be happy to pick her up or drop her off places, but I really did need the car. My dad yells at me that I need to be more polite about things. I yell back at him, saying that my job is important to me and me asking WAS me being polite to my sister. I don’t want to disrespect my sister or make her feel like her activities aren’t valuable or something, and I don’t want to come across as a brat. Was I totally out of line?Edit: Thanks everyone, I’ve apologized to my sister and talked to my dad and we’re all cool. Tensions were a little high after this accident just from the stress of the whole thing. I do love my dad and sister very much, and I am very grateful to have both of them in my life, so I’m glad y’all snapped me out of my anxiety induced grumpiness to apologize lol. I appreciate the input!"
7,Everyone Sucks,AITA for mentioning something my whole family never talks about?,1342,m0p3o5,148,"I (33F) was on a zoom call with my mother, my aunt and my aunt's daughter, who I will call Gina for this. I'm getting married later this year and they just wanted to have some wedding talk. Gina is a heart surgeon, very respected and very good at what she does. While I don't dislike her, I'd say she isn't a nice person. In fact I'd say she's a genuine psychopath from some of the things she's done in the past. As a teenager Gina was part of a gang of kids who were bullies and troublemakers. It got a lot more serious than that, to the point that Gina and a few of her friends were arrested and charged with a crime. I'm not going to say what it was, but it was serious enough that they had to be held in custody while awaiting trial and were refused bail. Long story short, my aunt and uncle had money, and pulled a lot of strings to make the charges against their daughter go away and get her released from custody. Ever since it's been an unspoken rule that her court case and being held in custody is something that nobody in the family ever brings up. Keep in mind that Gina's court case was well over 20 years ago now. To be fair to Gina, she took the opportunity she was given. She worked hard and has a great career, and I'm truly happy for her. Gina loves nice clothes and has a very large collection of gorgeous outfits as well as a collection of louboutins and other cool shoes. She was talking about what she might wear to the wedding, and made a joke that she ""hopes she doesn't outshine me too much"". I was offended at what she said. It's not out of the ordinary for her to say a cruel comment like that but I didn't like the fact that she actually wanted to spoil my day. In response I asked Gina if she kept her prison uniform and said she'd get all the attention if she wore that. Gina didn't seem to care but my aunt was absolutely raging, saying I'd crossed a line by mentioning ""that"". She left the call and Gina left soon after. My mother gave me a long lecture, saying that I should have known that was a sensitive topic for them. I'm sorry but I wasn't the one making jokes about ruining someone's wedding with their nice clothes. She made a cruel joke so I made one back. What's wrong with that?"
8,Everyone Sucks,AITA for not washing a cutting board that my brother used,9,m1gtnl,18,"My brother and I just had an argument over a cutting board, and I genuinely think I was right. I used the cutting board to make an avocado salad and didn't wash it after wards because I assumed the next person to use it, would also need it to cut the same things. And I was right since he used it to cut some tomatoes, onions and peppers. However after doing so, he told me ""I'm done with the cutting board, clean it"" and I said ""well if you found it in a clean enough state to use, wouldn't that mean you should clean it"" and we began arguing. This argument isn't serious but am I right?"
9,Everyone Sucks,AITA for being the middle man for my wife and our roommates argument and telling my wife to let it go and move on?,20,m19jtk,91,"My wife with her emotional support dog, 2 year old daughter and I moved into a house with a Family my wife grew up with, they travel for work  and can be gone for 10 months of the year. My wife can be stubborn at times and when they get into an argument my wife tends to stay angry longer than she should so I step in to try to help calm both sides down. I try to see both sides and act accordingly and try to be unbiased to my wife.A argument happened while I was at work and the roommates were home. My wife's dad just had neck surgery and is on medication that gives him anxiety and so my wife goes over to help him since she has dealt with anxiety most of her life. She has to keep her dog at home because he has a bigger dog that tries to attack it and when put away he continuously tries to get out and won't stop barking so my wife leaves her dog at home. My wife didn't ask if our roommates could watch her dog and the dog is still being potty trained to go out side. They messaged my wife saying they were leaving for a bit and wanted to know where her cage was (We are trying to crate train her dog but decided to wait for the roommates to leave since she barks a lot while in there and they keep yelling at her to stop) my wife replied saying please don't put her in due to not being use to it yet and she tends to eat her own poop and to just put her in our room. Shortly after my wife gets home and finds that they put the dog in the cage any ways and left. She got upset and told them that they disrespected her wishes. Their argument was she didn't ask and they didn't want her dog to poop and pee in the house. My wife then put the dog in our room and locks the door to our daughter's door. While at work I get a call from the roommates saying my wife had no right to lock our daughter's room and our room and threaten to take our doors off.I don't agree 100% with them but after talking to them I can get their side minus the removing our doors part. I also don't 100% agree with my wife only for the fact she keeps bringing things up from past arguments and tries to throw it in their face. Our roommates have helped us out financially a few times but they also see my wife like a daughter to them since she grew up with them and tries to tell her how to raise our daughter and train her dog and get annoyed that we don't always follow their advice they give.I have told my wife to just ignore the small things and them putting the dog in the cage was one time and if they did it multiple times then be angry about it. They talk to me and are ok and got some toys for my daughter but since my wife hasn't talked to them since that day the make some remakes like saying when is she going to grow up.  AITA for telling my wife to let it go and move on?Edit: I want to thank everyone for the different views on the situation and the feedback a lot gave. I want to also add a few things.1. The dog was prescribed by my wife's therapist and we got a puppy, she is 4 months old, so we could give it training for her anxiety.2. The roommates got a puppy from the same place we did and is the same age as ours, only a few months old and is still getting potty trained as well.3. Some people asked why don't we move out, we actually moved in mid january and I just got a new job so we are trying to save up what we can to find a new place. As far as lease goes, we are in a month to month with our landlordAgain thank you all for the feed back and I see now some of you are right, I do need to stand for my wife more. I also want to say I don't 100% agree with both sides considering this argument happened over them putting the dog in her crate. To me it was something small that both sides grew into something big. I am going to talk to my wife more about it and try to talk to them to hopefully come to reason. We are going to save as much as we can to hopefully find a new place to go since things don't look to be working out here."
10,Everyone Sucks,AITA for getting upset with my best friend because he ignores me and flakes on me when he's with her gf?,3,m1g2iq,20,"Throwaway account, anyway let's get straight to the point.My male best friend is in a long term relationship of 6 years. Now, bear in mind, this is one of those very unbalanced relationships where they do love each other a lot but he loves her WAY MORE than she does. She's at the very first place in his life and he would do anything for her. To give you an idea, he'd instantly leave anything he's doing in order to satisfy her needs of the moment. He multiple times flaked on work trips because she admittedly ""wanted company"" before her uni deadline.Now, you can wonder how frequently I get flaked or ignored with the most bland excuses which I obviously know are meant to hide the fact that she probably just doesn't want to hang out (she's the laziest person I've met in my life and also very cheap). This also extends to texts and calls: if he's with her then he's off limits basically, at her majesty's service, not able to answer a simple text or a call. Viceversa, if I'm with him and she calls then run for your lives! He can even stay at the phone for half an hour while we're taking a walk just because she wanted to chat.AITA for getting upset by this behavior?They recently both helped me a lot during an emotionally hard time of my life and are both in general great friends to me and for this reason I tend to justify this behavior, feeling I shouldn't get upset just because they were there when I needed them."
11,Everyone Sucks,AITA for insulting my SIL after years of holding my tongue?,3555,m0b436,1067,"My SIL is low class. I really have no better way of putting it. She has a 10th grade education, thinks she is smarter than everyone else, and brags to make herself seem like more than she is. At her core, she's white trash, plain and simple. My brother is the only reason she's not living in a trailer right now.  She will bluntly talk about her sex life, about things she's done, and shit that nobody really wants to hear. She'll also openly insult me and I'm told by my parents to just accept it and not make waves with my brother. For eight years, I've tolerated her on the basis that she makes my brother happy.  This weekend, we were all together and she began talking about how my brother is a blanket hog. My fiance laughed and admitted that she was the blanket hog when we shared a bed and I never woke her up to get them back.  SIL responded that she would wake my brother out of a sound sleep to get the blankets back, and that once he was awake he'd be looking for something else. She then stated that I knew better than to wake my fiance up, because I obviously didn't have my A game at that time. These feral comments are typical of the type of thing she typically says.  I replied, ""I can make due with the sheet and light blanket. I don't need to disturb her sleep when she gets up so early."" She laughed, ""I'm just saying, don't wake us up if you don't have the game to back it up!""  My fiance was a virgin when we got together. This is not well known as it's really nobody's business but hers. At this point, I'd had a few drinks, and I was feeling a bit prickish.  I smiled and replied, ""I can confidently say I am the best that my fiance has ever had in her life.""  SIL rolled her eyes, looked at my fiance and asked, ""Really? I mean, I know you have you stroke his ego, but really?""  My fiance laughed, ""Well, actually he's right. He is definitely the best I've ever had, and that's not an exaggeration.""  SIL shook her head, ""In your whole life? Be honest. Woman to woman, who's the best?""  My fiance admitted, ""He's my first, best, and only.""  SIL laughed, ""Wow! Seriously? You gotta put some miles on those tires before deciding on the best.""  I interjected, ""Well, when you buy a new model right off the floor as opposed to a used up beater, you don't have to worry about who's been inside of it before you.""  Note: I do not think of women like this. I love and value my fiance no matter what, and I drunkenly attempted to flip her own metaphor back on my SIL.  SIL became very quiet and they left shortly after. My brother told me that my SIL is very upset with me and says I called her a whore. I told him that I'd been holding my tongue for a decade for his benefit and I was done putting up with her.  I regret saying it, mainly because of the sexist implication and being drunk, but I stand by shutting down that line of conversation. AITA?"
12,Everyone Sucks,AITA: For Not Giving My Friend Answers?,5,m1bu2l,8,"For context: I'm one of the top 3 in my class So, this story is fairly recent. I go to a private school, and we have midterms, and on midterms especially online exams, I and a couple other friends usually work together.  Then, comes friend A, he isn't in my group, and we didn't make any promises before, and he usually doesn't help me either. Social exams came up, and I really can't concentrate, because besides my group trying to get answers, and my other friend trying to get my answer (we made a pact), I forgot to give friend A my answers. So, I told him, just to do it by himself.   It occured to me that I finished 2 minutes before the deadline, and so did my group and my other friend, but I forgot about friend A, and didn't give him answers, so he ran out of time. I don't know for sure if he managed to do it on time or not, but based on our chat, I assume he didn't.AITA for not giving him the answers?"
13,Everyone Sucks,AITA for getting a room every beach house visit because of having kids?,860,m0fbk8,355,"First, using a throwaway, also non native English speaker so I apologize in advance for any mistakes. On mobile. So this is a conflict going back about 8 years that just flared up again. My parents (f65) and (m68) have a beach house with 3 bedrooms. The smallest is theirs and have only a double bed, the other two rooms are a bit bigger and they each have one double bed and a bunk bed, so sleeping room for 4 people. When me (f29) and my siblings Adam (m32), Eric (m27) and Sara (f25) were kids we would have one room for me and my sister and one for my brothers. When we got older and got partners we started a rotation system so that two couples would share a room while one couple got a room for themselves and the last couple would sleep on the pullout sofa in the livingroom. Its important to note that this is what we all wanted as then we would all get one stay in every 3 to have some privacy.This system worked great until 8 years ago when Adam and his wife got a baby boy, and whenever we stayed at the beach house they would get a room for themself, for obvious reasons. So then the remaining couples would rotate between the last room and the livingroom and no one got a room all alone. Then I got pregnant with twins, they're now 6, and so me and my husband and the twins would use the other room and the two last couples would sleep in the livingroom, one on the couch and the other on campingbeds. Since then Adam and his wife has gotten another boy, now 4, and I have a 3 year old girl. Obviously this didn't make Eric and Sara too happy, but Eric and his girlfriend was understanding, Sara was not. She was pretty upset and would argue about this every time, and we all understood she was upset so we tried suggesting things like not all of us going at the same time but she didn't want that, she wanted everyone there like we have always done, we tried suggesting renting a camper or somthing like that but again she refused. She only wanted a private room every 3 trips. Which again is understandable but babies need more sleep than adults and having them sleep in the livingroom would mean it would have to be quiet there from like 7 and that wasn't an option either. Anyway, when my youngest turned 2 we, that would be me, husband, Adam and his wife, started having all the kids in one room and rotating one of the four of us sleeping there too. The rest would sleep in the livingroom and let Eric and his girlfriend and Sara and her boyfriend have the other room every other visit. That worked great up until now, when Eric just announced that they are expecting a baby in september and Sara lost it. She screamed and cursed and accused us all activly keeping her from ever getting a fair share of the rooms and it was so unfair of us to be getting rooms just because we have kids. This went on for days and shes still pissed and the rest of us are really starting to feel awful. Are we the assholes here?Edit: I realise I need to clarify some things. 1) Like I said the last year things have been going great because my sister has been getting a room. The problem arises again noe because my other brother is having a baby, and this summer he and his girlfriend got into the whole sleeping in a hammock outside thing, and obviously can't do that with a baby. 2) the situation with all of us up there only happens in the summer, usually for one week and one weekend a month or so later. This is where things went well last summer because my sister got a room and my brother slept in his hammock. 3) the rest of the year they usually invite us two siblings at a time, so each family gets a room. Usually 6 weekends a year. The problem here is that my sister shows up on the weekends me and my brother are invited, because she doesn't want to be left out as she says. 4) my parents won't sell the house as its annold familyhouse. Me and my husband is looking for houses nearby to buy but its going slow, seeing as theres not a lot of houses around. Its a bit remote. 5) the nearest hotel is 35 minutes away. Again, kinda remote place. Thats why we don't stay there. Hence the camper suggestion."
14,Everyone Sucks,AITA for staying out of my friends' drama?,4,m1c28e,7,"Sorry this is long, but I've always felt a little guilty about this and I wanted to get reddit's opinion.Back in grad school, two of my friends were F and J, both late 20's/F. F and J were really close, they had kind of a big-sister (J) little-sister (F) relationship, I even think that J took F on a trip abroad with her family. J was super smart, really pretty and sweet but kinda nerdy, would crack jokes that only she would laugh at, that kind of thing. F's a spitfire, tiny and cute and got away with a lot.A few years before this situation happened, F started dating R. He was like the human equivalent of a golden retriever, funny, kind of a jock, head over heels for F. She loved him but was could be super insecure, which is weird because R was so crazy about her. This becomes relevant later.About halfway through the year, J called me and F and asked us to come over. She told us that she was leaving the program, which we were totally caught off guard by. J didn't go into details but I think it was something mental health related, maybe depression. She had a few months to wrap up things at school and then she was out. F was really upset at first, but then I started noticing that her attitude toward J seemed to be changing. She kept talking about how she was shocked that J was leaving, maybe she didn't know J at all, etc. F also started saying that J was acting flirtatiously towards R I was  confused because J was pretty affectionate and huggy but I had never seen her be inappropriate, but F told me that J had once been ""the other woman"" in a relationship and so she couldn't trust her. F refused to talk to J about this because she didn't want to mess up her last few months at the program, and J seemed totally oblivious to her feelings. It was really awkward for me because I liked them both but was a lot closer to F, and I felt like I couldn't say anything. R thought F  was crazy but also didn't talk to J about it. So finally J moved back home, and a few days later F confronted her on the phone. They ended up having a really big argument and their friendship pretty much exploded. Here's where I think I might be the AH: J reached out to me a few days after their argument wanting to know why M thought this about her, basically begging me to explain it to her. I honestly didn't know what to say so I just didn't answer. About a week after that, J reached out again with another long text just basically saying that she hoped I'd talk to her. At this point, I really just wanted to stay out of the whole M/J drama so I didn't respond. I liked J a lot but I had to still be at the program with F for another few years, and I didn't see how I could really help J anyways. So, reddit, AITA? It wasn't my proudest moment but I think it was understandable given my friendship with F."
15,Everyone Sucks,AITA for asking for my money back?,4,m16dbb,58,"First of all, English is my second language, so sorry for misspellings or mistakes. Also I'm on my phone. The story is this: two years ago me (F23) and my best friend (F22) rented an apartment, she was supposed to pay rent and I'd pay the bills, and then we'd give eachother the correspondent money. On the apartment also lived her boyfriend (M24) and a friend of theirs (F26). Her boyfriend at the beginning lived with us because that way we could split everything in 4 and pay less, we didn't plan this at the beginning, but it was his decision. He didn't have a permanent job so he had money coming but not as much as my friend and me. Their friend said she would be putting less money because she didn't have a permanent job either, and she was giving what she could to my best friend to pay rent. No problem here in theory. The issue is that on the first few months the boyfriend offered to carry the counting of the numbers of the house (rent and bills) , but he never did. He also never paid me anything, and neither did the others. At one point he said we didn't want to live with us anymore, so we excluded him and divided everything between 3. But he was still living with us everyday, eating, showering, sleeping, “because he was my best friend's boyfriend.“I paid my part of the rent every month and I carried all the bills, so I was living paycheck to paycheck, I never could save some money or sometimes even buy food. This carried on until I decided to move again with my parents.When I started demanding my money back the boyfriend owed me like 300€, but the others owed me around 600€ each. The boyfriend said that he owed me nothing because he was living with us ""as a favour"", and my friend said I owed her money because she counted some amount that I owed her long before living together (300€), plus an amount that she was overpaying of the first few months of rent because her boyfriend did the numbers wrong, so I owed her my part. At the end, both girls owed me around 1000€ each and the boyfriend 300€ with the ""discount"".Now, I think she shouldn't have mixed the money I owed her before living together. I was only asking for the billing money, and we both did things for eachother for years. Without the money I owed, the numbers said that she owed me, but she doesn't want to hear it. The boyfriend should pay me what he owes from the months he was officially living with us at least, I was not even asking him to pay for the two whole years, but he decided to pay me nothing ""because it was a favour""And their friend blocked me everywhere when I asked for her part. No excuses. I even told her that she could give me like 20€ a month so it wasn't so hard for her to give it back. No response. So I am around 2300€ poorer and they treat me as a traitor for leaving them to pay for everything and leaving the house with a two week warning. AITA for asking for my money back?"
16,Everyone Sucks,AITA for Telling my Fiancé that His Best Friend Invited a “FWB” to a Party This Weekend?,38,m0ux10,19,"My (24f) fiancé Joe (24m) has been friends with “Ben” (25m) since they were in elementary school. Ben recently got out of a shitty relationship, and ended up replying to a Snapchat I had of a “girls night out” picture of my friend, Jess (23f), on my Snapchat story. He asked me for her Snapchat, so after checking with my fiancé to see if he’d be okay with me getting two of our friends together, and asking if she was good with it, I sent him her snap. This was about two months ago now, I guess they’ve been talking a lot and some pictures were exchanged, so it’s kinda a FWB situation. Joe and I, along with a couple of our good friends, decided to have a little outdoor party (12 people) now that the weather is nice and the majority of our friend group is vaccinated (most of us are doctoral students and work in healthcare). We decide to have it at Joe’s house that he rents with his friends Mike and Kevin, since they have a big yard and some guest rooms.  My fiancé hasn’t seen Ben in a while, and invited him to come, and the other guys were fine with him staying on a couch (other guest rooms were claimed, since we don’t want people to drive after drinking). Jess is  roommates with another friend of mine who isn’t on good terms with my fiancé right now, but they’re usually a “package deal”, and since I didn’t want to deal with any drama I just didn’t tell her about the party. Fast forward to today. I was meeting with Jess and some other friends to study and she mentions to me that Ben invited her to “a party that my fiancé and I were having this weekend”, and he had invited her to spend the night for the party. She also mentioned this in front of the friend who I was trying not to invite because I didn’t want to have to do damage control. It ended up being kinda messy, and my other friend isn’t talking to me or Jess now.So I texted my fiancé and told him what was going on, and asked if he knew Ben has invited one of my friends. Apparently Ben hadn’t asked, and my fiancé was pissed. Not only because his friend hadn’t asked permission to invite someone to the party, but he had put me in a really awkward situation I had been trying to avoid with my friends (not that he knew, but still), and was presumably going to try to get laid on my fiancé’s couch. Ben ended up texting me and was really upset that I hadn’t just reached out to him to ask about it, since my fiancé is has apparently told him to not come to the party this weekend. So AITA for telling my fiancé that his friend invited his FWB to a party without asking?"
17,Everyone Sucks,AITA for being ungrateful on my birthday?,13,m0ywlv,37,"preface: I live abroad and have only one friend that I see other than my boyfriend whom I live with. I do not physically socialize with anybody else at all. I see her every day at the gym, but we’ve only known each other a few months. Our friendship got very intense very quickly. It was my (28f) birthday this past Friday. My boyfriend dropped the idea of spending the weekend at a city we live an hour from. We found a dog boarder and I was excited to go away with him & chill without thinking of school, work, the dogs etc. He booked this fancy hotel, which shocked me cause we’re usually cheap as shit but I was impressed he’d booked such a place. I assumed the plan was just to go there, explore the city, grab dinner & drinks and chill then head home the next day. When my family asked my birthday plans, that is what I told them. Basically expressing it as a romantic weekend getaway. I’ve been extraordinarily stressed lately, what with covid, being 4000 miles from my family, upcoming exams and visa stress, I was looking forward to the time away. On Friday my boyfriend “ruined the surprise” by telling me my friend had planned to surprise me by coming along too. This had me pissed and upset. He then said she’d planned to buy me other surprise gifts too. I think I might be the asshole because I burst into tears and completely locked my friend out. I hadn’t even spoken to her but she suddenly texted me saying she knew the surprise was ruined and did I think she’d be a third wheel if she came. I was completely thrown because it was literally seconds after my boyfriend had told me and I guess he’d text her straight away. Before I had a chance to process my change of plans she was asking me to choose between the plans I didnt even know where happening and what I thought was happening. I just shut down completely. The day we were due to go away, she came and dropped off her “surprise gifts” (bearing in mind she’d already given me a gift in the week): 4 dresses, a full spa kit, a PhotoFrame, a shit ton of drinks, and 3(!) extra birthday cards and A homemade cake I’d asked my boyfriend to make AND a bouquet of flowers was delivered on my bday too. I was very unresponsive opening the gifts and felt guilty that I didn’t show more of a reaction but I was so upset and overwhelmed that I didn’t know what to think. Eventually I told my boyfriend to cancel the hotel, where I found he’d booked 2x $350 rooms (one for our friend and one for us) which I was angry at because it’s too much money. I ended up spending my birthday weekend in tears and angry at myself and everyone and have basically ignored my friend who spent way too much money on me. AITA for being ungrateful for her gifts and effort when I ruined the surprise they’d planned?"

19,Everyone Sucks,AITA for getting mad at my sister because she ignored my texts for over a week?,12,m0ss8o,25,"My (15F) sister (17F) doesn’t live with me and I don’t get to see her often except for holidays. We keep in touch often via texting and phone calls, and we have a good relationship. Recently she stopped texting me as often, and I’m aware she’s someone who really needs a lot of ‘me’ time so I’ve always tried to give her some space. (I like to think I’m not a clingy person? But I really need to constantly just have someone to chat with) A couple weeks ago she somehow let it slip in conversation that she “tolerates me” when I talk to her. I was stunned and she followed that up with an explanation that I’m too energetic for her sometimes and I suck up her patience like an “energy vampire.” I was kinda hurt by what she said, but she apologized profusely and said she didn’t mean it like that, so I didn’t think much of it. A few days after that conversation took place, I shot her a random text about something, and she didn’t respond to it for 3 days. I just assumed it was another one of those days where she needed some alone time, but 3 days turned into 6 days and she’s never ignored me for that long before. I started getting worried and I shot her texts asking if she okay. She never responded and that’s when I seriously started to think something was wrong. When 6 days turned into 12 days, I even called our grandmother to ask if she’s heard from my sister in the last week, and she said no. I texted a gc that my sister and our mutual friends are in to see if any of them had heard from her, and they said no. After about 10 minutes of texting in the gc, my sister popped in and said “I could’ve gone longer than that if y’all didn’t bother me.” Here’s where I may be TA. I told her that she’s fucking insane for not giving a quick reply to me when it’s clear from my multiple texts to her over the last 12 days that I’m worried about her. She said I’m overreacting and that I’m “clingy like a fucking leech.” She told me I’m making this way too big of a deal when it doesn’t need to be, and honestly I think I may have overreacted too, but I was just rly pissed off at the time.

I (25f) have been dating T (25m) for almost three years, we live together have a dog plan to get married all that. T had a sister named G (22 f) who I was kind of close with. G broke up with her ex a month or so ago. She admitted to cheating with her now bf (21 m). It should be noted that G has a better relationship with me than she does T. Lots of stuff growing up thats too long to post here. G has also caused quite a few issues in the past. We are still friends with ex because he was our friend. We don't talk about G or her new bf or anything with ex. G does not like that we are still friends and we have explained to her why and told her that frankly she's just going to have to deal with it because while we don't agree with what she did she's still family. Fast forward to yesterday. We have met new bf and he is ok, he's younger than us and we don't have much in common but no official opinion. T and G's parents invited us on a vacation in August. G told me yesterday while we were having out that new bf was invited. I was like ok cool whatever. Here is where I may be the AH, I was texting T while I was out with her and told him that new bf was invited. I just said ""hey new bf is coming"" and that was it.  He flipped out. He called his parents in a rage. I knew new bf wasn't his favorite but I had absolutly no idea that he was going to react like that. The short of it is that his parents flipped and then his mom started accusing me of being phony and saying nasty things about me all to him, never once coming to me and asking me about any of it. His sister then this am sends texts once again attacking me and saying she's done with T and I. I sent a message back saying that I'm sorry, it was not my intention at all and I'm not trying to be two faced and thay I didn't know T was going to react like that.  She knew that I didn't have an opinion on new bf because I just don't know him well enough yet.

We decided it would be fun to host a dinner party with some of our friends. For some context, Matt is Indian and most of the friends we invited were his friends and also Indian (this will be important later). I had planned on doing most of the cooking for this party, which I didn't really mind because I got to call my mom to go over recipes and stuff. So, fast forward to the Sunday of the party. I was cooking all my family's Jewish af recipes (brisket, matzo ball soup, etc...) Matt came into the kitchen when I was almost done, and he said something to the effect of, ""well, if we get married, you'll have to start cooking my cultural food and not just yours."" I took offense to this because I feel like I should be able to cook whatever the fuck I want to cook when I'm the one cooking. If he wanted biryani or something, he could've cooked it himself, right? I have, in the past, cooked traditional Indian food (it didn't really turn out, but it's the thought that counts). I feel as though I overreacted a little because I took the pan I was holding (the soup) and just threw it away. He didn't take that well. AITA?"

He was very sad and seemed on the verge of tears. Annoying girl then interjected with her story about her dog being missing when she was seven!? Then she started crying. It was so forced everyone in the vicinity looked over and cringed.After she finally forced a tear down her cheek she dramatically wiped off her singular tear. Since we all know she loved pulling this BS all the time we just continued talking.She interjected a final time when she coincidentally had a pet go missing today... which was confusing since why would she not tell us that story first?My friends and I just kinda looked at her and I told her to ""stop making everything about yourself, and this very clearly didn't happen"".She actually started crying when we called her out and she ran into the bathroom. Since one of my friends has her mom's phone number he called her later that day to inquire about the missing pet.Lo and behold she didn't know what her annoying ass daughter was talking about. We're not gonna cut her off just yet because we kinda found it amusing but she texted me later that day calling me TA.She said: ""I was just trying to make him feel as if he wasn't alone and had someone to lean on, YOU shouldn't have made everything about yourself.""

I don't have pets, I argued with him but he just goes. It was 20:00 at this point I had no idea she was pregnant so I said I'd look after her for a day. The dog was relatively friendly and my housemate was out of town until Thursday so I figured I could just deal for 1 nite. Dog gave birth to nine puppies over the next night. Completely shocked. it was horrendous I woke up to an extremely upset dog, screaming puppies, blood all over the place from the birth. I called a bunch of places but they all said they wouldn't take a dog in active labour.I did my best with the puppies after googling what kind of nest (?) I should build. puppies are so useless they can't even regulate their own body temourature. I had to spend nearly 100 dollars on lamps, blankets, rugs, etc. plus time I spent cleaning and disinfecting from the fucking crime scene that the birth caused.I am NOT a dog person. There is dog shit everywhere and my house smells like TEN FUCKING DOGS ALL THE TIME and the puppies **constantly** scream. They do not stop screaming.

We recently decided to Airbnb a vacation house together and one of my friends (Brandon) did the legwork to find and pay for the house upfront. The house chosen had 5 bedrooms, one for each couple and one for me as a sole occupant. The total bill would be $2000 for the entire trip. Brandon ended up saying I owed $400 for my portion. ($2000/5 rooms). I was taken aback, thinking that it should be per person and that my portion should be around $222 ($2000/9 people). His argument was it was a per room price, like a hotel. I countered stating we didn’t rent just rooms,  we rented an entire house that everyone occupied, used, and enjoyed. Why should I have to pay nearly double of everyone else just because I am single? I said I wouldn’t be going and Brandon was pissed, because he lost the deposit due to cancellation. AITA for backing out, not wanting to pay double what everyone else paid?"
25,Everyone Sucks,AITA for yelling at my sister?,23,m07t9t,31,"(17F) I suffer from severe schizophrenia and OCD. Mostly my family is respectful of this except for my little sister, (15F), who is a nightmare to live with.I love my little sister but she never respects me or my disability, and I don't ask a lot of her.I'm VERY food oriented. I plan out my meals days in advance. I also am incredibly routine oriented and can only sit in certain seats at the table for dinner or in the car.I had planned to have a muffin this morning and I had one the previous morning (4 in a carton) and got up and we were completely out. I was incredibly upset by this which seems very ridiculous and I can understand why people would laugh at that but for me it's very upsetting to have my routine or plans thrown off even slightly and I asked my sister politely if she ate it.She ate 2 of the muffins and me and my brother each had one. We ended up arguing. I was willing to let it go but this happens frequent enough to be an issue and I tried to be as polite as possible about it but she kept resorting to name-calling. I brought up other facts including thatA. When my cousin lied about me and said incredibly horrible things about me, my sister tried to make plans to hang out with her the next day.B. I always knock and ask if I can enter her room. She does not do this for me and will not leave when asked, even when on call with friends. C. If I'm doing work, she'll find a reason to use the master bathroom. Even though we have 2 other bathrooms she will complain whenever I ask her to leave.My parents have this sort of idea that since we're practically adults we can sort things out ourselves but will also take sides in arguments they weren't a part of or mediate things. She steals from me and blames it on my schizophrenia for not remembering lending her $50 in paints that she proceeded to lose and not return or pay for, when I know I wouldn't have let her use them? That's my problem. She's not respectful of my room and privacy and will WAKE ME UP IN THE MORNINGS if she wants something from me despite the fact I'm supposed to be left alone when sleeping because I'm a hypersomniac? That's my problem.My parents have the ""grow a thicker skin"" mentality and are quick to point out her severe anxiety when giving her a reason to do things but blaming my meltdowns or issues on schizophrenia/autism isn't allowed. I couldn't take it any more today and I snapped and I yelled at them both. I just wanted a muffin. I broke down in tears and my sister laughed at me and I was sent to my room shortly after her asked my mother what her plans are to make sure this doesn't happen again and she laughed at me.I feel like maybe I went too far. Maybe I should have just let it go.I haven't eaten today and I don't think I can. When my routine gets messed up like this I can't eat for a day or so or I'll vomit. I'm incredibly depressed and I don't know what to do.  Am I as ridiculous as I feel I sound?"
