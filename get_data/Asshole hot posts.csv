0,Asshole,AITA for not wanting to discuss my deceased sister?,3852,m1ejs3,826,"Before I (19F) was born, my parents had another kid, Hannah. When Hannah was 8, she died due to an accident. I was born 2 years later.Growing up, she was constantly mentioned. We went to her grave multiple times a year, pictures were hung in our house, stories were told. I wouldn’t say it overshone me in anyway, I still got to be my own person, my parents never wanted me to be Hannah and they celebrated my accomplishments. But still, she was always talked about and I was always told I had a sister, asked how I felt about her...and it took me years to admit to myself that I feel nothing for her. I never met her and due to her death, she’s always been made into this saint like figure, it’s like she’s this person I’ve watched documentaries about. I have respect for her...but I don’t consider her my sister. If others ask if I have siblings, I say no. Now that I’m living on my own, I don’t visit Hannah. I don’t display the pictures of her that my parents gave to me over the years. I’ve told a few close friends and my ex as I felt they had a right to know, but outside that...there’s nothing to discuss.Recently, my mom was talking about Hannah, a lot. I’ve told her before I don’t want to talk about Hannah anymore, but she doesn’t listen. The other day, she kept going on about a story I’ve heard a million times and I said “I thought I told you I was done talking about her.” My mom replied “She’s your sister” and I said “technically, maybe.” My mom got really offended and I pointed out we weren’t raised together. I don’t know her. I feel nothing for her. My mom started crying and called me heartless. She said that I don’t have to discuss Hannah, but she’s not going to stop just because I want to pretend she never existed.My dad has said what I said about Hannah is near unforgivable and I need to re-evaluate my priorities. AITA?"
1,Asshole,AITA for letting my FIL write me into his will over his two daughters?,1277,m198t7,412,"I (35m) and my wife(32f) have been married for 7 years and we have 2 kids now. My FIL is an older man who is somewhat stuck in his older more male centric world view. Because of this, he has always treated me like the ""son he never had"" going so far to call me his son in front of his friends and stuff. He invites me on trips with him to go hunting, boating, and all sorts of other things. He also helped me get my current job. This has caused a lot of problems with my wife and she calls FIL a misogynist and all sorts of things. While I agree with her that it is awkward, I try not to blame old people for being stuck in the past so much.Well the other day I was helping FIL with something and he brought up the fact that he was probably not going to live longer especially with Covid19 and stuff (not sure why because he is already vaccinated). Well he basically told me he always wanted a man he could trust to leave his money to and take care of the family and that I would be it. He showed me a copy of his will and while most heirlooms and other things were left to his daughters, the lion share of his money was left to me with instructions to ""take care of his daughters"". He asked me if I would honor the terms and I said that of course I would and didn't really think much of it because me and my wife share finances anyways. I don't really keep things from my wife so I went home and told her about it and she completely freaked out on me. She said I was feeding into his bullshit and that I should have declined being placed into his will. She called her sister and now they are both freaking out about it. I have no idea what he would have done if I said don't give it to me but I know that I don't plan to try to steal their money. I mean my wife will own what I own anyways. I'm not really sure what to do because my wife and I never fight, but I really wish this could blow over.AITA for letting my FIL leave his inheritance to me instead of his two daughters?Just a couple of things because it keeps coming up in comments:-My wife is much better at finances than me and she even makes more money than me. I never grew up in a stable household and didn't really learn how to manage money, but I have learned a lot from her family. I married into an upperclass family and they have always treated me great and never brought it up, but I still try to fit in and not make waves. That's why I said I'm not trying to be confrontational about the misogyny thing because they always get on their dad for it anyways."
2,Asshole,AITA for not defending my girlfriend’s son when my kids accused him of being a liar even though I suspected he was telling the truth?,952,m18ogp,327,"I’ve been with my GF for 2.5 years and we moved in together about 2 months ago. Her son Elias (5) lives with us the majority of the time, but he goes to see his dad during the school holidays and sometimes more depending on what the ex wants. I had never met her ex until a week ago. My kids (Matthew, 10 & Sophia, 7) & divide their time 50/50 between my house and my ex’s.My GF’s ex is a textbook Disney dad. I don’t say anything because it’s not my place but when I first found out about the things Elias did when he was with his dad, I was concerned it would cause jealously among the kids. For the most part, things have been fine since Elias doesn’t really brag and he only usually brings up his dad to my GF.Elias went through a phase where he was obsessed with fish/sea life. My GF’s ex got him a huge fish tank when he found out, which is cool of him. Then in August, he took Elias on a two-week trip, again that was cool of him.A week or so after Elias got back from the trip, I’m watching all of the kids while my GF runs some errands. Elias won’t stop talking about how he swam with the fish. Matthew tells him he’s lying and the kids get into an argument. It ends with Elias crying but I was able to calm him down before my GF got back and I told Matthew to apologise.Matthew and Sophia started purposely excluding him and claimed that their mother told them they shouldn’t be friends with liars. My GF gets upset but puts it down to them going through a phase since she’s never heard them call Elias a liar. I have a word with my ex and the kids, and things go back to normal.Fast forward to two weeks ago and my ex shows up at our house to have a word with my GF about Elias’ continuous lies. Apparently, he’s been telling the kids about all of the other stuff he’s been doing with his dad since the fish incident and both kids are upset because they think he is still making stuff up to make them jealous. After my ex leaves, my GF is fuming at ME. She asks me what happened and gets angry at me for not defending Elias when I knew it was likely true. Then she broke up with me and said she was moving out because she wasn’t going to be that parent who put a man before her child.I would have apologised but then she shows up a week ago with a few people to help her move out, including her ex. He’s a complete AH to me and my GF just ignores me the whole time.I’m thinking about apologising still because I want to fix our relationship, but I want to know if I’m the AH or not first.AITA?"
3,Asshole,AITA for burying my neighbors dog without telling them?,147,m1hhfu,104,"My (34m) neighbors (30s M/F) went through a difficult time recently for reasons that it's not my place to go into. To recover, they went abroad. They left their dog at home and arranged to pay someone to come feed and walk the dog.They had been gone for about 2 weeks when I found their dog under a hedge between our yards. It was very clearly deceased. I don't know what happened to it - there was no obvious trauma. Lest you ask, no, I did not harm the dog in any way. I was at a bit of a loss, because I (a) didn't have the dog walker's contact information and (b) I did not know when my neighbors would be returning.I debated trying to contact my neighbors. On the one hand, they probably would want to know and to come home. On the other hand, bad news keeps, and they were *already* on vacation trying to cope with the aftermath of a difficult experience. I thought about what I would want if I were in their shoes, and I decided that what I'd want is for someone to bury my pet in my yard and tell me when I returned. Initially, I'd be upset just because I was surprised but in a couple days I would get over the surprise, see the sense in it, and be grateful.So that's what I did - I buried the dog in a nice corner of their backyard. I wrote a note asking them to give me a call on their return and slid it under their door. I also stuck a note labeled ""dogwalker"" on the door with tape which asked the dog walker to give me a call. The dog walker did give me a call a couple days later, and I explained what had happened and what I had done. I said that I had not contacted my neighbors, and the dogwalker could make their own choice about whether to inform them of the dog's passing.My neighbors came back a couple weeks later. They were surprised and are very, very unhappy. The dogwalker did not contact them to tell them what had happened, and of course, neither did I. They don't blame me for the dog's death, but they do feel very strongly that I should have contacted them immediately. I expected them to feel that way initially, but it has been a few days and there is no sign yet of those feelings diminishing in intensity.If there had been anything they could have done for their pet, or if they had been on vacation for fun instead of emotional recovery, I would have tried to reach them. On the one hand, I tried to do what I thought best given the situation on the other, I kind of understand how they feel. I don't know - AITA?I don't want to second guess or criticize their decision to go abroad, or their decision to leave the dog at home with the supervision of a paid caretaker. Those were their decisions to make, not mine or anyone else's.EDIT: I have read many of the comments but don't have a ton of time to respond, so here goes.(1) Their major complaint (as far as I can tell - they were in rough emotional shape when they left and things are not better now) is that I did not tell them that the dog had died. AFAIK they don't have an issue with the fact that I buried the dog or that I buried it on their property. (2) The dogwalker was explicitly responsible for the dog, and there is no question that the dogwalker is an asshole for not contacting them immediately. I'm not going to participate in other speculation about the dogwalker because I have no information.(3) A number of commenters have said that burying the dog prevented my neighbors from doing what they wanted to with the carcass. In the first place, they don't seem to have an issue with me burying it and in the second place, that makes no sense. Burying a carcass is not permanent. It can be dug up and reinterred or cremated, though maybe not taxidermied. Also, burial was is a reasonable short-term storage option - it limits oxygen, keeps off scavengers, and keeps the carcass cool (if you bury it deep enough, which I did). I could not put the dog in my freezer (without chopping it up) because it would not fit, even if I emptied my freezer. So I'm really kind of upset about the comments that said I should have preserved the carcass in some other way. In my mind, I could have just chucked the carcass under their deck and left it for them to find, and they'd have had the trauma of finding it after the possums and raccoons had been at it, but not been mad at me. The question is really should I have told them (and probably caused them to return earlier) not whether I should have buried the dog. "
4,Asshole,AITA for telling my fiancee to stop blaming our kids for ruining her body?,3975,m0xylf,1126,"My fiancée (46F) and I (48M) used to both be fitness enthusiasts. She used to go to the gym with me all the time and we shared passions in mountain biking, CrossFit, and were competitive rowers from our college years onward. She used to take pride in the fact that she would push herself to the limit to keep up with me fitness wise. However after our 4 year old and 3 year old girls were born my fiancée began saying that using the elliptical and treadmill at the gym already constituted “ pushing herself to the limit.”She was having trouble with her  “miles” of extra skin ( her words not mine) and said her “gym rat” days are over. She ended up gaining weight, had spider veins, and would say that she was now “ momma” to her kids and that I say I want a “ sexy partner” not just a “ momma” but refuse to plan a wedding.In these past 4 years, she’s bought more and more into what I saw to be very tacky “ mommy motivation” YouTube channels and online magazine subscriptions. Started joining a bunch of support groups and attending working mother summits even though she hasn’t worked in six years.All that’s ok but one of her “ mommy” friends who runs a local women’s wellness magazine asked her to do a shoot about empowering “ mom bodies.”She and about 19 other women ended up having pictures taken of their so called “ tiger stripes” and talked about embracing their mom bodies. I didn’t check out what was put out until I logged on to social media today and saw my wife tagged in her picture and I felt like what I saw was just a whole lot of indecent taste.There was a picture where the two kids’ feet was resting near where my fiancée’s stomach’s “crepe” texture started. My fiancée wrote an excerpt about how she used to be an avid rower and never shy in a bikini but for the longest time after the kids she ached everywhere and could barely get her excess weight and skin into her leggings. She says she felt undesirable, like she felt not valuable because she had lost her beauty and fitness.   But then she tries to dispel it all by saying she realizes that her kids don’t care and think she’s beautiful and that her body made her proud to be a woman because it housed her kids for nine months. I confronted my fiancée and said it was one thing to not feel like a woman but to essentially blame our kids for ruining her body when she made that decision as an adult with free will was horrible mothering. She yelled that this wasn’t what she meant and that she was saying she’s grateful her body gave us children.I said that obviously the picture with our kids’ feet around her stomach was pointing out the cause of her “ ruined body” and it couldn’t be more obvious. AITA for thinking that she needed to hear that she can’t blame others when if she really ruined her body that was her own decision, not my kids’?"
5,Asshole,AITA Airbnb Host Argued Over Review,58,m1knhy,56,"In February, I rented a cabin so I could use the hot tub and get away from home since that is where I have been stuck. I rented it through Airbnb, and if you have used that, you know when you book, you get instructions and rules. Well, when I get there, I message her because she said she would just text the code. When she text me, it was a massive message with all kinds of info, mainly about things to do in the area. Well, I quickly scrolled through the text and got the code at the bottom because it was 35 degrees, and I was standing outside. Later that night since check-in was 4pm, I went to get into the hot tub, it was very dark outside and there was not good lighting, especially since the lights above the hot tub in pictured in the listing did not actually plug in anywhere. There were two steps this lip that stuck out the side of the hot tub that I thought you used to step up into the hot tub that were apparently fold down steps that end up folding out and smacking my leg, making a welt the size of a ping pall ball.I contacted the host to see if there was a first aid kit, and there were none, and the nearest place to get any supplies was 30 minutes away and was just a gas station. The conflict starts after I leave a 3-star review and say what happened above. I get a message from her saying that it was my job to read the rules and it was also not her responsibility to provide a first aid kit. I reported her to Airbnb after she, and they gave me a partial refund then I get another message from her saying she is a SAHM and this is how she provides for her family. I wrote her back talking about how she had annoying post-it notes all over the house with rules, literally on the bed, stove, sofa, and stupid rules like no feet on couch or furniture plus the rules on AirBnB and nothing mention steps to the hot tub. I said between the post-it notes and the rules on Airbnb, it should have been clear the steps folded down since there was not adequate lighting outside that one line in a message that was pages long and was supposed to be door unlocking information I did not adequately look over it. AITA for leaving her a low review since it was technically my fault I got injured.I am adding an edit because everyone is saying read the rules but it was not in the rules in airbnb or on the board of  rules in the cabin she had mention in a text when I asked her for the entry code."
6,Asshole,AITA for urging my niece to change her name?,46,m1dxpe,68,"I (30sM) have a sister who’s really struggled in life. I’ll call her Terrie. Terrie has struggled with addiction, and she’s been in and out of inpatient treatment since high school. She managed to keep custody of my niece (“Diva”, currently 16F) for a while, but Diva was finally removed from my sister’s care when she was in 7th grade. Diva’s dad isn’t in the picture and my parents are in their 70s, so my niece was set to go to foster care. My wife and I stepped up and she’s been with us ever since. Diva has honestly thrived for the past three years. The first year she was with us, she had some behavior issues, namely small thefts. But once she got into therapy, she started straightening up and even became an A student. Her current plan for college is to study medicine and become an oncologist. My sister Terrie has been incarcerated for more than a year, and after some court stuff that I won’t share here, it looks like she’ll be terminating her rights. After that, we plan to adopt Diva. Fast forward to last Saturday. Our family was hanging out in the backyard, along with my friend Pete who is staying with us for a few days (home renovations, not really relevant to the story). We were casually talking about when the adoption would happen, and I brought up a name change. Diva isn’t my niece’s actual name, I changed it for privacy, but it’s something similar. The name is just really questionable and trashy, and it doesn’t suit a young lady as smart and self respecting as my niece. Also, there are concerns that no patient would be willing to choose a “Dr Diva.” Well, Diva said that she liked her name, and my wife pointed out that having a more socially acceptable one would be easier, especially in med school. Diva got worked up and said we were being judgemental and snooty, basically. I said that the world is unfortunately a judgemental place, and “you can’t win if you don’t play.” My wife is from Eastern Europe, and she changed her own name when we got married. She has my last name and an American version of her old first name. I feel my wife knows what she’s talking about, and Diva should listen. Anyway, are we the assholes? We’d never force my niece to change her name, we just think it’s a good opportunity. I don’t want my sister’s crap and bad choices to keep my niece down."
7,Asshole,AITA for wanting my wife to breastfeed our child?,490,m10f0m,416,"My wife and I have two kids, and before the second was born late last year, we had several (3-4) discussions on whether she should breastfeed or not. For context: the first one wouldn't latch despite many consultations with the specialists, so she pumped for 8 months before deciding to stop. We talked a lot during that time about how uncomfortable it was for to have to pump, but given the medical benefits of nursing, she felt (and I agreed) that some breastmilk was better than no nursing. So she pushed through for a few months and I was grateful for that.For the second one, however, she decided from the beginning that if the second one didn't latch, she wouldn't pump because it was terrible for her mental health. I stated that at the end of the day, it was her body = her choice, but I also strongly believed that it would be a missed opportunity for the second child health-wise. I let her know that I believed breastfeeding/pumping would be PREFERABLE and, as the father, I FELT that I had the right to state my opinion. With every subsequent discussion we had on the matter, I would re-state my opinion, but also that it would be up to her at the end.Flash forward to the birth of the second one, and she tries latching the baby but with no luck (\~ 2 weeks). Meanwhile, she's pumping regularly every day. I'm a work-from-home dad so I'm there to help with both kids whenever she needs to get away and pump. Still, she threatens to quit a couple times, and  I let her know that if it's severely impacting her mental health, she should stop since the priority IS being well-enough to be there for the kids. However after the most recent failed attempt to latch, I'm on the receiving end of a VERY ANGRY tirade (I've never seen her angrier, ever) where she blames me for her poor mental health, and how I ""forced"" her to breastfeed and ""guilted"" her by saying there's health benefits to nursing. In her eyes, I should have been supportive of her not wanting to breastfeed the second one AT ALL and I really wasn't entitled to an opinion.AITA for not being 100% receptive to the idea of her not wanting to breastfeed? I knew it would be hard but I also felt that I could at least state my opinion. I definitely didn't want to ""force"" her, but I thought I made it clear that it was her body=her choice."
8,Asshole,AITA for telling a childhood friend to get over her grudge without acknowledging that I teased her?,297,m12htt,329,"When I (24F) was a kid, I was neighbors with Bri (26F) and Tess (24F). The three of us would always play together and had our own club. The club had a points system where we would dock points for things like swearing (“stupid”, “dumb”, “butthead”, etc... counted), wearing the wrong color, showing up late.....Tess and I would often dock points from Bri after tricking her into saying one of the naughty words and it was funny to see her get frustrated. Even to this day, I see it as kids being kids. Bri did tell us as kids multiple times that it was unfair that she was the only one getting points docked. But we were kids and brushed her off. Eventually Tess and Bri moved and we lost touch. I even forgot about that stupid club until present day.I decided I wanted a fresh start for 2021. So I moved to a new city and started at a new job. Lo and behold, Bri is the one training me. She was nice at first until she pieced together who I was. Then she was friendly but distant, while still training me and maintaining professionalism. I did suggest maybe getting dinner and drinks and catching up but she always evaded it. All the while I would see her brag about being vaccinated and hanging out with other people on Instagram.I didn’t realize what Bri was salty about until a recent project. Bri and I were working together with a few others, who started to joke with me about how they’d better watch their potty mouths around me lest they get written up. I was confused until I asked Bri, who, after some “I can’t believe you really don’t know what they’re on about” quips, admitted that she was still annoyed that Tess and I had our little clique and bullied her as kids. I looked at her in disbelief and asked her if she was still harping on about that, close to 20 years later. Her answer: “oh fuck off with that. I told you multiple times that I didn’t like your little game and you wouldn’t stop. Oh wait. Are you going to take away my points because I said the f word?” I didn’t want any drama for the work project and aside from that little incident, Bri has been professional. So I told her I was sorry that the game offended her but she needs to live in 2021 instead of 2002. She gave me a death glare and that was that with her at least.My boss isn’t switching me to another project because she thinks it was just a squabble and Bri didn’t escalate. Some of our teammates think it was funny harmless kid stuff, the others are on Bri’s side but they’re not being mean to me or anything. Only told me they think the game was a bit messed up if you look at it from her perspective.So AITA for basically telling Bri to get over a petty childhood grudge, without acknowledging how I made her feel back then when the game was a thing?"
9,Asshole,AITA to not accept a gift of money from family?,137,m15lus,151,"Hubs and I were struggling financially a few years back and decided to try to flip a few houses for a better source of income. His aunt and uncle are rich, and he went to them to ask for help. They agreed to finance the purchase of a few flips for us. We flipped and sold two of the homes, but fell in love with the third, and decided to try and buy it for ourselves. Aunt and uncle said no problem. We couldn’t get a loan yet so they agreed to owner finance for a few years to help us get some extra equity. The market in our town had a recession and we ended up underwater on the house, so we just kept paying them monthly like they were the bank. All were fine with it except me, because I always feel like they are trying to control people with their wealth and we were letting them. But I got over it because we needed the help. His uncle got sick a few years later and wanted to get his affairs in order, so he approached us about either getting a regular mortgage or selling the house. We decided to stay and applied and got a loan. When we asked him for the payoff amount, it was around $12,000 more that we had thought. Hubs called him and he said it was debt left over from the costs of the original loan and a few missed payments. It sucked but it was money owed so we rolled in into the mortgage. It was a real bummer not having that bit of money in our savings to serve as an emergency fund and we had to struggle a bit the first two years to cover all expenses. But we did and we’re doing well now.Fast forward to yesterday. His uncle called him and wanted us to refi at today’s lower rates and give us a $12,000 “gift” to help. I refused on the grounds that, if he had wanted to help, he would have forgiven the debt when we needed the money and not now when it’s just a way for him to feel better about taking money from us when we we’re struggling. Hubs says his uncle wanted us to prove we could make it on our own first before and that his uncle was concerned that we would have wasted it before. I told him no way was I accepting that money and was insulted that his uncle thinks we were too irresponsible before. Hubs says its free money and we should take it no metter who is offering or the reasons behind it. And that we would be jerks to not accept a dying man’s gift. I still refuse on the principle of the thing and want his uncle to know that we don’t need his money. He says I'm being an ungrateful bitch and hurting our financial future by holding a petty grudge. Am I being unreasonable here?Edits:Ok fine I accept that I'm the asshole. I expected it to possibly be the case. I didn't expect all the downvotes or people getting this mad. That was a surprise. Also thanks for the mean PM's. I never knew that being wrong in a situation  makes you a horrible person overall. And to clarify, the money is only being given to us in the event that we accept his advice to refi, and is to be used for closing costs and to pay down the principal some. There is no extra money for hubs to spend without me. And thank you to those who tried to make me see my fault here without invalidating my hurt feelings."
10,Asshole,AITA for not wanting to pay the rent to my girlfriend's parents?,64,m16swx,158,"I've met my girlfriend last summer. We are both young workers who just started their careers, neither of us earn much at all. Her parents are quite wealthy and have bought her a house outright. Due to covid, we decided to move in together 4 months into our relationship to make sure we can still see each other.Now the lockdown end is insight, her parents started discussing how much rent I should pay them when the lockdown ends. They are being considerate with the price of it, as they are asking only 250-300 a month, when houses around us go for 500-600.However, I think rent is a huge waste of money into the void and my whole life I was planning to save up enough for a mortgage whilst living with my parents. My parents only charge me 200 for mortgage we have going and that's pretty much it which gives me an opportunity to save up. I don't pay any other bills there.Here, I pay for half the shopping, half the bills, sometimes I buy stuff for the house as well to contribute toward it. Making me pay rent on top of it will just set me back in life more, I want to put that money towards my future, which I can do if I move back.I would rather move back to live with my parents, but I think that will hinder my relationship a lot. If I don't live here, my girlfriend won't get a tenant and will just live alone and it just ends up being inconvenient for us and they still won't get their rent.Am I the asshole here for not wanting to pay rent?Edit: Some common questions/more info1. She doesn't pay rent.2. I do pay half of every cost in the house, including bills, tax, purchases of new appliances and maintinance of the house.3. Parents do NOT contribute any costs towards the house and haven't for 4 years.4. House was purchased for her, but it's still in her dad's name."
11,Asshole,"AITA for requesting a small, arguably insignificant compromise from my mother?",8,m1kh8r,18,"Edit: The sleeping pill addiction is the issue not the MS by the wayEdit 2: Okay I believe I'm the asshole about this now and I just called my mom to say sorry and that she can do whatever she wants and I will help out**Context:** My mom has MS, which slows her motor skills down to a frustrating slow pace, I've learned to live with this. She also takes more sleeping pills than you're supposed to daily, and stays up to 5am every night.**Problem:** I'm a gamer, so I tend to stay up to 3am or so every night, so both she and I share the space every night. The sleeping pills pair with her MS extremely poorly and make her into a zombie.Example sentence: ""Hi,,,,,,,,,,,, nicholaaaaaaas..... can... can... can? can youu uu uu go ... to the ssttto,eere and... get,, me.. sssssome icc.c.ce cr.e.eam? (Every night) (The wifi doesn't work in my room so I must be out in a specific area to get it lol)She generally makes me uncomfortable in her zombie-like form, with her waving her arms to walk around the house and eyes been closed. Asking random questions that relate to nothing, generally making me embarrassed to watch my mom act in such a way and be okay with it.So, am I the asshole for asking her to make a small change in that from now on, I don't want her to be sitting next to me while she is on sleeping pills specifically from 2 to 5 am, and any requests she has (her body doesn't work so she asks me to get stuff and do things all the time, which is totally understandatable and I would do the same if I had MS and a son), to text me instead from now on?**Edit:** and this \^ makes sense for both of us since she doesn't like to make trips across the house and her room is very far from where I am, so win-win in my mindI feel like an asshole as it's my mother and it's a rather small thing to stop doing so maybe our 20 minute conversation this morning wasn't worth it (for her). I'm happy since she's agreed but I may have to write it down since MS affects memory. I do love her and she has more good traits than bad. But maybe I should have let it go and gotten used to it."
12,Asshole,WIBTA if I asked my assistant to stop talking to patients in a language I do not understand?,688,m0twk7,125,"Background:I am a dentist and am currently working in an office that I do not own, but have full autonomy over. I am the only dentist working in this office. I have been practicing for approximately 4 years and working in this office for approximately 9 months.My dental assistant (R) has been working for the owner-dentist for approximately 20-25 years. R is a stellar assistant and someone who I am happy to work with. R is efficient, meticulous and in general, a very good co-worker. R is experienced and has a wealth of dental knowledge built up from her time working that makes her a great resource.R often speaks to patients in her/their native language . Which, most of the time, is awesome as R can act as a translator which helps me ensure my patients know all the ins and outs of their treatment and what exactly is happening to their body. I often times ask R to translate my explanations of all treatment options and the various risks and benefits of each option to my non-english but native language speaking patients so I can be sure they are making an informed consent as best I can. My fluency in the native language is passable and good for chair-side directions and basic conversation, but not for complex explanations.Problem:I have started to have issues where patients will begin to ask for treatment options that I have not presented because those treatment options are medically impossible to provide or guarantee appropriate quality. This has, more often then not, led to me having to explain that these treatment options are not medically (dentally?) feasible and disappointing/angering patients. I'm never mad about educating patient but having to be the one to shoot down these options has ended up leading to patient-doctor relationships being rocky from the beginning (which upsets me). I learned that these unfeasible options were being presented by R without my knowledge. This occurred when I walked back into a room mid-explanation and made out the gist of what R was saying in \[native language\].I want to ask her to please stop talking to patients if I can't understand she is saying so I know she isn't recommending treatment without my knowledge. Because if a treatment goes wrong or something happens because we were attempting something that should not have been attempted in the first place, it is my license, livelihood and reputation on the line not hers.Reason I might be the asshole is because I'm telling her to limit interactions with patients and dictating how she speaks to patients?Also please ask for any elaboration if needed!EDIT: thank you for the responses so far! Definitely going to emphasize this as a less ""don't speak your language"" vs more ""please do not offer treatment options that I have not discussed/are not possible"". That being said, one of my concerns is that she will continue to do so in spanish because she knows I am not fluent enough in the native language to ""catch"" her.  Also, I would like to mention that this is not the first time she has unilaterally altered treatment according to her judgement but it is the first time where it is truly affecting my patients' treatment. things like changing white fillings to silver fillings or taking different X rays than the ones I asked for do not drastically alter a patient's treatment or harm them so I haven't pressed it but this is where I'm getting a little ""pissed off"" for lack of a better term."
13,Asshole,AITA for giving my daughter screen time?,11,m1guq5,63,"My daughter is 5 months old, which falls soundly in the “no screen time category”, but hear me out. Two nights ago, my fiancé was watching our kid. He had sports on TV and even though he had her facing away, she kept turning and flipping around to watch it. I kept telling her “don’t watch TV!” in a sing-song voice to try to distract her back to us, but he got annoyed and turned the TV off. Last night, I was working (I work from home) and watching her while he was cooking. I *had* to send an email, and she was screaming and crying and just wanted to be held. So, I sat on the floor, sat her between me and the laptop with her leaning against me, and typed away. My fiancé came over and sarcastically commented, “no screen time, huh?” And I said “this is different.” He said it wasn’t and I needed to not judge him and called me a hypocrite. AITA?"
14,Asshole,AITA for feeling uncomfortable w partner's job?,8,m1iz2q,36,"First time making a post but basically. My partner got a job at a place where some previous ex friends of ours work. I didn't feel comfortable with him working there in fear of any interactions happening between them. They have said bad things about me in the past and my SO continued being friends with them. I told my SO how I felt about them being friends when they talk bad about me and he eventually stopped talking to them. Although I was happy about him getting a new job, I was very bothered that he chose to work there despite me explaining my concerns. We have zero contact with the ex friends but I didn't like knowing they'd be working under the same roof and I admit that I've cried about it. This argument always comes up although SO claims they're there for work purposes and will be professional if anything every happens with ex friends. I don't want to get in the way of him making money so the logical reason would be to let him work there. But I personally feel uncomfortable and bothered. SO still works there till this day  (since they weren't accepted at other places) but am I the asshole for not liking his job?Edit: I am not saying I’m against his job or asking him to quit, I understand that it’s his job and source of income. I just feel uncomfortable knowing the history between our (mutual) ex friends and him. When they talked bad about me, he continued to be friends with them which is why I worried about them working together."
15,Asshole,Aita for asking my friend to pay me for his meal,21,m1bzrh,46,"I have a close knit group of friends that are all in their early 20s. 5 of us went to dinner on Saturday night to a a pretty good place. Not horribly expensive but not somewhere with any entrees under 15 or so dollars. The fake names I’ll give my friends are Bill, bob, Dan and Mary. We used to see Mary all the time but she started dating some older guy now we don’t see her much. Dan also used to come around a lot more but has since gotten kinda weird. When the check came, it was $225 total for the table. We were all going to put our cards down and split it, but Dan objected because he would end up paying more than what he ordered. Bill also decided that we should all treat Mary. So even though she offered to pay, we didn’t let her. Bill, bob and I ended up splitting the Bill 3 ways, and with tip we each paid like 85 dollars. Dan claimed he’d venmo. A little backstory is that Bill, bob, and Mary all make pretty decent money at their jobs. I am currently in between jobs but work in the finance industry and Dan is at the same taco joint he worked at since senior year of highschool. It’s sucks but we are getting to that point in life where Dan is starting to lag behind us. I explained the situation to my mom (I am fine with paying for Mary, but not dan) and she said “what kind of man let’s his friends just comp his meal for him”. I asked bob and Bill if Dan paid them, and they said no. Dans total came out to around 25$, and they said it was shitty for him not to pay but they aren’t gonna harass him for the money. Well I am in between jobs, and personally I’m trying not to overspend when I don’t need to. Bob and Bill said I can try to get the money from Dan and just keep it all. I do want the money, I think Dan was being a piece of crap to not pay. But I don’t know if I want to cause drama in the group by going after this money. Mary said her dad thinks Dan is a scum bag and needs a wake up call on life, so I have every right to ask him to pay. Bill and bob aren’t sure because of the friendship dynamics. Idk am I an asshole if I ask this dude to pay me back for his meal?"
16,Asshole,AITA for saying I want “pure” skin,7,m1ij67,43,"Am I the Asshole for calling nontattooed skin “pure”So I was texting with my friend about tattoos. He was saying that he likes them and wants to get a few tattoos. Then he asked me if I ever wanted any. I replied with “no thanks, I like my skin pure”. After that he flipped his shit at me and started calling me names, telling me that I have been completely insensitive and disregarded the beautiful stories that peoples tattoos can tell. And he started cursing at me telling me it was wrong to say tattoos are evil. I responded by saying that to me, pure means untouched, and that saying I want pure skin means that I want “only skin (without tattoos). I explained that was not insinuating tattoos are evil. He did not seem to care fore my explanation and told me I need to consider other meanings of words and not get so tripped up on the literal definition of the word.So AITA here? I might be because words have multiple meanings. But I also I think my friend majorly over reacted to the use of “pure”."
17,Asshole,AITA because I don't plan stuff to do?,30,m181hk,81,"Am I the asshole because I don't care where or what we eat, or what we watch on TV, where we go on vacation etc. If if my family is having fun I am good. Why is it such a big deal that I don't care. Last night we were going to eat and she asked where I would like to go and I said ""IDK where would you like to go?"" And then a fight with the wife. She said I am an asshole because I don't plan anything ahead of time, or ever, and then we just end up driving in circles until someone chooses"
18,Asshole,AITA for telling someone to shut up?,22,m188ez,32,"I was with my friends at the dining hall. I have a friend who is super talkative and bubbly. I am not like that at all and I am pretty quiet and shy. I was having a bad day and I was super tired and cranky. I was sitting with my friends at dinner and I just didn't feel like talking much. The girl I'm friends with kept asking me if I was feeling okay every several minutes. I tried to just shortly say I'm fine, hoping she would leave me alone.On the way home from the dining hall, she kept asking me a question and at first I didn't respond. She just kept asking so I suddenly told her to shut up. She was quiet after that and we parted ways. I got texts from our friends saying that I was an asshole and they're really angry with me. I tried to apologize to my friend but she only said thanks for apologizing but hasn't talked to me since. Was this that big of an asshole move?"
19,Asshole,AITA for saying I have a son?,778,m0lmtr,153,"Throwaway for obvious reasons!My (38M) friend and his wife have a son (13M) - we’ll call him Alex for this post. As Alex has gotten older, a lot of our friends have started to say he looks a lot like me. We’ve all had a good laugh about it (except Alex but I always figured that was just because of his age!) and it’s never been a problem until now.Anyway, we had a video call with my friend, Alex and Alex’s mom on Sunday. Alex never sticks around on the calls for long because he’d rather play video games with his friends. When Alex started to leave the room, I thought it’d be funny to say “Bye, son!” No one said anything at the time so I figured it was no big deal.I got a Facebook message from my friend today saying that Alex thought it was weird when I called him son because everyone says we look alike. His mom and dad didn’t think it was a big deal but they asked me to apologize. I’ve known my friend since high school and don’t want to cause a fight so I said sorry to Alex and his parents. I also don’t plan on doing it again because I don’t want to make Alex or his mom and dad feel uncomfortable. But is what I said really that bad?EDIT: For the people asking, there isn’t a possibility that Alex could actually be my son."
20,Asshole,AITA for being angry that nobody in my family wakes me up?,28,m148qq,92,"I’ll try to keep it short but I (17F) really struggle to wake up to alarms. I have no idea why but no matter how much sleep I get I can’t seem to wake up. This is bothersome because my family have to wake me up for things like school/ outings with my friends. I do try to set many alarms one after the other for different times, but sometimes my family can hear them from downstairs and tell me it’s going off, because I’m still sleeping, but then just go back downstairs. That being said they often just don’t wake me up. I can see why because it can be challenging (I sometimes claim I’m awake but have no memory of saying it.. must be sleep talk or something) but I’ve expressed how it makes me feel left out when they are all doing their own thing downstairs, and how it makes me feel like they don’t want me around when they leave me to sleep. I have missed or been late to many outings with my friends, because I asked my dad to wake me up if I miss my alarm and he just.... doesn’t. The peak was today when we were supposed to return to in-person school after ages of online. I told my dad/ sister (14F) that I had to go to school, and because my sister was waking up at that time, (she didn’t have to go in today) to please wake me up. He takes us to school every day usually so this isn’t an unreasonable request. But today I wake up again by myself in the middle of the day. I admittedly was a bit upset and shouted at my family, and I feel bad now. AITA?"
21,Asshole,AITA for not wanting my cousin to stay?,8,m1af3n,42,"My (17f) cousin (14f) has to come stay for a few days because her mother was sent to hospital this morning and needs a rake of testing done and will be there a few days. She do have other family in the area but none are willing to/aren't allowed to care for children/ are active addicts/have had their own taken off them. Cousin is not in any way related to anyone on my mams side of the family bar me.I got in the door from school an hour ago, and my mam sat me down and basically said my aunt (dad's step sister) has been taken to hospital and we need to mind my cousin for a few days. I really don't want this happening. On one hand, I understand there's limited choice, grandparents and dad can't take her as theyre in England and like I mentioned, I have a *very* disfunctional family (dad's side).Most of the reasons I dont want her staying are quite selfish and I told my mam as such. She's prone to tantrums, stealing, hoarding food, she's messy and although it's really not her fault, she has nits, which means I'll have to de-flea my room after she's gone. My mam tried passing it off as she's been in and out of foster care her whole life she'll hardly be emotionally all there. I straight up said ""I don't want [cousin] staying, and if she does she will not be sleeping in my room or be anywhere near my things."" My mam and sister told me to stop being a selfish asshole, and my dad is beyond mad that I'm so against this. I'm not really sure if I think im an asshole or not here. AITA?"
22,Asshole,WIBTA for telling my friend she couldn't cosplay on my birthday?,103,m0uxo7,50,"My birthday is coming up soon, and I wanted it to be a birthday shared between my two extremely close friends. Lets call them Kate and Aria.Kate is super into a select few MCYTs. I'm a fan of all MCYTs myself (including the ones shes insane about), but shes extremely into these select few she follows. I brought up how I wanted her and Aria to celebrate my birthday with me. She instantly starts talking about what we should do. She's talking about going to these places, and shes especially fixated on roller kingdom, cool, I don't really want to, but she seems estatic, so one or to hours of rollerskating wouldn't hurt. I've always wanted to try. Then the topic is combined with MCYT. She somehow remembers MCYT during my bday talk, and she says that we're all gonna cosplay. She goes on about who we all will dress as and I was trying to be respectful and let her finish. When she does, I try to say no or atleast ask if we can do it on another day. But she's the type to just completely ignore what she doesn't want to hear and try to just force it to happen, especially when she thinks shes already gotten the answer she wants to hear, whether you said the answer or not. So she's not really hearing what im trying to say. I end up caving and shutting up about it, assuming she would forget or drop it when she realizes how expensive this stuff is. (none of us come from backgrounds with money)Fast forward and shes brought it back up. Shes got parts of her cosplay already (some corners were cut, but it was still there). I want to put my foot down and say no but thats not like me, and shes already excited. If I were to say no, obviously I wouldn't say no to ever doing it. But I would just reschedule it to after or before my birthday. I really don't want to wear all these accessories on my birthday and walk around looking weird. There's absolutely NOTHING wrong with cosplay, but the problem is, im already letting her choose some of what we do. I just want everyone to dress normal. This is going to be my first birthday in years, since for once im actually being allowed to have a birthday at all.So, in short, would I be the asshole for denying my friend permission to cosplay on my birthday?"
23,Asshole,AITA for preferring my daughter wear reusable menstrual pads?,1438,m0cn33,854,"My wife and I both use reusable menstrual pads. We each have a little box with our pads in it (we use different patterns). When our daughter hit 11, we had the talk with her about menstruation and puberty etc. and we had her choose her own cool pattern and bought her a pack of reusable menstrual pads for when she would start needing them.Anyway, about a year after she started menstruating, she asked to switch over to regular disposable pads at school. God knows I remember how disgusting my school bathroom was, and just dumping the products in the bin is quicker and feels “cleaner” so of course I agreed.Over time, however, she now ONLY uses disposable menstrual pads. She’s 15 now. It’s important to me my daughter is comfortable, but it’s also a huge plastic waste. I asked her about it and if she’d consider using them at least sometimes – I didn’t demand it and hope my tone didn’t communicate that, as her comfort is important to me and it’s her period, but I was curious why she switched when initially she loved them.She blew up and said she got bullied about them and that they’re disgusting and unhygienic.I comforted her and told her it’s her body her choice, and I wasn’t going to force her to do anything. After she’d calmed down and we had a good talk about why reusable pads aren’t disgusting, I told her I completely understood if she wouldn’t want to but if she’d consider at least wearing reusable pads at night when she sleeps. She agreed.This was a while back.Anyway, this story eventually came up during a video call with my MIL (don’t ask how, it was a weird day and a long conversation). For reference, my wife is stricter for herself when it comes to being eco friendly or “green” and her mother HATES it. She thinks my wife is some sort of “stereotypical” vegan eco fascist lesbian or something. My wife isn’t even vegan, just vegetarian, and my daughter and I eat meat so I don’t know why her mother feels my wife “forces” it on the people around her, since I don’t know her to be patronizing at all.My MIL LOST it and said we were disgusting for forcing our daughter to follow such hippy regulations and preventing her from being a “normal” kid and then went on a tirade about how disgusting reusable pads are.My MIL’s reaction was obviously over the top, but when I talked about it to some friends to vent, they agreed with her sentiments that we were “forcing” our daughter into some kind of hippy life and we should want her to be more “normal.”My wife and I both use reusable pads so it just made sense to buy those for our daughter as well. I didn’t realize this was such a controversial topic.AITA for preferring if our daughter use reusable pads? I want to make sure we’re doing right by her.EDIT: for clarity since there seems to be a lot of misunderstandings. There were two conversations about reusable pads. The first when she was 11 and we laid out all the choices, and again when I noticed a change in pad usage. This happened years after I had already been buying disposables for her no questions asked. There is no ""repeated"" or ""constant"" conversation regarding my daughter's choices in menstrual product."
24,Asshole,WIBTA if I just let my mom’s husband Uber home after surgery?,48,m0v79u,59,"I’m supposed to be moving at the end of the month. I’ve been severely unhappy in my living situation, so I am finally getting out of here and going out of state. I’d be moving in with my dad, and he is pretty much ready for me whenever. The only reason why I am waiting until the end of the month is because my mom’s husband is getting surgery near the end, and they asked me to pick him up from the hospital and help him as he heals up for a couple of days after. I didn’t see a problem with this.For a little bit of backstory, I am at risk, have not worked in over a year, and my hobbies are mostly just playing video games. I take care of my mom’s dogs, and do pretty much everything for them. I try to get out of bed early (10am~) and I do the obvious chores around the house. Take out the trash, do the dishes, etc. So within the last year, all I’ve really done is just play video games, do the household chores, take care of dogs, and KEEP TO MYSELF. I don’t bother anybody or make any noticeable messes in the household. My mom’s husband is semi-retired, does not do shit with his dogs (does not even feed them, give them fresh water), gets out of bed around 12pm~ and does nothing around the house. He has a failing business that he pretends is something successful. He does not do any dishes, throws a fit if the trash isn’t taken out, and like me, stays on the computer or watches tv for most of the day.He has always made super snarky comments towards me, and has generally been petty and rude. Earlier today, he went up to me and asked “Do you plan on doing anything ever? Besides playing video games?” And I just sat there in shock. I have a plan for when I move, I already have a guaranteed job in the other state. This was my breaking point, I’m still fuming at his comment.WIBTA if I just went earlier to move, and leave him to just deal with his surgery on his own? Reason why my mom can’t help him out is she just got a brand new job, and can’t take any time off just for security. Reason why I would feel like the asshole is because.. he’s getting surgery and I would not be there to help? It’s not a serious surgery, would take a couple days to heal. But I’m tired of his disrespect. Dumb shit like this is the reason why I am leaving. He would have to Uber home or have someone else pick him up from the hospital if I was not here. They would also have to take care of the dogs because they are used to around the clock care and would freak once I’m not there.Edit: I’ve chosen to help him and my mom out, and once I move go no/low contact. Thank you all for your input"
25,Asshole,AITA for asking my gf if she wants to do my chores?,325,m0g8cu,131,"My gf and I live together and use an app to manage the household chores. We have separate finances, also. So, my gf mentioned to me at the start of the year that she was saving up to buy a kindle and budgeting $1 for every day she did all her assigned chores, and $10 if she gets a perfect week. Awesome!I’m not the best at doing my chores on time but I do pretty good. I’d give myself a B grade, probably. But if I don’t do my chores, my gf goes around and does them before she goes to bed at 11 pm (I go to bed around 930 because I work early). I’ve told her to leave them and I’ll do them the next day but she doesn’t. Recently, my gf told me that she was giving herself an extra 50 cents every day she had to do my chores. This was a lighthearted conversation. So the main event, yesterday, she was scrubbing the baseboards in our kitchen and I asked her, “do you want to do my chores for a while so you save up money faster?” And she started cursing me out and calling me lazy and selfish and threw the sponge at me and left. She stayed with her mom last night. I think this is a huge overreaction! I was just offering for her to get her kindle faster and I was totally fine if she said no, but she freaked out! My friends laughed about me wanting a 1950’s housewife which is not what I’m here for."
26,Asshole,WIBTA if I call out my sister for being a hypocrite?,27,m0vm0s,38,"I (15) and my sister (19) still live with our parents. We have a brother (20) who moved out over a year ago, before he moved out he started to spend every hour of every day with his girlfriend and would stay with her for weeks at a time (he was still in high school and legally still under our parents protection), my family and I didn’t like his girlfriend (and still don’t) because he had a plan to go to the military, go through college, get a underwater welding degree and move to the east cost. After he started dating her, through his plan out the window and is now paying rent in a attic with her. I started getting some serous déjà vu recently because my sister has now started staying with her girlfriend for days at a time even after getting 2 new pets (snek and hamster) she has left me to take care of them and only comes back for clothes and a ride to work. I know both her and our brother are/were getting to old to stay here in a house with there parents but what bothers me is that she hates our brother for leaving the way he did and she is starting down the same path. WIBTA, am I justified to feel mad at her or is it just me being paranoid."
27,Asshole,WIBTA if I refused to work because they are overworking me,0,m1cc80,46,"I am a teenager in high school and when I started working it was just wash the tables. Suddenly they are having me wash the tables, the chairs, change the garbage bags every 20 minutes,take out the garbage bags, move all the tables,the chairs, sweep in the middle, move the tables and chairs again, sweep the outside, move the tables and chairs back, take out the rest of the garbage, then move on to the next area and do the same thing all over again(btw they have openly told me if I didn’t have the classes I have they would make me do even more work) I am honestly considering quitting and refusing to work because it is having an effect on my classes. For example I have a government class right after work and lately I haven’t been able to get as much work done because my legs and back will be too sore for me to sit up/stand up straight and It will hurt my shoulders when I move my arm. The teacher notices and eventually yells at me for not paying attention and for not working but when I tell her the school is overworking me she will look straight at me and say with a sneer “well that isn’t my problem is it?”TLDR the school suddenly makes me do 5x the amount of work, making me sore and hurting affecting my classes making teachers yell at me and I am thinking of quitting. Would I be the asshole if I did that?"
28,Asshole,AITA for buying my gf new perfume?,116,m0j9kl,66,"My gf (26) and I (M, 24) have been dating for a little while, like 3 months. She’s a stripper which I 100% don’t mind at all, I actually find it hot af. Whenever she works she wears these body washes and scrubs and lotions and body butters body cream and perfumes… it’s all the same coordinated scents and what not whenever she goes to work, like she has this whole system, and she smells SO good. But she refuses to wear them when she’s not working, and on her days off and when she’s not at work.  She told me she doesn’t want to ‘smell like work’, that it takes too long to do all that stuff (it’s literally just wiping stuff on your skin and a few sprays but that’s her prerogative) and says it’s way too expensive. I mean she really gets the drugstore body wash and generic lotions for her days off and it just does literally nothing for me, like she puts on all that stuff because she knows it’s smells sexy and make her skin feel nice, so why wouldn’t she want to do that for her bf?But I did look at the price once and the stuff was expensive so as a gift I bought her the works. It came to just over $100, and she was really happy when I gave it to her. But when I mentioned that now she has enough to wear at home for me without having to buy it herself she got upset, said to take it all back, and now she’s mad at me. My sister, one of my gfs best friends which is how we met, said I was a dick, but I don’t think I am. So AITA for *checks notes* buying my gf expensive lotions, perfumes and body butters?"
29,Asshole,AITA to promote my business at a wedding?,966,m07om7,351,"I (42M) am a DJ primary doing weddings and small events. I’ve spent years learning about how to DJ and doing it as a serious hobby until making the plunge and finally starting my own business full time. I’ve been in operation about about a year and a half and it’s going as well as expected. I was hired to do a wedding and was very shocked at the response I got after making a short announcement. The bride and groom picked a really significant dance they did alone together at the end of the wedding before all the guests and them left to do a sparkler exit. After the song, there was a moment of silence so I told them who I was, the areas I served, told them a little about my equipment (since I’ve invested in the best stuff) and then mentioned I do all events.Everyone did stop and listen, including the bride and groom, but it was a brief moment and they left to do the sparkler exit. All seemed fine. After it was over, the venue manager pulled me aside and told me it was inappropriate. She said that if I was allowed back at the venue, that couldn’t happen again. Okay, I figured she was being over the top as event planners can be, and I let it go. Then a couple days later I get an email from the bride telling me she was mortified that I stole their big exit and wouldn’t be recommending me. I feel this is a huge overreaction and certainly not worth all the drama. Part of being in any business is promoting, especially to people who have heard what I have to offer.  I’m worried she will leave a bad review for a silly reason that has nothing to do with the quality of music I produce. AITA?ETA: No, the sparklers weren’t lit. Honestly I thought I would be speaking over people as they shuffled out but they chose to stop and listen. I guess everyone thinks I’m the a-hole here and I won’t be doing this again, but frankly I don’t think I “ruined” or “stole” her exit, the hype over these things at weddings are ridiculous. I won’t be refunding as I worked nearly 7 hours and hauled a lot of expensive equipment, and this one comment doesn’t negate all that hard work or my expertise. I did apologize to the bride and offered her a discount on future services.ETA2: Ok. I’m an asshole.ETA3: I do have to add that I resent the implication that I’m somehow less of a DJ because I’m a 42 year old man. I’ve worked hard to get to this point. Since I’m apparently “tone deaf” (clever) I am reconsidering doing weddings in the future."
30,Asshole,AITA for jokingly telling my friend he needs more men in his life?,59,m0mwr4,64,"Today is international women's day. My (32M) friend (32M) posted a picture on social media of him, his mother, his wife, his four sisters, his two daughters, and his twelve nieces. He has no sons, brothers, or nephews and his father has sadly passed away.  All his sisters are content with their daughters and don't want anymore children and  the same goes for him. The photo had the caption ""Grateful for these amazing women who I am so lucky to have in my life. #InternationalWomensDay""He sent me a link to see the post and asked me what I thought. I jokingly said ""You need more men in your life"". He got angry and told me to never speak ill of his family. I told him it was just a joke and that I was just commenting on how he was outnumbered against so many women in that photo. He told me to shut up and called me an asshole. He said he is the man he is because of his mother, sister, wife, neices, and daughters, and wouldn't trade them for the world. Am I the asshole? I didn't have any malicious intent with the statement and know that having loving women in one's life is only a blessing. I myself have three sisters (no brothers), a wife, and a lovely daughter of my own. But my father is still alive and I also have two nephews, so I guess I was just taken aback by the large number of girls in my friend's family and how the only men in his family are his in-laws."
31,Asshole,"AITA for ""teasing"" my sister in front of her friends?",29,m0s1r1,45,"I'm 20m, my sister Amanda is 16. Our parents are essential workers and out of the house a lot. We spend a lot of free time together when we're not in our bedrooms for distance learning or alone time, and growing up we were always pretty close. Not like we have a made up language like some kids do, but we have phrases that are inside jokes to us and can basically communicate irl in ""meme speak"" to confuse our parents. It's hilarious.We're that close. That's what makes me wonder if what I did to make her mad enough to not speak to me makes me an asshole. Even our parents are stuck, so they say it's up to us to settle this.Here's what happened. Amanda has two guy friends, Andy [m18 a senior] and Tom [m17 a junior like her] who were over on Saturday to play video games. Amanda's 17th birthday isn't till *this* Saturday, but our parents surprised her with a PS5 and a bunch of new games on Friday before they left for an essential work trip that they didn't arrive home from until Sunday afternoon [hence why they weren't there]Amanda and I gamed well into the night, didn't go to bed until 4, slept till 12 and her friends were coming at 3. I showered at 1 and by 2:30 she still hadn't, so I reminded her that they would be here soon and she rushed upstairs. The shower started running around 2:50, 5 mins later her friends are at the door. I let them in, they chill on the couch [known them for aproxx. 4 years so this is the norm] about 10 minutes later I heard her leave the bathroom. Another 15 minutes later and everyone's a little antsy, so I grab some sodas and a bag of chips for the guys before going up to check on her.I knock, she says come in, I poke my head in, she's in a sportsbra and jeans with a black thong exposed due to her lack of top. I ask what's taking so long, she says her hair got tangled in the shower so brushing it was a little difficult but she'd be down in a few.True to her word she was down a few mins later. Apologized for the delay, I giggled and said because she was flossing. For a sec she stared at me confused till she got the joke. Suddenly looked like a deer in headlights, turned bright red averted her gaze and didn't joke around with me like usual.Seems like her guy friends connected the dots as well, laughing Tom said how he liked a girl in a thong. Which only made her feel worse I guess. She teared up, called me a dick, went up to her room and locked her door.Needless to say, the guys went home without playing any PS5.Amanda refused to talk to me till almost 9 when she came down to chew me out, and was so embarrassed by what Tom said and she's pissed that I didn't tell him off. I told her it was just me joking around, Tom just went along with it. Apparently she thinks that it was sexual harassment and she wants an apology from me. I kept telling her that it was just a harmless joke and I didn't mean anything by it, but she refuses to speak to again me till I apologize for ""what I did."" AITA?**Edit** Okay jeez I get it, I suck for ""sexualizing"" my sister. That wasn't my intention but fine, I'm an asshole.PS: Thanks u/Pork_Barrel1 for the silver."
32,Asshole,AITA for Suggesting My Partner Does Nothing in the house?,42,m0nzeh,30,"UPDATE: I've realised I'm the AH. Thanks everyone for your comments. It made me look at everything from a different angle.  I have apologised to my SO and thanked him for everything he does.Me (F32) and my partner (M37) have just had a debate as I said he does nothing in the house. I do all the cleaning and Laundry and the cupboard food shopping. We split everything 50/50 in terms of finances but its me that arranges all payments and make sure they're all on time. He does the food shop for the freezer mainly and he also Cooks every night. I clean up after him. He also comes home at dinner and let's the dog out but only on the back garden as I have a random sleep pattern so normally don't wake up till about 1pm. Although sometimes, I'd say twice a week I wake up before he comes home and let the dog out. Hes just completed the census on his phone and I made a comment ""makes a change you doing something."" Now he's pissed off at me saying that he does loads.  I think I do more than him in terms of all the cleaning and laundry. He just doesn't realise it.  Does it make me an asshole that I said he does nothing?"
33,Asshole,WIBTA if I asked my dad to smoke a cigar,0,m17s87,31,"I'm turning 21 this weekend, one of the presents i wanted was a cigar. I want to smoke this cigar with my dad on the weekend but I don't know if I should ask if he wants to or not. He used to smoke cigarettes regularly for like 15 years and he quit maybe 5 years ago. I feel like it wouldn't be right of me to ask if he wanted to smoke one with me since he's finally quit after all those years of trying to kick the habit. Just need a second opinion"
34,Asshole,AITA for ratting my roommate out for smoking,12,m0qt5o,22,"My roommate (S) and exfriend smokes in our apartment. I’ve asked her before to light a candle when she smokes because it smells in the kitchen and living room, and bedrooms. She asked me to pitch in for the candle and I said no because she was creating the smell and it wasn’t my responsibility. My other roommate and I smoke in our rooms and no one ever smells it. S refused to buy a candle and we are not on talking terms (only apartment business) so she smoked and i told my landlord about it. And told that she had a dog w/o paying the pet fee. I’m wondering if I am an asshole for this?Thank you for those who have answered so far. I’m reflecting on my choices. I definitely see how it’s immature and that I was being hypocritical."
35,Asshole,AITA for telling my teenage daughter to stay with her aunt because my older daughter didn't want her in the house?,9035,lzpv8a,3358,"My wife and I have two daughters. Laura (20) and Lily (15). Laura studying away but came home for the weekend. Lily has just had her first boyfriend breakup and it's hit her hard. She's been crying in her room the past few days. Unfortunately Laura has a bit of a windup personality and was tormenting her little sister about the breakup, which only upset Lily more. She was saying things like if the boyfriend left her for ""a prettier girl"" and saying she ""didn't blame him"" etc. Horrible things. We did tell Laura repeatedly to cut it out but she didn't listen, to the point that Lily went to bed in tears. Laura has eye problems. She has been very visually impaired since she was a baby. Her current glasses prescription is -28 and she can't wear contacts. We woke up this morning to screaming from Laura's room. Laura had woken up and put her glasses on, but the lenses had been popped out. Lily admitted to doing it and said she threw the lenses out the window. We did try to search for them outside but they couldn't be found. Laura was crying her eyes out and couldn't see anything at all. She does have a spare pair of glasses but as she only came for a couple of days she didn't bring them with her. To be fair Lily regretted what she did as soon as she saw how upset Laura was, but Laura didn't want Lily near her and begged us to keep her away. My wife's sister lives nearby, and I asked Lily to go and spend the day there, because Laura was blinded and looking after her had to be our main concern. I then got a call from my SIL, saying ""how dare you"" throw her out for ""that spoiled bully"". It's not about spoiling anyone. Laura was blinded and terrified, and was too scared to be in the same house as Lily. It was right to ask her to leave until we could get Laura back to her place where her spare glasses were. I do get that it was harsh to just tell Lily to leave, but what else could we have done when our other child was unable to see and crying in fear?"
36,Asshole,AITA not spliting deadbeat fathers money over promise,56,m0d7qi,22,"Small update : I've seen all your answers and I will share 50/50 with brother, I admit that he did a lot to me back then when I was disfavored and that I shouldn't change that now that I am on the other side of the favoritism even if the situation isn't at all what it was 5 years ago, thanks everyone for the answers ! Throaway,Basically our paternal side of the family is not that great, racist and homophobic both the father and the grandfather.Father was never around due to drug problem and distance and never helped us in life, our grandfather sometimes helped but with blatant favoritism toward males and older siblingFor exemple, my brother got a 7500$ car for his 20th birthday while I got a 500$ cheque for mine, for a specific christmas of 4 grandchildren, brother and oldercousin would get 250, I would get 200, female cousin would get 150 because she's a girl, you get it.I am not complaining because its sometimes money we never expected so we were grateful.After that brother and I made the promise that we would share all the money we would get because we were against such favoritism.(important detail: At this point the promise would probably help me because older brother often got more, this was more of like ""don't worry if you get less, we will share, we're not playing their favoritism game"")Somehow, grandfather recently cared for us and we both got 10k$ to help us in life (pay tuition, afford a caution, etc) I got even 1500$ in addition to clear my debtsRecently, our grandmother died and my father and aunt inherited a large sum of money from the sell of her appartment.But the deal is that brother had cut contact with all the family for 2 years (my thinking is that he is now comfortable in life and doesnt need to be dependable of them) meaning that I am the only one to be in contact and still speaking to them, my father even said that he lost hope with brother.Anyway, father send 10k$ cheque from inheritance to me and nothing to brother, brother hears of it and cites the promise of sharing 50/50, even if it hurts me I explain that I'm not comfortable with sharing everything because :-While my brother has a job, flat and everything to be comfortable in life, I am still a struggling student and would really need that money while he really doesnt depend on it to survive.-I reminded him that before the promise he got a car all paid and that was never shared, meaning if we get the count of everything, his share of the 10k would be something like 2.3k$ which he finds unfair.-He cut contact with all the family years ago, which is different of clear favoritism, they helped me because I was the only one still in contactNow brother is complaining to our mom about how ""he knew I would break the promise someday""So AITA ?"
37,Asshole,AITA for wanting to look after my SOs nephews when he doesn't even want to have a relationship with them?,12,m0mcx8,16,"My SO is from a Balkan country. He came as a refugee to the country we currently live in (UK) when he was young. I met him here, as I moved from my home country to study at university. We have been together for 3 years now and we live together. A few months after we started dating, his brother dropped a bomb. That he had a son with a woman and that he had kept it a secret from his family. His family only found out when she had come to the door of their house to introduce the baby to them. Now, they have always wanted my SO and his siblings to marry people from their home country, going as far as trying to arrange marriages for them. Their parents are extremely racist and xenophobic and for context, they don't approve of my relationship with my SO either.Going back to SO's nephew, SO's mother refused to open the door to his mother, saying that she was wrong, that she didn't have any grandchildren. It was despicable and all of it was because the baby and the baby's mom are POC. Even worse, they have never acknowledged the baby (despite looking like a spitting image of his father), and SOs  extended family don't even know about them. The baby has a whole family he will never know because of purely racist reasons and it is disgusting and repulsive to me. However, my SO was told yesterday that there was another nephew. He will be 2 in October and while SO's mother knew about the second nephew, she decided not to say anything, as she doesn't acknowledge either of them as her grandchildren. Even worse, she has only told my SO about it. Not even my SO's sister or father know about the baby.After my SO told me about the second nephew, I asked him if there was something we could do for baby mom and the two children. I proposed having the children over in our flat so they can get to know SO and build a relationship. He said that those children are not his responsibility and that the father should be the one taking care of them. The same father, who by all accounts is a deadbeat, is thousands in debt, dropped out of school at 16 and has never had a job at 26. We ended arguing and I slept in the sofa. This is making me reconsider my relationship with my SO, as he is showing that he is not so different from his family. AITA for reacting like this? TLDR: SOs family is racist. Ended arguing because of this."
38,Asshole,AITA for laying down the law when I had enough of let downs?,16,m0ilzq,34,"To preface this, I am a recovering codependant and have had trouble setting boundaries in the past and decided to try to set one. I was meant to meet with a friend today as this is the first day that two people from different households can meet outside. He told me earlier that he felt like crap mentally and wasn’t coming out. He has no history of mental health issues and he is also prone to reasons to not come out. Anything from “Got to help my family tidy the (tiny) garden” to “I have a headache” to “it’s raining” and it has been grinding my gears but I haven’t said anything due to not wanting to sound controlling. After being told he wasn’t coming out today, I enforced my new boundary that I use on constant let downs. I said to him “If you let me down 3 times, that’s it. I don’t care what the reason is, if arrangements are not met, end of.” He replies with “Stop being controlling. You are not the boss of me and never will be and if that is the case, I don’t want to see you at all.” I told him I am sick of being let down and this is my way of getting rid of people who do so often. He replies with “You have pissed me off now. I am not meeting tomorrow either” (We had also arranged to meet tomorrow) I said “This is being enforced on all constant let downs and it’s non-negotiable.” He told me he “will talk to me when I am ready and realised how controlling that is.” I reminded him I am allowed boundaries and he told me that wasn’t a boundary and rather an attempt at controlling him and how things are going to go. I informed him that a no show tomorrow will be strike one and he replied with “cool. Guess it’s one strike.” AITA for this? I am beginning to wonder if this is controlling disguised as a boundary. Like I said, I’m new to setting boundaries so I’m not sure.Edit: Thank you for helping me see the error of my ways. I have apologised and now given him some space to rest mentally."
39,Asshole,AITA for not wanting to travel to a baseball tournament several states away if we can't win a game?,16,m0jmhq,26,"I am a coach for my 11y/o son's travel baseball team. The team has been together for over 2 years. We are in FL, so this season, we have already been practicing twice weekly for over 2 months. In that same timespan we have also played in 2 tournaments. We have played absolutely horribly and while we technically have won 3 games, I'd say that we just lost them less than the other team. We are scheduled to play a tournament in a state about 10 hours away by car in 2.5 months. We haven't booked hotels yet, but that time is coming quickly. This tournament would last 3 days and would require 4 days in a hotel. This plus gas, food, and other costs will easily reach around $1300 total for the entire trip per family, if not more.I want to bring this trip not being worth the time and money if we're going to get destroyed because we're playing so badly up to the head coach, but my wife thinks I am I huge asshole for even thinking about not going to the tournament. And before you decide, you should know that even though the kids are only 11, that this is travel baseball and the #1 priority is to win."
40,Asshole,AITA for giving my MIL a Jersey Mike's sub?,1033,lzulu7,522,"So the title sounds so stupid, but my husband's family is being torn apart by this shit. I'll start off by saying I don't really have issues with my MIL. she can be a bit needy and demanding, but she isn't a bad person. FIL on the other hand is horrible, and his main trigger is when he doesn't think we ""respect him"" or treat his wife right.We got married recently, and I wanted to serve my favorite foods at the wedding, lemon chicken and lemon cake. I was aware that not all guests would like that, but I felt that it was my day, and the less food options we had, the cheaper it was. For the average guest, I figured they could just live with it, but I didn't want my MIL to starve and she HATEs lemon, can't even put it in her mouth without gagging.I was trying to think of something she would eat that was cheap and easy. I know the buffalo chicken cheesesteak at Jersey Mike's is her fave fast food meal, and I had a box of M&M's for her. She did give me a weird look, but she ate it. Also I had it delivered, so it wasn't just sitting there and getting soggy. FIL was furious. He said that I am selfish and disrespected him and his wife. He went on a rant about how tacky it was to have a wedding and not take the family into consideration, and that I wasted his money. MIL did tell him to stop yelling, but he called me a bitch on my wedding day.Now FIL is demanding an apology and his golden child isn't speaking to me. Their other child is on my side, and MIL said she isn't going to cause drama, but she does think it was disrespectful, and she would never do that with her own MIL. My husband is totally on my side, and I asked some bridesmaids, who feel like I did nothing wrong, and I was gracious to even get her something."
41,Asshole,AITA for not wishing and buying my mom anything for 8th Mars?,11,m0kp9k,24,"Today is mothers day in my country, and I was going to buy my mother something but everything took the wrong turn.Basically I (17F) had forgotten to take extra money not only to buy her something for mothers day but also for bus to go back home, food to eat or drink before my math course started, for which I have to wait 2 hours because I live in a village, and going back from the city to home than to course isn’t the best option. So when I found that I had forgotten my money I had to take the bus and go home to take some money from my savings, knowing that I would be late for my course. I called my mother to let her know and than got on the bus, but there was alot and I mean ALOT of traffic, I had to sit in the bus with my stomach growling because I hadn’t eaten anything since 10 am, and by that point it was 2pm, I also was late for my course because by the time I reached the station the time was already 3pm(when I normally finish the course) so I had to go back with the same bus back home, and again if it couldn’t get worse, I was stuck for another 2 hours in traffic. I didn’t have time to buy my mom anything, I missed my math course, I was hungry and angry at just the sight of people in the bus without a mask asking to sit near me. So when I got back home, I was extremly tired and angry, the moment I entered the living room it was really cold and being the dumb person I am the first thing I said to my mother was ‘ It’s really cold here’ and went to hug her, my mind was telling me to tell her happy 8th March and the second I wanted to talk she started to say how she was looking if I would wish her the mothers day, and I hadn’t bought her anything, and it was the second time because last year I didn’t too. I looked at her and said that I was tired and I had no money, I was stuck in the traffic for three hours but yet she didn’t care, she started to tell me what they do for me, how she and her sister would take the bus from the village and go to the city to by my nana something. And by that point I couldn’t listen to her anymore, I was about to cry so I left the room and went in my bedroom and started to cry, after some minutes I went downstares to see if there was anything to eat, and she told me what an ungreatful daughter I am. And now I feel so miserable because everything has to be always about them. I’ve been studying like crazy these months and when the time is for dinner I watch something on youtube to relax and my dad starts joking ‘if I can live without my phone’ ‘ I can’t breathe without my phone’ ‘ am I studying with my phone?’.So reddit am I the asshole?"
42,Asshole,AITA for not want to play sports,8,m0jn9u,11,"This happened last night.This is a throwaway, my family knows my real account.   I (15m) an doing cross country and track.  With the coronavirus being around, our school was able to do fall cross country races but not winter track races and spring track races is up in the wind.This is my first year of highschool, 9th grade.  At our school, not sure about others, is that if if you play two different sports one year and two different sports (can be the same two different as first year) and you will get one credit you need of P.E. instead of doing it. So far I have done cross county and track which is two different sports so I already have half of a P.E. credit.Earlier at dinner, I didn't eat (completely different story) but was forced to be with my family and my parents were mad about me not wanting to be with them so to get back at me, that asked about how I was doing in school and for some reason when ever my parents ask that I get scarred and defensive and a bit rude when ever happens, don't know why.  Any ways, my dad asked me about signing up for spring track.  I was surprised they would spring that question on me then, I knew the question was coming but I was shocked about it coming up infront of my brother and sister.What followed was me yelling at them and balling at them that I didn't want to do this, not just because I don't want to run but because in the last marathon I ran for the school, I was 15 minutes behind the person in 2nd to last place (A 5k in 43 minutes).  They were yelling at me for complaint and talking about the importance of being in the team.  They also understand that to much work will make me weak.  Every practice I got to, I struggle to do the warm up laps.  I am not out of space by any mean or over weight ( Around 120 lbs.) and I run every single day for at least 30 minutes and for an hour at practice. My parents understand and don't care that I'll have grade mates on my teams that I don't want to look like a cool infront of.  Mind you I was telling at my parents about it.AITA.  Any help in the comments, thx."
43,Asshole,AITA for making my son apologize to his dad for arguing even though I felt he was right?,95,m076n9,137,"I (33F) have an 11 year old son with my boyfriend. My son has a 46 year old half brother who is dying from liver failure due to a lifelong struggle with addiction. This half brother has been a consistent sore spot for my boyfriend. He had gotten into a prestigious college but was getting failing grades. My boyfriend then helped him transfer to another college but two semesters later, despite my boyfriend begging him not to, his son dropped out. He then started drinking and using drugs and eventually became a truck driver.  I definitely wouldn’t disown a kid over those actions, but it was a done deal for my boyfriend because he said his son was ungrateful for the money he invested in his education. My boyfriend has blown up at his other two kids (39F, 44F) who in the past have tried to assist their brother in reconnecting with his dad.Unfortunately my son kind of got dragged into this drama because once when my boyfriend was a keynote speaker at a local public event, his son came up to us as we were leaving and begged his father to call him. So I had to explain to my son that this was his half brother. My boyfriend gave me the silent treatment after I told him to call his son like he promised, so I dropped the matter. However, through his half sisters, my son has met his half brother a few times and gotten to know him.We recently had found out that my son’s half brother was dying from liver failure. My boyfriend knew his daughters were going to visit their brother, but after his ex called the house blaming him for being a bad father, he refused to visit his son and said he didn’t want me or my son to visit either. When my son found out that he couldn’t see his brother and also that his dad refused to see his dying son, he became very despondent. He finally flipped out at his dad at dinner tonight and started yelling at him and calling him cold and cruel and asking how he could do this.My boyfriend told our son that he is doing this with good reason and it’s not his place to question it. He also said that he should be more grateful and respectful and to watch his tone. I told my son that I agree that he should be more respectful of his dad and his decisions and that he should apologize. When my son refused to do so, I sent him up to his room.I ended up going up and telling my son I agree with his opinion that his dad was being cold but asked him to apologize for being disrespectful and he finally did so but said he didn’t mean it.AITA? My boyfriend is always set off when his older son comes up and I don’t think it’s helpful to any of our relationships to him if my son ends up arguing with his dad, especially because rough arguments was what started tanking his half brother’s relationship with his dad."
44,Asshole,AITA for forcing my online friends to stay in a call with me for 24 hours and then get mad at them for not wanting to speak to me after?,62,m08qog,63,"This may seem bad, but please hear me out. I (17M) have been close friends with a couple of online friends for 5 years. B (18F) and E (17M) and I have met through an online game and have been inseparable ever since. Well, up until earlier today.Now, I love B and E, they're my only friends at this point, but sometimes, we can't get along well. It's mostly friendly bantering, but my god does it get heated sometimes. Mind I add that we are VERY stubborn and competitive.Onto the situation at hand. We've been planning on doing a 24-hour long call since last year, but it seemed to be more of a joke than an actual thing. Last week, the topic of doing a 24-hour long call popped up again, but this time it was serious, and we agreed on doing it this weekend. Fast forward to yesterday morning.We hopped onto a discord call, chatted for a few hours, and it was going actually pretty well... until it hit the 7-hour mark. B had to go on mute for a little while, so there was a short intermission with E. We were both aware of the fact that things were starting to become dry. E told me that this was a good opportunity to just end the call. Being stubborn, I argued back. After a little bit of persuasion, I convinced him to stay and we resumed our game the minute B joined back.By the 12-hour mark, E was REALLY tired of being in the call, and after I explained his reasoning to B, we both started to jokingly bully him. Things got so bad to the point where we all started yelling (a few slurs were being thrown at me), with B being on my side. The argument ended with E staying in the call, though.I thought that we were going to go through the rest of the call without any complaints, but I was wrong. It was around 11 pm for B when she said she needed to leave the call, but promised to join back the moment she woke up (she has strict parents and isn't allowed to stay up). Before I could say anything, E snapped and told her that she was being hypocritical. Another argument arose, but it was quickly resolved: B stayed in the call muted with earphones on.This is the part where shit hits the fan. I thought that pranking them would be a way of easing the tension… So, it's around 4 am for B (20h mark) when I decided to fart into the mic as hard as I can.I guess the fart was too loud because the next thing I heard was E cursing me out and spam of messages from B telling me to quit it because she woke up her parents. Both of them left shortly after, with B being the first to leave. I messaged them hours later asking them what was wrong but they still haven't responded to my texts.So? Am I the asshole? Honestly, I feel betrayed and angry knowing that we cannot go through with any of our plans, and a harmless activity got blown way out of proportion... I don't even know where to go from here- but that's besides the point.TLDR: I forced my friends to stay in a call and when they got mad at me I decided to ease the tension by pranking them. It did not go well."
45,Asshole,AITA I didn't reassure my girlfriend after a work disagreement,0,m1adw0,46,"So my girlfriend is a mechanical engineer, like me, and works in a very male dominated corporate environment. She is still learning the ropes and as a trainee has been assigned a senior engineer to shadow. She attends meetings and other things with him to develop skills and learn how things operate. I also used to work at the factory she is at, and know lots of the people there quite well.The other day she came home very upset, close to tears about something that happened that day. Apparently she was attending a meeting with the senior engineers and they had a problem to discuss so they went around the table to see if anyone had any contributions. When it came to her she didn't have much to say except that it's good to learn etc. The chair of the meeting then responded saying I think you need excuse yourself, this is a boys club. She then looked at her boss and he said yes maybe you should.When she told me this I started smiling and said, Sid (the chair) is a cool guy. She was very upset at that, her face fell further. She said that I am not on her side and she doesn't think I truly love her. I don't know.... Am I the asshole? It was a harmless joke that guys make. Her boss then apologized the next day, saying that Sid had wanted to say something privately but didn't know how to get her to leave, so he made that joke. I think she should be able to handle these things if she wants to work with men. We all rag on each other like that, it's just a joking way. She's got to be stronger and not take it personally. Our relationship has taken a turn for the worse since then but I haven't apologized because I think she is over-reacting."

On Friday I got a note on my door about my alarm clock being obnoxiously loud and disturbing the neighbours and that the alarm repeats every 15 mins until I wake up.The issue is I'm a really heavy sleeper, like ridiculously heavy. I could be at a rock concert and sleep through it, and I usually don't wake up to the alarm clock immediately. This isn't because I'm actively snoozing the alarm, I just don't hear it at all. I've tried the light up alarm clocks, the ones on my phone so I can put them right next to my head. I feel like I've done everything I can... I just can't get up. And I live alone so I can't even ask someone else to try to wake me up. I didn't realise they could hear it until I saw the message taped to my door. I really do feel bad about it, I wish I was able to wake up to the clock immediately so it wasn't disturbing anyone. But I can't afford to not set the alarm at all, and I've spent the weekend so stressed about it. I wish I was a lighter sleeper so I would wake up when my alarm went off. I haven't come up with a time frame for when I wake up either so I can fix this... They didn't leave a flat number so I can't even talk about it, and I feel too embarrassed about knocking on doors to ask. I need my alarm and can't change it, because I genuinely  need it to get up for work. Is it wrong for me to keep the alarm as it is?Edit: I've tried a lot of alternative alarms, so far I haven't found anything else that works. I'm not waking up to the alarm and pressing snooze, I know this because my alarm tells me if I have missed the alarm. I've I usually go to sleep at 10 pm and my alarm is set for 7am."
47,Asshole,AITA for telling my female friend that she looks ugly in makeup?,256,lzwtb3,277,"I'm a (16M) who has a good friend, a female friend, let's call her Sarah.  Sarah my friend, (17F) often puts on makeup since it makes her feel better, despite showing signs of clearly overusing makeup to the point of making herself look worse. I expressed my concerns and said that she looks unpleasant with her makeup on, that guys would prefer her without any makeup any day that she doesn't have to change a thing, her natural face is beautiful just the way it is.Sarah responded with  ""It's me. Let me do whatever I want with my makeup."",  ""Sorry, I  just like doing makeup so"", and  ""I was never really concerned with what other people thought"" after I insisted that it's a shame,  trying to say that she would look so much better without makeup. After that, Sarah took a cold attitude towards me, and I haven't heard from her since.AITA  for telling my female friend that she looks ugly in makeup? IMPORTANT UPDATE: Hi guys, I read all the comments and I wanted to give an update and try to respond to as many people as possible without individually commenting on every single comment. I just want to clarify a few things that I seem to be seeing so far.* **I didn't insult her directly by commenting and calling her ugly.** I suggested that the makeup **""looks unpleasant""** as suggested in the post. I never **DIRECTLY** called her ugly, I gave my opinion since she often **asks** *I didn't do so with the intent to imply that all women are tools that should put on makeup*. **I inferred that her makeup didn't look good.** However, it is not my place to comment on whether or not she should put on makeup. She should do whatever makes her feel good.* I should also note that a lot of times Sarah **used to put on makeup for other guys and to make herself look better.** This does not come from me, nor is it an implication I have made. It is a statement that Sarah has stated in the past. Sarah had a change of attitude when I tried to talk to her today and apologize, she said she changed her idealogy and educated me on why **she stopped putting on makeup to please other guys.**I have since then apologized for my behavior. I think I'm ignorant and have a lot to learn. What I said was not good: and I did something terrible. For now, I think I'm TA. I will reflect. Thanks for all the advice and concerns. I'll try to respond to any comment that directly addresses this apology letter below."
48,Asshole,AITA cause I wouldn't listen to my mum's driving advice?,24,m0a4it,24,"EDITED AT BOTTOM: I just went to go for dinner with my mum it's been raining and I decided to drive my old pickup there we go down a hill on a winding road (speed limit is 70kmp/h Aussie) and I'm doing about 65-70 but no she screams in my ear and tells me she feels unsafe mind you I was driving well to the conditions and keeping everything under control, so once we are down the mountains she starts going off at me saying ""I'm gass lighting her"" and ""why won't you slowdown to make your passenger feel safe"" I explained that slamming on the breaks is dangerous on corners and that I was within all the legal limits of the road but she won't have any of it so now there's this shitty atmosphere around the house cause I won't apologize for making here feel unsafe.TLDR: I scared my mum going round a corner doing everything right and won't apologize for it, am I really an asshole?Please help me out my mum's Lovley and I've never seen her like this so it's serious.EDIT: thanks for the advice I was being abit selfish and stubborn so I needed outside opinions I had a talk and said sorry to my ma and we're all good now again thanks sometimes you need a good smack from reality."
49,Asshole,AITA for leaving wife to go on work trip while she recovers from surgery?,74,m03n7k,108,"My wife (37) and I (45) have four kids under 12. Recently, she had a fairly routine procedure to remove a probably harmless mass. There are three tiny little places in her abdomen where they did the whole thing from, so it really was not anything major at all. I dropped her off in the morning, and picked her up when she called sometime that afternoon. That was five days ago. She seemed a little annoyed that I didn’t offer to stay with her, but she knows that I hate hospitals and would not have been able to be helpful.Now, I did do the right thing and take the day off of work so I could drive her, and I stayed home to supervise the children doing virtual school. My parents, and other family live around the neighborhood, so they have all been wonderful at helping her out. My mom came to watch the kids so she could rest after I went back to work. I also worked on Saturday, so she was kind enough to take them off of my wife’s hands again all day yesterday. Well tonight I reminded her that I have to be gone for the next two days. She threw a huge tantrum and started blaming me for not “stepping up”. I have no idea what she’s talking about - I have made sure that she’s had more than enough help for the last few days. She made some snide comment about still having to do dishes and laundry. I know she was upset that I wasn’t more help with the kids and dog today but I twisted my ankle last night and I can’t help that I can’t put much weight on it. In all fairness, everything I’ve read says that her only restriction is that she can’t lift heavy weights. She said she had a slight fever but I also read that it’s normal and she should be totally fine. I haven’t asked her to do anything that would hinder her recovery. I think she just likes the idea of laying in bed for a while and maybe being babied, but that just isn’t our life right now.Anyway, her current complaint is that I didn’t reschedule my work trip, or rearrange my work schedule last week to accommodate her. But I think that shouldn’t be something that she is upset by since I made sure she had my parents and family around to help her, probably more than I would have been able to! In fact, I arranged for more family to help her with the kids while I’m gone. So I think she’s both being ungrateful as well as being overdramatic over a routine procedure that she should be feeling better from. But she says I’m TA for going for two days even if she’ll have help. TLDR: Wife had very minor surgery. I’m leaving almost a week later for less than 48 hours and have arranged help for her. AITA?"
50,Asshole,AITA for making a vulgar joke about crazy girls in front of my(244) girlfriend(23)?,60,m03yzu,99,"Me and my girlfriend of 1 1/2 were watching the movie Fatal Attraction. It was the first time I had ever seen the movie and my girlfriend has seen it tons of times.If y’all haven’t seen it, it’s about a guy who cheats on his wife and the mistress develops a “fatal attraction” to him. She then boils his rabbit and tries to kill his wife before they then kill her.So once we got to the point in the movie that it was obvious to the audience that the lady is nuts, I said, “Look at how crazy she is, the sex must’ve been bomb”. My girlfriend didn’t seem to get the joke and asked why I said that. I explained to her that a lot of guys say that crazy girls are amazing in bed. She got upset and said that the joke is gross and dehumanizes women to call them “crazy”. I said that it was just a joke and that I didn’t mean anything by it.She then asked me if I thought it was true. I told her that it didn’t matter because I was just joking. She then said that my non answer pretty much confirmed that I think it’s true, (which to be fair to her, was correct) and she asked how many “crazy” girls I had been with before her. I told her that I wasn’t going to answer the question and just wanted to watch the movie. She said she didn’t want to watch the rest of the movie because I decided to be gross and talk about how amazing other women are in bed. I don’t think I did anything too bad.AITA?"
51,Asshole,AITA for declining to proofread my SO's paper?,10,m0bkko,50,"In a LDR, we were on facetime both working on assignments. Mine is not due until the morning, theirs is due in 15 minutes. They finish and ask me to proofread - it's a three page paper on some fairly simple material. They hadn't asked me ahead of time to do any proofreading, and I was working on a technical presentation so first said no, I want to work on my thing. They asked again and I could tell they were slightly upset, so I asked for a few minutes to finish a small portion. They emphasized that they only had 15 minutes left and sounded pretty clearly upset, so I agreed, probably sounded a little pissed, and proofread the paper in that moment. Later, they brought up how that exchange made them feel brushed off and that I hurt them by fighting them on something small that would be a big help. I said I didn't appreciate being expected to drop what I was doing, even if not urgent, with such short notice.AITA?"
52,Asshole,AITA for not removing my son’s makeup when my SIL asked me to because she didn’t want a boy wearing makeup at her wedding?,4114,lzfhuq,1137,"My sister-in-law and my brother got married yesterday.  My daughter was the flower girl and my son was the ring bearer.  They’re twins, both 4.  It was a small wedding and I did my daughter, SIL, and her maid of honor’s hair and makeup.  When I was doing my daughter’s makeup, my son, who my husband had already dressed came to me and said he wanted makeup too.  He’s asked for makeup before and honestly likes it more than my daughter.  I did his just like my daughter’s, just with subtler eyeliner and paler lipstick.  I was done with it when my SIL came in to ask what was taking so long and I told her that I was doing his makeup.  She freaked out and said that a boy wearing makeup would steal the spotlight from her and asked to remove it.  I asked him if he wanted to remove and he said that he didn’t want to.  I assumed my SIL would back down, but she told me to take it off anyway.  He said that he wouldn’t go to the wedding if he couldn’t wear makeup.  My daughter said that she wouldn’t do it either if her brother wasn’t there.  My SIL said I should just make them and I told her that I don’t force my kids to do anything without giving a valid reason for doing so.  I told her that my kids would not be in the wedding if she didn’t let my son wear makeup.  She said she would let him wear makeup.  After the wedding she told me that everyone was looking at my son instead of her and he stole the spotlight.  I don’t get what she means by that, there were only 12 people there including the bride and groom and all of them except the best man and maid of honor have seen my son in makeup before.  Am I the asshole?Edit: Had a brain fart and put 10 people, when there were actually 12 people.Edit:  Got it, I'm an asshole.  I'm going to call her to apologize today."
