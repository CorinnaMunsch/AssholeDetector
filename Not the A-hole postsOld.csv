0,Not the A-hole,AITA For suing my girlfriend after she had my 1967 impala project taken to the scrapyard?,70809,gr8bp3,2789,"I'll try to keep this short. I had a [1967 Impala 4 door]( that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITAEdit: Thank you all so much for the support and awards and everything. I'm glad I have some people on my side. I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life. I've been gathering documentation and stuff and I'm about to head down to the police station and file a report, as suggested by lots here. Once again thank you allUPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait nowHUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice! SHES GONNA BE ALRIGHT"
1,Not the A-hole,AITA for pretending to get fired when customers get a temper with me?,63528,e5k3z2,3663,"I am a high schooler with a weekend job at a coffee shop. My coworkers who work weekends are: James - the owners son, he goes to my school. He's a shift manager but it's not a real formal thing, he's a friendly guy.Danielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too.So sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it's a lot... Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.So James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.So one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.So James came in and was like ""sir is there a problem here"" and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like ""OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired."" I started acting real sad, like ""no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee"" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.The angry guy started to backtrack, like ""It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it"" and James was like ""No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service""Of course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and ""fire"" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences. Anyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.AITA for this joke?"
2,Not the A-hole,AITA for punishing my son after he said something racist?,52905,iagtso,2650,"About a week ago, my (39F) family ordered Chinese food for delivery. When the delivery driver came to the door, my daughter (16F) was taking the cat upstairs to put in her room because he always tries to eat the food. My son (13M)  loudly says, “Make sure the hide the cat from the Chinese guy!” as I am at the door getting the food from the Chinese delivery driver. He very obviously heard what my son said and was upset by it. I quickly apologized and took the food. I told my son that racist jokes were completely unacceptable and very wrong and he refused to admit that he was in the wrong. So, later that night I forced my son to write a sincere apology to the delivery driver, (his name was on the receipt) as well as write a one page paper on Chinese culture and a one page paper on why racism is perpetuated by racist jokes and stereotypes. Then the next day I took him to the restaurant and had him read his apology aloud to the delivery driver as well as give him the papers he wrote. The driver was very appreciative of the apology and thanked me for making my son do it. He then told my son about multiple instances where he had faced racist comments and attacks from people while he was a delivery driver. That night my husband (43M) and I got into an argument about me making our son do this. He told me that it was embarrassing for our son to have to do the apology and that the “punishment didn’t fit the crime”. I told him that it was much more embarrassing for the driver to have to face that kind of racism and racist stereotypes and that our son would get over the embarrassment. I do not condone any kind of hateful thinking in my house, and the fact that my son said that embarrassed me as well. My husband told me that it was “just a joke” and it wasn’t that big of a deal. I feel like I might have over reacted some but I think it’s important to help my son understand how what he said was wrong and hurtful."
3,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for refusing to stop cooking bacon in my kitchen due to my teenage daughters vegan lifestyle?,51395,dkqv29,7576,"Dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but I’m struggling to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one. We’ve always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural Midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. None of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I’m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn’t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it’s not YOUR pan. She asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn’t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they’re colored is so it helps me remember that I’m not to touch them unless I’m cooking vegan. That wasn’t good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is ‘contaminated’ with animal product, and the fridge has ‘bacon grease fingers’ on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she’s asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don’t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it’s clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. frankly I’m on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife’s reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn’t want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it’s specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I’m sorry for her, but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I’m not going to stop eating bacon in my own house."
4,Not the A-hole,Aita for wearing the “joke” bikini my friend got me?,50961,d7yuot,4046,"So it was my birthday couple months ago. Had a party. Got some gifts. My friend “Mandy” for me a “super cute bikini”. I liked it. Said thanks. She had ripped the tags off but whatever. Anyway. Went to the community pool with my roommate. Wore bikini. Got in the water. Roommate immediately is like uhm girl.... I look and see that this bikini is now kinda see thru. Haha good joke Mandy. Anyway, Mandy invited me over to her place to hang out with her and her bf and a few others. Most leave and we’re still hanging out. I’m like hey, what if we get in your hot tub? I go change after them. And meet her bf in the hot tub she’s getting new drinks. I hop in. Immediately, he’s looking at my chest. I pretend I don’t notice and just make small talk. She comes out a few min after. And just looks in shock. Eventually gets in. “Uhh is that the one I bought?” Yeah I love it. I wear it everywhere. Make up some stuff about how I wore it to the beach, some party with lots of guys, etc. and she’s just like “oh”. We’re in the tub for 20-30. Eventually get out and change. She approached me after and was like. “Uhm I’m sorry thought you’d notice. But it goes kinda see thru”. I’m like yeah I know why’d you buy me a ducking see thru bathing suit? “She’s like it’s a joke. Wait you knew? So you just spent last 30’ flashing my bf on purpose?” I reply I’m just wearing my birthday gift from her. Anyway. Aita?"
5,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my son he deserved his gf breaking up with him?,47776,daglhs,4019,"So my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. She was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. She was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn’t lift a finger to go visit her. I tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. He said no. And my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. I spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he’d have to fly over to her country too. Which is fair enough. He said no, he didn’t want to fly or travel anywhere. My son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. Last week, he told us she’s dumped him. I went on her fb page as we’re all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she’s upset it didn’t work out but these things happen, so we’re on good terms) and looks like she’s with a new guy already. Me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. I confessed to them both that I actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. He did not treat her properly and I hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. I said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time. Wife and son are very upset that I said this. Very very upset and my wife says I am being horrible. AITA? I stand by what I said."
6,Not the A-hole,AITA - Telling my parents to pay me back my college tuition if they want a relationship,47558,i9pm5u,2803,"I was raised by parents who believed (religiously and just culturally) in rigid gender roles. Dad should work, mom should stay home with the kids. I’m the only girl and have 3 brothers. Because of their expectation I’d stay home with kids, they never valued my education, educational achievements or emphasized things beyond domestic skills. I’m the second youngest. By the time I was in high school, my two older brothers had gone to the college of their choice, with my parents fully covering tuition, books, an off campus apartment and other living expenses. They eventually did the same for my younger brother. I was told I wasn’t allowed to apply for college.I did so in secret and got accepted with a partial scholarship. I didn’t tell them I was moving out until a week before I left, with essentially nothing but what a few friends gave to me that their parents bought “them” for college. I took engineering, and had to work, take on debt and struggle.My parents and I have barely spoken for years. I’m married now and expecting our first child, and they asked to meet up. We met at a park, and they said they were “sorry if they caused me pain” but would like a relationship now. I asked them specifically what they were sorry for. They wouldn’t elaborate and just said they wanted to move forward. I said that wasn’t sufficient. In the end, I said they could prove they were sorry by forwarding me the $100k my degree and college expenses were, just like they did for my brothers. My mom burst into tears, my dad said I wasn’t being serious and I just left. Since then, I’ve been getting calls from my brothers telling me I’m being immature and hurtful. I don’t think so at all."
7,Not the A-hole,AITA for sleeping naked on top of the covers to teach my flatmate's gf a lesson?,47420,d10cpy,6170,"New to reddit, please bare with. So I (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. Up until last week, things were perfect between us. However, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. She and I have quite a lot in common, and I actually like spending time with her. However it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. Now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; I'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. However, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if I want coffee. I sleep naked. Every time prior to the last one, I've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. I always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says ""but I didn't"". When she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, I intentionally slept on top of the covers. Sure enough, she barges in at 7AM, begins to ask if I want coffee and sees my you-know-what. She immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My mate later pulled me aside and said I was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that I'd ""threatened"" to do it before (I literally just said ""okay but what if I had no covers and you saw everything"" before). They're now framing this to others that I'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how I get my rocks off, and I'm kinda seeing how it came off that way. AITA for doing this?"
8,Not the A-hole,AITA for despising my mentally handicap sister?,46794,awyi8k,2723,"The title makes me sound horrible but hear me out.&#x200B;My sister is severely autistic. She requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. She is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. Despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.&#x200B;I hate her. That should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.&#x200B;I was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. Even since I can remember the world has revolved around her. I was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. All of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when I complained. Even when I was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me I was in the wrong.&#x200B;Along with this I am expected to take care of her and drop everything I do for her. I can never make plans with friend because my parents ""expect"" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. Even when I do somehow get time to myself I am required to leave if they need me. If i do not then I am punished. The recent example of this is when I went to see the new spider man movie, and was ""grounded"" because i turned my phone off in the theater.&#x200B;It seems as if I am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. This last week I was chosen to give a speech at a school event. I was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. Anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.&#x200B;I've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. While talking about colleges with my father, he joked that I should get a degree that pays well so when their gone I can take care of my sister. I don't know why but this caused me to break down. I cried and screamed about how it always about her. I'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that I'm expected to be her ""slave"" for the rest of my life.&#x200B;I've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. Am i the asshole here?&#x200B;Edit/Update kinda:Wow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. I never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. Thank you all. After thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that I don't despise my sister. It's not her fault that she was born the way she is. My parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but I was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. They have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. My parents want to talk to me but we have decided it's best I leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue. Thank you all again for the love and support through this <3&#x200B;I'll send an update your guy's way later this week if people are interested. "
9,Not the A-hole,AITA for switching to regular milk to prove my lactose intolerant roommate keeps stealing from me?,46212,hvcvtt,1429,"Me and 2 other guys share an apartment together and we split all the bills. The only thing we don’t split costs on is groceries. Everyone’s in charge of buying their own food and we don’t touch whatever doesn’t belong to us in the fridge. We put our names on everything so no one gets mixed up. This issue has been going on almost a year and I’m sick of it. One of my roommates, R, keeps stealing my food. I get home from work and containers with my leftovers are sometimes missing (they have my name written on it), or my stuff finishes too quick. My gallon of milk for example. I buy almond milk because I like the taste. But it seems to finish after a week even though I’ve only drank once or twice. I confronted R about this lots of times and that’s caused a lot of arguments. He outright denies it and tells me I’m crazy even though it’s so obvious. My other roommate and I carpool together because we both work the same early morning shifts around the same area so I know it’s not him. It’s always after we get back home and R’s already left for work that I notice my food’s gone. My roommate’s also had a similar problem but not as often as I do. I’m guessing cause R doesn’t like what he buys.The funny thing is R buys a lot for himself and is even more stingy about his food. He will literally point out what’s his when he comes back from grocery shopping and tells us not to touch it.Last week, my milk was nearly empty again and I got fed up. I went to the liquor store and bought regular dairy milk. I drank what was left of my almond milk and refilled the gallon with the one I bought. This was to catch/prove R is the one stealing since he’s lactose intolerant. The nxt day, Saturday, we get back from work and R is pissed. He yelled at me that he was stuck in the bathroom for 40 mins with diarrhea because of my milk; he was using it to make a shake. I only responded with “So then you’re the one who’s been stealing?” He freaking exploded. Yeah he admitted he was “sometimes” drinking my milk and eating my food but he was more mad that I switched milks than the fact that he was caught. I told him I wouldn’t have done that if he’d just stopped taking my stuff from the fridge or at least told the truth instead of tryna make it seem like I was making it up.My roommate backed me up and thought it was kinda funny he got payback for stealing from us. It’s a little tense rn and my roommate told me R is trying to convince him to agree to kick me out. Little does he know we’re both looking to move somewhere else together cause we are sick of his shit.  I told some buddies what happened and a few think I was an asshole for that. I feel like I’m not in the wrong here. He was taking my food and not even owning up to it and I wanted to prove it, does that make me TA?"
10,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my girlfriend to shut the fuck up after she insulted my sisters thighs?,46098,fzvxw7,2239,"I’m 30 and my 12 year old sister is living with me right now because mom and pops are vulnerable so it made more sense for me to care for my sis for the time being. She is a really great kid and tbh I feel in a lot of ways like she’s my own kid because my mom and dad don’t speak English so I kind of had to raise my sis in ways that they couldn’t. Hard to explain but I’m sure anyone with a secondary culture will get what I mean- my mom and dad are great parents but having an English speaking person to guide you through shit when you live in an English speaking country is invaluable imo and my sister trusts me with stuff she won’t necessarily trust my parents with. Anyway my girlfriend was FaceTiming me and my sister walked past in shorts and a t shirt cuz it’s hot. My ~~sister~~ gf waited til my sister had left the area ( but not the room) and made a face and said ‘maybe feed her less OP, her thighs are kinda chunky’ I saw red and told her to shut the fuck up (just came out my mouth) and immediately ended the call. My sister is a bit chubby but ffs who says stuff like that about a 12 year old girl. Literally. Everybody. I. Know. Has been texting me that I’m a POS boyfriend and that how can I disrespect my gf like that. I am expecting an apology from HER but to my shock everybody is expecting ME to apologize. So Reddit, AITA?"
11,Not the A-hole,AITA for giving my ex wife a large amount of money I won despite the anger of my gf?,45410,b43t53,5437,"I recently won a ‘fuck you’ amount of money. I won’t say exactly how much but it’s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It’s enough to change the life of myself and my family. My ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. She was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She’s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I’m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven’t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. Long story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I’m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I’m not *in* love with her. We’ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I’m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don’t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?"
12,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling coworkers extremely bluntly why I'm not participating in the office weight loss bet?,44489,jhwisp,3255,"Someone got the brilliant idea to make an office diet bet due to COVID gains, with people pooling in their money to see who can lose the most weight by Thanksgiving. I am one of 7 people not participating. Lots of preggos, some bodybuilders, and people who maintained their weight who aren't interested. Since I've visibly gained, they thought I'd want to participate. I didn't. Jen, in charge of everything, kept dropping by to remind me to turn in my form and my money.I  said ""No thanks."" Jen wouldn't drop it. Other people got involved, asking me why not all the time, it'll be fun! Don't be scared, I'd ""feel better"" and ""look better"" (I told them no, I wouldn't) and it's a great way to bond, we're all in it together, it's like Weight Watchers!""I'm not interested,"" and then eventually, ""I. Said. No. Drop it."" They decided I wanted them to convince me. Two weeks into the bet, they tried to trick on the scale to ""shock"" me. I contacted HR, people finally backed down. I'm eating my food one day (rice and beans), people sitting with me start dropping hints that how they feel so much better now that they aren't eating carby comfort food all the time. I said ""I'm glad you feel better.""They took this as a sign that I ""knew"" I'd ""feel better"" again and started up saying I could still join in. I finally fucking snapped and said ""You guys suck. I'm a recovering anorexic. I get one whiff of competition and start starving myself for days and start puking up what I do eat until I'd have to get my third oral surgery to remove rotting teeth. Does that sound worth it to you?""Chorus of ""wow"" and ""we were just joking.""I said ""No, you weren't *just joking*. Congratulations, by the way. After you all wouldn't stop, I weighed myself for the first time in seven years and didn't eat for two days. Does that make you all *feel good*?""None of them would look me in the eye, so I just went home for the day. I got a call from the women in HR, who were shockingly supportive of me. One of the bodybuilder guys stepped up and said he's witnessed a lot of the harassment and he doesn't blame me for my outburst. A few others did too. However, they had to cancel the diet bet (I didn't ask them to) and people are blaming me. Saying that I can't take a joke, it wasn't ""that deep"" and the girls present said they no longer feel ""safe"" working with me because I obviously have mental issues. One of them made a big stink about ""politically correct bullshit"" and how I'm the typical hypersensitive milennial. I go back and forth on this all day, thinking I should have just swallowed my anger and gone back to HR or just stopped eating lunch in the office or whatever. I didn't mean to ruin anyone's fun but I also feel justified in pushing back on their harassment.AITA?"
13,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling the girl who kissed my boyfriend for a play that she is desperate and pathetic?,44252,dtg4jw,4302,"I (19f) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend is on the same course. My boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. He gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. I'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.However, there's one girl in our class, let's call her Victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. She goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. I know this is the case, because I've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.I've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and I don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. However, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. I rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. She was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him I was there too.Victoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. I snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. You're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'She looked super embarrassed and walked away, and I later heard she'd gone home crying. I feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. AITA?Edit: She 100% knows that I am his girlfriend, I have heard her talking about me being his girlfriend before."
14,Not the A-hole,AITA for jumping out of a bathroom window to avoid my mom’s attempt at forcing a reunion between me and my ex fiancé?,43709,efcc8u,1756,"Some backstory: I had been dating my ex fiancé Sarah for four years. We had been planning to get married in November 2020 but I found out at the start of this month that she cheated on me. She begged me to give her another chance but I broke it off. The problem was that being cheated on is, in my mind, completely emasculating and humiliating. So I never told anyone that was the reason we broke up. For obvious reasons, Sarah also didn’t tell people we broke up because she cheated. So people have “blamed” me for the breakup, including my mom. They just see that I dumped her out of the blue. I’ve gone very strict no contact with Sarah after I discovered she was cheating on me. Sarah has been talking with my mom and has convinced her that if we could talk one more time, we would be able to reconcile. My mom has been applying hard core pressure on me to talk with Sarah but I’ve explained that there’s no chance we will ever get back together. So tonight I go over to my mom’s place because she’s hosting family for Christmas Eve. I’m there for a bit talking with my aunts and uncles and cousins when the doorbell rings and I can see it’s Sarah. I ask wtf is going on and my mom says she invited Sarah so we can work this out in the spirit of the holidays. I’m pissed now because the only way to explain my side of the story is to tell everyone I was cheated on. Complete humiliation in front of my whole family. So as my mom goes to the front door, I go into the bathroom. My mom starts knocking on the door saying that I need to come out and talk to my ex like an adult. I say fuck it, kick out the window screen and get in my car and go home. My mom called a short while ago saying she’s cutting ties with me over my behavior (she’s really fixated on me jumping out of a window) and that Sarah will always be like a child to her. My sister called me after to ream me out for ruining Christmas. I broke down and told her that Sarah cheated on me which is why I dumped her and didn’t want to see her under any circumstances. She called me a big asshole who was lying to cover for myself.  Am I really in the wrong?"
15,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my brother not to bring his boyfriend to my wedding?,43065,cs0bfh,4534,"Ok this is the worst. I’m losing sleep over this.I’m getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and I cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.My brother is gay, but my family doesn’t know, only me and my parents know. I come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century’s mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.So my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, I’m so happy my brother found a great guy. But it’s kind of a secret, as he hasn’t told my family he is gay.I’ve been telling him for years that he should come out, cause I know it stresses him a lot, and I think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus I bet a few family members already know anyway.But he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won’t accept it and it will be a lot of drama. I see the opposite, I see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. I have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn’t accept my brother being gay.Anyway, that’s his decision not mine, so for now he won’t say anything.Until a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. I was not expecting that to be honest. So he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.If it was any other occasion I would be supportive obviously, but I don’t think my wedding day is the day to do that.  Imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. And I don’t want to get the attention away from my fiancée, that’s her day. And I dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and I think it’s a pretty good reasonI asked him why my wedding day, he said it’s because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. This is killing me. I would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if I had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and I can’t do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. I didn’t even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worseWith a heavy heart, I asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that I hope he understands me. He  started crying and left my house without saying anything.Next day I got a text and he said “ dont worry, going alone”. I tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don’t seem to know what’s happening because they didn’t say anything.He eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between usThis is the worst situation of my life, am I the asshole for handling it the way I did?PS 1: I wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!PS 2: Thanks for the gold and stuff!Update: spoke to fiancée, couldn’t keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.Clarification: I know it won’t be my brother that would cause trouble. The trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. Doesn’t matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.I don’t want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. Literally every other day of my life I will support my brother’s decision to come out. Even at the wedding, I would obviously defend him. But the point is, NOT AT THE WEDDING. Also, MY BROTHER IS NOT THE ASSHOLE. Not at all."
16,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling a social worker the real reason my sister wants a foster kid?,42231,hsdpho,2113,"So this is a throw away account. While my sister doesn't use reddit, we have mutual friends who do.I'm a 28F and I have a sister (36F) For the sake of story, I'll just call Jane. Jane is married to ""Bob"" and they have two kids, boy and a girl. My niece and nephew are wonderful kids and no trouble at all. They fight as siblings do but nothing big. I love them. Now for about two years, I did live with my sister. It was a miserable time that really effected our relationship. She saw me as free labor, money and babysitting. Even when I managed to get a small part time job, she demanded I hand over nearly half my pay or get out. It was hell as she took completely advantage of me. I moved out as soon as I could and we have little contact outside of family gatherings.Now after I moved out, she started complaining how ""She has no help with the kids and never gets a break!"" I babysit sometimes but I have made it clear, just cause I am off work, doesn't mean I want an 8 hour day with my niece and nephew.Anyway she started talking about how she wanted to foster a kid. Not a kid but a teenager. I pressed her for more info on this. She wants to adopt a teenager so she has a live in babysitter for her kids. This is her logic: ""I want a kid around 16 or 17, you know someone who may have been in the system for awhile. They can share a room with your nephew (she only has a three 3 bedroom house) or sleep in the garage. They can help me with house work, chores, cook and help me with my business.(She bakes and sells cookies) Also babysit the kids so me and Bob can go out sometimes or have some alone time. They'll be so grateful for a home and won't complain. I won't have to pay them at all. And then when they turn 18, I can just sign up for another foster kid! A teenager will be so much easier than a little kid, they will be grateful just to have a roof, food, siblings if they have been separated from their real ones and clothes.""I was horrified! Told her it was a horrible idea! She didn't listen to me. She went on with it anyway. About a month ago, a social worker showed up at my apartment to ask me some questions about my sister. She had put me down as a character witness or something like that. I immediately told the social worker why my sister really wanted to foster a kid and how she treated me when I lived with her. The lady thanked me.My sister called crying saying that she wouldn't be considered for any adoptions or fosters. The social worker told her that they felt her home and her weren't a good fit. She asked if I said anything and I told the truth. She went off on me, hung up and we haven't spoken since. She has sent some angry texts. A couple family members are on her side. They think foster kids are fucking dogs or something and would be so happy just to have a roof and would gladly do all the housework.So AITA here?Edit: So wow! I didn't know my post blew up like this till I got home from work! Thank you everyone for the kind words, messages and awards.  Remember no child is in control of the circumstances that may have landed them in the foster care system.  They are children and still human. They deserve a loving home and care.  Do right by a foster kid. And thank you again.  Feel free to message me or chat if you like. "
17,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking moms boyfriend to stop trying to parent me?,41629,cwxh47,4444,"**EDIT: THE BOYFRIEND DOESNT LIVE WITH US AND DOESNT PAY RENT OR BILLS. HIM AND HIS DAUGHTES SPEND TIME HERE AND PAY ONLY FOR THEIR FOOD: SOMETHING I DO AS WELL*** My dad died suddenly about a year ago, and my mom found this really nice guy that she’s started seeing. I’m 23M and going into my final year of college. My moms boyfriend has two daughters ages 15 and 13. My mom has stepped in to be a mother figure to them, and the boyfriend has stepped into my extended family becoming everyone’s favourite uncle. And while i’m glad everyone else is comfortable, i’m not. He isn’t a bad guy, I’m just still grieving my father, and it feels like he’s trying to replace him. He tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn’t because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. Boyfriend thinks it’s only fair because i have siblings now. I think it’s ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. He’s trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. They aren’t lacking for anything but he thinks it’s only fair because ~family~. I live in the basement of my moms house. I have since i was 15. When you come in the front door there’s a door to the basement and the stairs to go into the house. So it’s pretty separate. So last night i was DDing for some friends and got home at 2 am. I had nothing to do until 3pm today since classes aren’t until next week and my new job starts in 2 weeks. So this has never been a big deal with my parents. I shot my mom a text and went to bed. Tonight though, man, boyfriend flipped. I got a lecture and sent to my room and “possible loss of car privileges.”I snapped and laid it out for him. I told him i’m leaving the city after i graduate, i told him i’m glad my mom found a new partner but that i am not and will not be looking for a new father figure and he needs to respect that. I told him our relationship won’t be father/son for some time, and that he needs to respect me as an adult or that i won’t want to have a relationship with him. He told my family and they think i’m the asshole. AITA?"
18,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling my Dad he isn't getting the inheritance he's expecting?,41569,dgfkt3,3304,"My mother died when I was 16. My dad married another woman two years later.My grandparents, my dad's parents, HATE my stepmother. I really don't like her either.Even after my half-siblings were born, my grandparents never warmed up to her.My grandparents are quite wealthy. My father has been banking on this inheritance for a while. He has even been not paying into his retirement because he's so sure that he will inherit the millions.I just found out on Saturday that I'm getting the majority of my grandparents estate. My father is getting a token amount of $50000 so he can't dispute it.My grandparents made me promise not to give out any money after and I intend to keep  my word.But I do feel really guilty that my father just spends his money as it's coming in because he's relying on money he won't get.I also found out my dad is in a lot of debt.AITA for not telling him?"
19,Not the A-hole,AITA for keeping my website up after being asked to remove it?,41414,cbybhq,2330,"**UPDATED 7:50 PM:** Holy crap! Thank you for the outpour of support, everyone. I never thought posting this in an online community was going to reach the right eyes so quickly! I had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when I checked back in after work. Several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on Reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. Apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.&#x200B;My intent was to answer more questions since I wasn't able to do that while at work. I was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however I've been told not to continue further discussions beyond what I have already posted if I wish to pursue a civil suit.&#x200B;Just a couple things I want to address in my update here. Some people are saying I'm leaving out details. My original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. I had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so I apologize if it looks like details have been left out. I did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept. Lastly, my son is now back with me. There was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we're together now and that's what counts.&#x200B;I'm sorry if I didn't respond to your comment or private message. I'm still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read. Truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, words of encouragement, and advice that you sent my way. I can't even begin to put into words how grateful I am. Again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.&#x200B;\---------------------------------------------&#x200B;Back in November 2018 I was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. It was the most humiliating thing I've ever experienced. I later learned at the police station that I was being charged with multiple felonies. This came as a huge surprise. Luckily I was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. For $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, I was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. However it cost me everything and I was unable to pay my bond. This resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. At a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and I ended up having all my charges dismissed. When I finally got out I learned that I had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. His mother is a heroine addict and I haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. They wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.&#x200B;Since my release, I've learned that I can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that I was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. I've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. They took down my info but never followed up. So what I did was create a website sharing my story. I also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. Literally the only reason why I was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. If the detective had done his job, he could have verified that I wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. This is what pisses me off the most. My life was ruined because of a lazy employee.&#x200B;I'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. I live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. My web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. I received a cease and desist letter recently, which I showed to my attorney. He said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything I had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. Yesterday I received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. He apologized, stating ""mistakes can happen."" They then talked to me about my website and asked if I could remove it. I said I would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. Suffice to say that isn't happening.&#x200B;After the visit I received, I'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. I don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. My friends think I'm being spiteful and have suggested that I just delete it. AITA for keeping my website up?Edit: Grammar"
20,Not the A-hole,AITA for ruining both my parents marriages for disowning me?,41042,cohdqj,2352,"I am the  by-product of my parents extra-marital affair. Both of them had spouses at the time. My birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when I was conceived so there was no way I was his. A few months after I was born they decided not to divorce. I was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.Both my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that I am adopted by my grandparents. Recently I decided that I wanted to know more about my dad's family and I sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so I could get to know him. Well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over Skype. They both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. Well I did pretty much the opposite. I contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. She is now divorcing him while on my mother's side I told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother. Currently my siblings on both sides lives have been upturned and after the satisfaction has worn off I feel like I unnecessarily hurt them through my parents. AITA for ruining my parents marriages?"
21,Not the A-hole,Aita for telling my brother he got exactly what he deserved when he pushed his girlfriend away for being a “gold digger”?,41027,jms4y3,2868,"My brother is a very hardworking man and at 27 he is now very wealthy and doing well for himself. He’s been with this girl for six months and throughout the time we have gotten close because we both like hair, makeup, and shopping. I never knew there was anything wrong with their relationship except when she texted me last week I saying she would love to hang out but thinks it’ll be inappropriate because her and my brother broke up. I asked her why and she said she was sick and tired of “auditioning” to prove she was with him for the right reasons. She went on to say that my brother is paranoid she’s after his money so he would test her like 1. Leaving out his bank statements on their bed and getting upset when she picked it up 2. Going out to eat at high end restaurants he requested and leaving his wallet on home at purpose to make her pay the bill and prove she’s not going out with him for money 3. Never buying her gifts and questioning her when she asks why he doesn’t. I was shocked so I had to hear my brothers perspective. We spoke and he told me everything she said was true and that there’s nothing wrong with making sure his girlfriend is with him for the right reasons. He said he left his bank statements on the bed and was peeking through the door to see if she would be curious and when he saw her pick up the papers he knew in his gut she was using him for his money, so he set up the restaurant idea to see if she would get upset at paying a 500$ bill which she was. I asked him if he thinks her being an elementary school teacher could’ve contributed to her being upset at a 500$ bill at a restaurant he wanted to go to and he said no. He said the straw that broke was when she asked him why he hasn’t bought her a single gift since they’ve started dating when she bought him a gaming console and new rims for his car and he knew she was just discretely asking him to buy her an expensive gift. He confronted her and said he thinks she’s with him for his money so she said let me do us both a favor and dumped him and blocked him. He’s upset about the “gold digging bitch” and when I laughed he called me an asshole. He said I would never understand what’s it’s like being a rich man and being used and I get that concern, but I told him if he thinks any woman will be okay with his tests and auditions he’s delusional as hell. If he doesn’t want to be used for his money he should start dating people as wealthy as him or leave lower income people alone if he’s not going to be genuine in his relationships unless they pass his “test”."
22,Not the A-hole,AITA for shouting at my ex in front of my daughters?,40977,htmhgb,2336,"I (37M) have three girls; 8, 10, and 12. Their mother walked out on us for another man when our youngest was around 4. My ex still stays in contact, though, and pays child support.A few weeks ago while doing laundry, I saw red spots on my oldest's underwear. I asked her if she knew about it, and she cried and told me she tried to call her mom, but my ex didn't call back. She'd been stuffing toilet paper in her underwear, hoping that would work. I explained to her that periods are nothing to be ashamed of, and found some great resources online for us to review together. I took her to the store to pick out brands of feminine products she wanted to use (she picked Playtex Sport because she's a gymnast). After we were done, I decided I should do the same thing with my other two. My 12yo volunteered to be part of preparing them, and we made a whole night of it; it was wonderful, and I learned a lot. I even learned what a menstrual cup is, and how they benefit the environment.The other day, my ex called back. I'll usually arrange a video chat and leave the room so they can have some alone time, and when they're done chatting, I'll come back in to talk boring co-parenting stuff like school, bills, etc. This last time, my ex was FURIOUS with me for talking about periods with the girls. She shouted at me that I was sick and perverted, why didn't I call her myself if I knew it was so urgent, I could've called one of their grandmas/aunts, but my mom has dementia, while her mom and sisters call me a loser because I teach kindergarten, so I'm not fond of them.My ex told me I was being immature and should have just toughed it out for the girls. This really pissed me off, so I shouted back that maybe if she wasn't such a deadbeat and answered her goddamned phone once in a while, she could have handled this. I brought up everything she does that hurts them; she hasn't been to a single soccer game, piano recital, or gymnastics meet in two years, every other weekend when they come home from her house, they go straight to their rooms, only to emerge hours later asking me why she loves her new husband more than them, and what did they do to make her leave. My ex responded by saying I should tell them it's not their fault I couldn't satisfy her, and I screamed ""fuck you"", and she just smirked and pointed behind me, saying ""Look what you did""When I turned around, my 8yo and 10yo were standing in the doorway crying. It broke my heart; I never shout, so I know I scared them. My 12yo stormed in and started screaming at her mom, and while I appreciate her sticking up for me, this is not a battle I want her fighting. My ex hung up before I could fully deescalate the situation, and let's just say the girls have been given free reign of the ice cream and limitless hours of video games, because I feel so bad. I even watched all the Twilight movies with them, so don't say I don't love them. But in this instance, AITA for shouting?"
23,Not the A-hole,AITA for saying my babysitting rates are $35 an hour?,40706,eizcvf,8956,"I'm a software engineer, with a full time job and a side hustle of doing freelance coding work in my own time. I've always been the type to have a side hustle I put a lot of my free time into; I get really bored sitting idle.My freelance hourly rates are $60 an hour, and at my full time job, my hourly pay works out to about $40 an hour. So that's how I value my time. Anyway, over Christmas vacation, I was staying at my parents house. My cousin was also staying over with her three young kids from Christmas to new year's.I'd been planning on doing some work on my freelance projects when I had free time; in the mornings when my family had no plans. I wasn't in any rush; I was already ahead of schedule on them all, but I didn't really have anything else to do. It was in a really rural area and it's like an hour drive to the nearest anythingThen my cousin and her husband asked if I could babysit all day for three days, so they could visit some friends in the area and hang out with just adults. I said I had planned on doing freelance work at the library, and she offered to pay me to babysit.I said I could if they got close to my freelance rates. She wanted a number, and although my freelance rates are $60 I didn't feel like that was right, it was high. But I didn't want to go too low; honestly babysitting 3 kids would be harder for me than the routine coding work I had for my freelance project. I don't know a lot about kids and I've never babysat for long, and I had a feeling it would be stressful and difficult.So I said $35, which is below what I make hourly at work, and what is the bare minimum I'd value my time for, if that time is spent doing difficult work. And she went crazy at me, saying that's a ridiculous rate for babysitting, that I was entitled and being selfish, that I'm trying to take advantage of how she didn't have other options, etc.I said that's way below what I'd be making if I had the time to do my own work, and I'd be putting off my own work to babysit. Her husband then got mad at me saying that I was a 24 year old girl, that I'm damn near a child myself, that my time is not worth that much and it's childish to say that it was. And that I was a stupid girl for not knowing that babysitting costs like 15 an hour, when I grew up and have kids of my own I will see how stupid I was being.I was kind of done with being called stupid so I just told them I hoped they could find someone else.My mom thinks that I asked for something offensive, and my cousin and her husband obviously did too.AITA for giving that number?"
24,Not the A-hole,AITA for making fun of a white girl for being poor because she was being racist?,39636,icmq68,2161,"I’m Asian, more specifically one of the only Chinese people in my grade, which has been absolutely fun these days. So the girl in question, has been racially harassing me since the beginning of lockdown, when she dmed and said “did the bat taste good? thanks a lot you fucking freak”. I reported her to my school, and they literally just dropped it because they said tensions were high, and she couldn’t be blamed because her uncle had corona, some BS like that. Then I got repeated messages like that from fake/newly created accounts, that I suspect were from her, and I just kept blocking them until I guess she gave up because I wasn’t reacting. My school district has chosen to do in person, massively dumb imo, but whatever. On the literal second day of school, she walks up to me while I’m in the lunch line and says in a thick asian accent, “Are you eating bat dumpring or dog noodle?” Other people around me fucking laughed, and I’m sure I don’t have to explain this, but I felt fucking humiliated. It finally felt like I got her off my back for a little while, and she comes back as soon as school starts, and I already know my school administration isn’t going to go to bat for me. I don’t know a lot about this girl, since obviously I try to avoid her, but I did know that she had shitty teeth, lived in a trailer, and was very poor. I’m ashamed to have stooped to this, but I just wanted to show her how I felt for once, so I said, “I’d be less concerned with what I’m eating if I were you, and more worried about your diet, since you’re the one who needs to figure out how to brush her teeth in a trailer with no running water. Stop trying to get sent to a hospital when you can’t afford healthcare.” Other students nearby told me I went too far because “it wasn’t her fault she was poor” LIKE IT WAS MY FAULT I WAS ASIAN?!?! She literally fucking cried, like I didn’t cry everytime she called me a fucking chink. She’s left me alone ever since though, which doesn’t matter since I plan on transferring anyways."

I am a 19 year old man and the people calling me an asshole are 18 year old men and women. On Thursday, a person I had a major crush on in high school (but who rejected me) messaged me out of the blue. She had never contacted me without my contacting her first, and at one point I realized she had had me blocked on social media, and so I found it odd that she was suddenly being friendly. After sending a couple of greetings/questions about how I've been, she said that she was going to have some people over and wanted to know if I would get the beer. The drinking age where we are is 19, and she and the people who were going to chill were all 18. The liquor stores in my area all card.I thought it was silly that my being a month older meant I could buy liquor and they couldn't, and so I said I would love to go. She said ""thanks, I'll pick you up at seven!""7 o'clock rolled around, and she texted me to say she was in front of my house. I went out dressed and ready to chill with some people, and she drove me to the liquor store. When we got there, I asked what beer she wanted me to get, and she told me to get Budweiser. I hid my disappointment as well as I could, but it was her party so I went in and bought two cases of 24. I got back in the car and said ""let's party,"" and she was eerily quiet. I noticed that she wasn't driving towards her neighborhood, but rather back towards mine. I thought she had moved or something, but didn't want to press the issue. When she turned down my street I finally figured it out. She was being purposefully vague about the invitation because she wanted me to get the beer, but she wanted a way out when she told me I wasn't actually invited in the first place.She stopped in front of my house, leaned over, kissed me on the cheek, and said ""thanks!"" in her best voice. I deadpanned her and asked when she was going to tell me I wasn't invited. She feigned surprise and said that she never intended to invite me in the first place. I sat in silence for a long awkward minute, picked up the beer, and walked towards my front door. She got out of her car and frantically tried to reinvite me to the party, but I told her that what she did was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. I opened my front door, slammed it a bit too hard, and came back to my room.Now I'm sitting here drinking absolutely unpalatable piss water, and I have text messages from all of her friends and her asking me why I'm being such a dick. I don't think I'm the asshole for reacting the way I did, but if you haven't figured it out I'm not amazing socially so I'm not sure. Am I here?"
26,Not the A-hole,AITA for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does?,39362,d38i34,2863,"Background: I graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. My sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. We both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. I pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.This is a throwaway and it's still fresh and I'm really emotionally charged right now. Last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. I overheard and I offered to help by paying more in rent (I was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. My parents were grateful. Now, prior to this, I never asked my how much sister pays in rent. I always figured my parents charged us the same. So absentmindedly I asked a follow-up question.Me: How much is [my sister] paying [for rent]?My Mom: Nothing.A long ass pause.Me: What do you mean she doesn't pay rent?My Dad (visibly angry): Your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!My dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. She doesn't pay rent. She doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. So for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while I've been paying my parents.So later that night we had a family sit down talk. My sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much I was paying. She offered $100. My parents suggested she pay $300, I pay $800 which my sister and I both rejected.The conversation ended with this:Sister: **FUCK YOU. I'M TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE.** [These were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)So my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. I'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. My mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.So I say my part before leaving.Me: I'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (It's only fair right?) And if I do pay rent, I pay whatever she's being.My mom: What if she pays $300 and you pay $800-Me: No.My mom: But [me], we really need the money...Me: That's too bad.I get up and go off to my room.So this morning my dad comes in tells me that I'M AN ASSHOLE FOR NOT PAYING RENT. That I should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. I'm like, ""what the hell? make [my sister] pay rent!""My mom, who's listening in.""You've seen her! She won't listen to us!""Me: WELL THAT'S TOO BAD.My mom (really angry): WELL WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM IF YOU DIDN'T TRY TO MAKE YOUR SISTER PAY RENT.That was the last straw that blew it for me. I slammed the door on my parents.As I'm typing this my parents are in the living room discussing how both their children are rotten and shit was better back in the home country/back in their day when kids listened to their parents. Like wtf?"
27,Not the A-hole,"AITA for ""making fun"" of a woman for being in her 40s and single?",39171,icvnba,2376,"This whole saga started because my husband took my last name. A couple weeks ago he got his workplace to change it, and his coworkers found out. About half of them think this is the funniest thing ever and about half are deeply offended. Brenda is in the offended half, and has made that clear. He and I are in a group chat with his coworkers where we organize carpooling during the pandemic. It is very helpful to us, so we can't leave the chat. Since he changed his name, my husband and I have been dealing with a lot of dumb jokes in the chat, which we have been mostly ignoring. Yesterday Brenda, his coworker and I got into a bit of a spat. I messaged the group asking if someone could take my husband home since I wouldn't be back from work until late and needed the car. One of his other coworkers agreed, and I thought that was that. Brenda messages the group saying ""maybe if you spent less time at work and more time being a wife, your husband wouldn't come into work with dirty shirts"" I took this as a bad joke initially. My husband is a rural mail carrier, so his shirts look like shirts worn by someone in 90 degree heat on dusty roads. I do wash them, but there's only so much to be done. Me: I could make cleaning those shirts my full-time job and it wouldn't do much lolBrenda: you won't be married very long if you keep trying to be the man in the relationship. I'd be embarrassed as a wife if I did so little for my husbandMe: well I work more hours and pay the bills, so I think he can oxyclean his own shirts if it's so importantBrenda: maybe you should learn to take proper care of your husband or you'll find yourself divorced. Me: I'll let you know when I need relationship advice from someone who is 42 and singleNow apparently Brenda is going around and saying that I ""mocked her for being single in her 40s"". I don't care if someone is single in their 40s, but I think it's absolute bullshit that she can call me a bad wife but I can't point out she has no frame of reference. AITA reddit?Edit: people keep asking why I need to help arrange rides in the first place. When my husband is out on deliveries he rarely has cell service, so if I find out late that I'm going to be home late I need to be able to reach his coworkers directly. Multiple spouses are in the chat for the same reasons.Edit 2: people are saying that I've hurt my husband's feelings by saying I pay the bills. After reading the exchange he sent me a text saying ""sometimes I forget you're a hard little bitch who takes no prisoners. I'm so proud lol."" He's fine, I asked him just now if my comment about the bills hurt him and he said ""oh yeah, it's so hard having a hot wife who makes good money. Really tough, pray for me."""
28,Not the A-hole,"UPDATE: AITA if I ""cancel"" Christmas because I can't afford it this year?",38936,e8w7e6,874," Previous Post: [\_if\_i\_cancel\_christmas\_because\_i\_cant\_afford/]( So, it's been 2 weeks and somehow the messages are still coming in.  Thankfully the offers of charity have stopped (here's hoping they were redirected to their communities) but a good deal of them asking whether or not I stopped being a grinch and started being a good husband and father again.  So, to get those people placated first, here you go:  I DECORATED.  Pics without our faces only, sorry.  []([]([](;I also spoke with a financial advisor, who is helping me set up a budget for 2020, and a counselor who helped me realize that I was worth more than the goods I could offer someone.  She recommended 2 separate therapists to me, and neither are taking new patients before the new year, so for now, my wife and I are working on our budget and cleaning out various corners of the house for things to sell.  So far, we've gotten rid of some unused basement furniture, a mini fridge that has been empty for 2 years, a bunch of wine racks and paraphernalia (we don't drink at home since the baby was born 2 years ago, so no need to keep it around) as well as some other things and made about $750, more than enough to pay all the overdue bills, put some money in savings, and groceries in the cupboard.  It's going to be a long road to pay off this cc debt, but we're finally addressing the issue head on and moving in the right direction.Since my last paycheck (that covered mortgage and utilities, no worries there, for those who asked if I was behind, thank you) I have also been offered (and taken) 3 DJ gigs for Holiday parties.  2 for personal friends/acquaintances businesses, 1 for a charity.  I refused payment for the children's charity gig, instead offering to give the money right back to the kids instead, which was gratefully accepted by the organizer.  The extra cash from the 2 paying gigs paid down some more debt, and was enough leftover to allow me to have bought some nice new books and a Moana doll for my little girl to open on Xmas morning, (to say nothing of the bags of presents from both sets of grandparents full of clothes and toys, so she'll be fine from a presents standpoint).Inspired by everyone's offers of charity, I volunteered again at Paul's Place in Baltimore, where this time I donned the hairnet and apron and served hot meals.  Cell phones are prohibited inside, plus taking photos of yourself doing charity work defeats the purpose of said work.  I also organized a food drive at my office to provide meal kits for Christmas for needy families, and we were able to donate 574 lbs of food to the MD Food Bank!Thank you to all who reached out and made me realize that I really was an asshole.  I let my personal shortcomings almost ruin a holiday for my wife and child.  It won't be as fancy as our last Christmases, but I have a feeling that this year will be very special to me, no matter how little is under my tree.  I realized that I have all the gifts I need, and I cannot thank the beautiful people who offered up so much charity to a grumpy stranger.  I didn't need to accept your gifts to accept your love, and the offers alone changed my life.&#x200B;Happy Holiday's y'all."
29,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling my family that if they gift us money for our wedding, there will be no ""strings attached"" or we will politely decline it?",38686,c8uwj2,3058,"I fucking hate wedding culture.It's bullshit.My fiance and I thought we would escape the bullshit and money by having a small thing. Well, family started trying to throw money at us to make it bigger and more spectacular. We were surprised, but it was a good surprise.Then the demands started coming out. They wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person HAS to be a groomsman, etc etc. Suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion.We put our foot down and said:>Thank you all for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. Unfortunately, it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. When we were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached. With so many requests and so many demands from people we didn't expect would think they had a say in *our* wedding, we have decided to give everyone their money back.   >  >Our understanding of what a gift is must be very different.  >  >If you would like to give us money without strings attached or requests or demands, we will gracefully accept it. But if you believe a gift should come with stipulations, we must regretfully, and politely decline.This has caused an epic shitstorm. Such to the point where I have people saying they will never come to our wedding (honestly, not the worse thing in the world), that we are spoiled, we're assholes, etc etc etc. My parents are rather upset about it, but hers (who never made any demands and gave us a small cash gift) said we did the right thing. We are halfway to canceling the whole party and just absconding into the wilderness to do the wedding the way we want. AITA? (Are We?)"
30,Not the A-hole,AITA because I refuse to go and visit my special needs stepsister in hospital even though she’s very sick? I low key hate her.,38508,d1btlg,4339,"I’m 15 years old. I have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. I’m not sure what’s wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she’s non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. She also doesn’t understand stuff. That’s probably the easiest way to put it. She’s just a human body with nothing inside. She’s my stepmoms daughter. My stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. I don’t know my stepmom very well and I don’t really get on with her. We are respectful to each other but I’m basically living with strangers because she’s so busy with her daughter and my dad. I am always on my own and I used to hate it but I’m used to it now.Ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. That’s fine, I get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that I don’t want to do and I resent doing. Stuff like staying home when I want to go to the mall with my friends, they’re disappointed that I don’t get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. My own mom passed away when I was small so I can’t go and stay anywhere else and all in all I’m just a lot more angry than I used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever I say I don’t want to do anything for her. Even stuff like feeding her- like- I don’t want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. I didn’t ask for this. Anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. She was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. I don’t want to go and visit her. I remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and I just hate hospitals and I sort of hate my stepsister and I just don’t want to go and visit someone who doesn’t even know I’m there. My stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. They haven’t yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because I don’t want to visit. My grandma who lives in Canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and I don’t need to force myself to go to the hospital so I’m assuming my dad has told her I’m refusing to go. He keeps pleading with me but I keep telling him I’m not doing it. I told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and I need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom. I just want to know what Reddit thinks because half my friends think I should go and the other half think I’m justified in saying no."
31,Not the A-hole,AITA For Barring My Husband From The Bedroom Tonight?,38418,hxm71l,2335,"So here is the situation.Me: nurse. Working 50ish hours a week in paediatric ICU. Cry at least once a week because that shit is hard. My salary pays our bills. All of them. Husband: 25M. Has a degree but isn't looking for a job. Works 2 days a week at the grocery store. Spends most of his time playing LoL. Btw all events here are in accordance with Covid Legislation. Today was supposed to be A Good Day. I had been begging my husband to swap his Saturday shift to literally anything else so that we could have days off together. We haven't had a weekend together since our wedding, 18mo ago. Today was supposed to be our first Saturday off together. We were going to go to an animal sanctuary.He starts the day by going to breakfast. With his best mate. Leaving before I even wake up. I wake up around 9 and realise he is not home. Call. He says he's helping his mate set up some lights and that the weather is too rainy for the animal sanctuary anyway. He gets home at 1ish. Lies around. Plays some video games, promising we would cook dinner together tonight.Leaves again at 5 to help the same mate with something else. I go grocery shopping. I don't drive because of medical issues, but I walk there and back in the rain. I get home, realise I've left my keys inside. Call husband, knowing he's 5min away. He says he will leave in a minute. I sit in the rain and the cold (southern hemisphere). 45 min later, I call again. He hasn't left yet. He finally agrees to come and let me in the house, so he drives up, presses the clicker to let me in the garage and leaves again. At 10, I I called to see where he is. His friend answers. Says he is driving out to do something an hour away. It's 10.30. I am going to bed. I have sent him a txt that I am upset and don't want to speak to him tonight and would rather he left me alone. As far as I am concerned, if he can't value me more than his best mate on the first day off he and I have shared in a year and a half, he can go sleep in his bed instead. (Btw, his friend doesn't work, so they hang out all the time when I am at work). He is going to be upset. And he is gonna tell his mate and his mate is going to tell him I'm being a bitch. AITAAdding some info: I am 26. We weren't always like this. I don't know what changed. I'm fairly confident he's not having an affair. And I fully intend on talking this through, but at a time that isn't 4am. Also the crying: sick babies sometimes make me sad, and I love all my patients. That's why I cry. And I don't mean hours of sobbing. I mean stepping into a supply closet to take a moment before getting back to work. Also thank you for your kindness. I was expecting maybe 5 replies. I am trying to respond as much as I can. But there are a lot of you."
32,Not the A-hole,AITA for not waking up my girlfriend for her exam after I overheard her calling me a little bitch?,38352,gth6bg,1669,"My girlfriend has online summer courses and she had an exam for one of them this morning. I usually wake her up for pretty much everything because she sleeps through her phone alarm no matter how long it buzzes or how many she sets. She has joked that I’m her butler before and within the context of a relationship it’s ok so I didn’t mind, obviously I want to love my partner and try make her life easy. However last night she was chatting with her friends and she thought I couldn’t hear. She was bragging that I’m her little bitch and I do everything for her when she tells me to, etc. It really hurt my feelings because they were making comments like ‘good, put him in his place’ and she was agreeing. She specifically said ‘yeah I’m not worried about tomorrow because the bitch will make sure I’m up and he’ll probably have breakfast ready for me too’ I went to bed pretty hurt by it, and come morning I didn’t bother to wake her up when her alarm started to go. She usually only gets up when someone physically shakes her, but I let her turn off her alarm and she slipped back into sleep and I turned around and went back to sleep too. When she woke up she was yelling at me saying I’m an asshole and I’ve cost her her exam and I’m a piece of shit for what I did.EDIT: sorry for not responding sooner I wrote this up on my break at work and now I have to get back to it (can’t have my phone, work with food) I wasn’t expecting this many replies so fast. I think we’re breaking up. I told her this morning after she called me a ‘bitch’ for being upset re being called a bitch, lol, but she says she’s not done with me. I’m just trying to get through today’s shift and then deal with stuff later. I’ll try and get back as I can. We’ve been together a year and it was my first real relationship but I’m tired of her not acknowledging how shitty she made me feel and still calling me a bitch. That word is really making me feel shit and small."
33,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my wife’s friend she is too old and ugly after she repeatedly asked my 19-year-old son to take off his shirt? He was getting uncomfortable.,38061,hzjbhx,1332,"My family had a small get together at my house. One of my wife’s friends was over (she is unmarried I think she is 45-47)? We aren’t too close to her since she lives pretty far away. She was over our house and she started complimenting my son (my son is 19). It starts off innocent but as time goes on it gets more and more crossing the line. When we were out on my deck she starts telling my son to take his shirt off, 'whats the point of going to the gym if no one will see it.' My son is visibly uncomfortable and tries to shut her down. She repeatedly is asking and is getting more aggressive with it. I interject and I am like ""Hey Kathy, I think you are a bit too old and ugly for my son."" This got her upset really quickly, and she excuses herself to the bathroom and starts crying. My wife goes to comfort her, and then later she leaves. At the end of it my wife is super angry with me for saying that, that I should have said hey Cathy looks like you had too much to drink or something else. I told my wife, that Kathy (btw this is not her real name) works a corporate job she has had training on this and that she knows better. And our son was uncomfortable. He is 18+ but he doesn't know how to deal with an adult-adult let alone someone saying that in our house. I told my wife flat out that if I was to invite a guy friend and he was to ask to see our daughter in a bikini my wife would have called the police. She says its different. I tell her that I was way kinder to Kathy than I would have been had a guy said something like that to our daughter. And I told my wife that Kathy needs to apologize to my son before she can ever come into our house again. Overall, I think I was fair. If Kathy just said it once and I said that I think I would be the asshole, but the fact she kept repeating it that's why I said it. And I wanted her to get the message that yes I am upset that's why I included the ugly part."
34,Not the A-hole,AITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?,37928,avtmig,268,"This issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.I am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like ""Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19."" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.But there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.I was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.It all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.She had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's"", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.I was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.She is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.Edit: I am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. Each comment means the world to me. I am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. No one besides my family has said these things to me. I know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. From the bottom of my heart,thank you.Edit 2: Honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. I promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. Thank you for the gold.Thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. I honestly have gone through as many as I can and I just feel really fortunate and grateful.I sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. Thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.Edit 3: I am sorry for boring you with all these edits. I geniunely can't thank you guys enough. I showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. I am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.BUT, I have been noticing a worrying number of DMs saying me I could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.I am not this kind of person and I hope nobody is. I have my own integrity. It's NOT right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. A couple of other DMs sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. It's honestly horrifying. I am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. I just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. I thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. A lot of women ARE amazing. My mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and I am sure many women out there are amazing.  Please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. Because I am not going to do that, ever. Please don't say all women are manipulative etc. This post isn't anti-women in anyway, it's me talking about the person I believe wronged me."
35,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking my cousin off of my sister’s wedding Zoom call?,37270,hx80wd,1418,"My [27M] older sister [30F] and her fiancé [31M] were planning for over a year for their wedding to be this month. Obviously, they can’t have the wedding as planned, but they still would like to get married, so they decided on a “Zoom” wedding where all of the family/friends would just call in to watch the officiant, my sister, and her fiancé. My sister didn’t want to be in charge of hosting the Zoom call because she thought it would stress her out, so she asked me to and I gladly accepted. She and her fiancé decided to invite everyone they originally wanted to, and it was a very big list. When we were going over the list, my sister mentioned to me that she wanted everyone else to be muted for the majority of the wedding as she was worried that others would talk over her and her fiancé and quote “overshadow” them on their big day “that was already scaled down”. However, her and her fiancé said that I should unmute everyone at one point so everyone could talk and have a nice time with each other. Fast-forward to the day of the wedding—everyone is muted during the ceremony which goes great, and so I then unmute everyone and ask to please raise a hand if they’d like to talk so it doesn’t get confusing. My cousin (around my age) starts waving his hand crazily, and he’s with his longtime girlfriend (also similar age I guess). He’s a very gregarious guy, so I was not surprised. Then, he says stuff like “(my sister) and (her husband) are such an inspiration, it’s given me the courage to do this....” then turns to his girlfriend and pulls out a box that is the size of an engagement ring box??I immediately saw this as him trying to steal the spotlight (something that he’s done since we were kids, ex: he would secretly mess up my sister and I’s drawings if the adults would praise ours) and booted him off of the call. Then I quickly announced that my cousin had technical difficulties and would not be joining again. Everyone else accepted this and went about talking, and my sister and her husband did too. The rest of the wedding went smoothly—except for the fact that my cousin kept texting me angrily saying that he finally wanted to propose as a surprise with family all around and I ruined it. My aunt and uncle texted me the same. AITA??"
36,Not the A-hole,AITA for yelling at my parents that their polyamory fucked up my childhood?,37152,ihp8sc,2679,"EDIT: to all of you who DMed me to tell me about how fucking great polyamory is and that you're mad I gave it a bad name, you have issues if that's what you take away from this postI believe it started when I was around 6 years old. My parents often had 'friends' over in the house. I didn't know they were polyamorous ofc. One day I was outside playing, got hurt and when I ran inside caught my parents  making out with some random guy. They told me they have other adults that they love and it's a completely normal thing. Me being a child just accepted that.They gave up being secretive and their 'partners' would constantly be around, even joining on outings. I remember that on my 10th birthday they invited 3 of their partners, one of who I'd never seen before, and for the rest of the day my parents just withdrew from my party and hung out with them. I never saw them doing anything explicit again but they would kiss their partners, hug them make flirty comments, something that would be normal between parents but with many more people. Sometimes I came home from school and my parents were gone and there was some random adult in our house, some of them seemed surprised that my parents even had a child. I always hated it, but since my parents had told me this was normal, I assumed many adults probably did similar things and that it's just an adult thing all kids hate. Later they had less partners and eventually seemed to stop. Not that I'd know for sure bc I moved out with 17. I didn't think about it anymore. A year ago I started therapy (other reasons). As usual the topic of my upbringing came up and it brought back many feelings I wasn't aware of. I realised that although my parents were always good to me, I had never really felt close to any of them and still have a lot of resentment that they made me feel like I had to compete for my parent's attention with random strangers. A while ago, I visited them and they told me they are going to take part in a documentary about polyamorous families and that the producers would like to include interviews with the children, so they would love if I could agree and tell everyone that polyamory 'doesn't mess kids up'. All my resentment bubbled up and I said that I cannot agree because I would not be able to say anything positive. My parents looked shocked (I had never brought this up before) and asked why, and I unloaded all, that I always felt pushed aside, we barely had any family time without strangers intruding, it turned into an argument and I became loud and yelled that the truth is it did fuck me up and they shouldn't have had a child if their number one priority was fucking the whole world. My mother cried and my father said I should probably leave. So I left and was shaken up for the rest of the week but also felt regret because I've never made my mum cry before. Later my father sent me a message that was like 'we are sorry you feel that way, can we have a calm discussion about this soon'. Even though I tried to, it's like I can't reply, this argument brought something very emotional up in me.AITA for hurting my parents over this, especially since I have never brought it up before?"
37,Not the A-hole,"AITA For calling my co-worker ""chunky"" after she repeatedly calls me ""slim"" and makes references to my weight after I asked her multiple times not to.",37095,bpe2di,1870,"I have a female co-worker who repeatedly calls me out regarding my weight. I'm female 5'9"" 115lbs and very thin. She is very overweight. All the time she makes comments about my weight. She doesn't call me by name she calls me ""slim"" and I even heard her say one time ""go ask toothpick"" and she has said stuff like ""you need some meat on your bones"" & ""you need to eat"". I have only worked there 8 days. I have asked her very nicely to stop. Yesterday I asked her to stop calling me slim again and she basically said it's her mouth and she can say what she wants. Today when she said ""morning slim"" I replied ""morning chunky"" and she got upset and actually started crying. Everybody here at work, (only 6 of us total) is saying I'm wrong and I should apologize because being called fat is ""different"" than being called skinny because being called skinny is a ""compliment"". I said as long as she calls me slim, I will call her chunky and now I'm the bad person. AITA if I don't apologize? The owner/manager has completely ignored the situation saying it's ""a high school issue and we should figure it out"".EDIT FOR MORE INFO: We don't have HR. There's only 6 of us working here (cupcake shop). We are all regular employees. I went to the owner BEFORE I called her chunky and I asked him to talk to her because I felt she was harassing me. That's when he said we can handle it ourselves. That's why I called her chunky. I told her to stop calling me slim and I didn't like it and she continued to do it. She didn't stop doing it after I asked multiple times and I didn't know what to do besides what she was doing to me. She brought up my weight, I brought up her's."
38,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my wife and in-laws to fuck off after they told me to stop cuddling my daughter?,37089,ctwk69,2638,"I have 3 kids, 15F, 12F and 7M. My oldest has always been a cuddler, and that suits me fine because I am too. Recently my in laws were over, and we were all watching a movie together. It was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep.After the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. There was a fair bit of wine involved (I was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my FIL let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate I still cuddled with my 15yo. I don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but I was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. To my surprise, my wife and MIL both agreed with him.I have a lot of respect for my in-laws, I get along with them great and I consider them closer than my own parents. Obviously I'm quite fond of my wife as well, but I outright told them to ""fuck off and go fuck themselves"" and then left them and went to bed. I've never spoken to any of them like that before, but it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. They all want me to apologize for being so rude to them. AITA?&#x200B;Edit due to info request: We were not spooning, she was sitting next to me laying on my chest.Edit of my own free will: Idk if it's important info, but I didn't yell.Edit: I think I've read most everything now, thanks for all the messages of support and hate, I liked them all. Some people asked me to make an update post, I don't think I will, sorry. I've been speaking to them over the past few days and I know why they said what they said (although it's not relevant to me telling them to fuck off), but it's pretty personal and I don't feel like sharing. I wont be apologizing to any of them, especially now that I know their reasoning. I love my wife, but it hurts that she doesn't trust me."
39,Not the A-hole,AITA For Not Baking Much For My Family,36807,gcr7vr,1722,"I [16M] started dating my girlfriend 2 years ago. I also got super super into baking around that time. I bake a lot. My girlfriend loves desserts. So I've given her a ton of stuff I bake, all kinds of different stuff. I often try to bake something new and then she gets to try something new. I honestly love baking way more than eating it. My girlfriend is the opposite.Well recently she gave me a scrapbook she made. She had counted every thing I baked her apparently, and she gave me this scrapbook after I baked her, her 100th dessert. It was filled with a picture of every dessert I've baked and pictures of me baking  and her eating. She wrote a paragraph about each item I baked. Each item was dated too. She had been working on this for 2 years. She also wrote a long letter on how proud she is of my baking hobby, thanking me for the sweets, and telling me how much she loves me. It was the sweetest gift I've ever gotten and I honestly cried.I showed my mom and sister expecting them to think its cute but they were pissed. They were angry I've spent so much time baking for my girlfriend and not them. I just got into this habit and I loved making my girlfriend happy as well since she loves desserts."
40,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving significant facial scarring uncovered on a plane and being confrontational when a father asked me to cover it because it was scaring his son?,36654,f3asns,2800,"I sustained very bad injuries to my face this month. I'm in the stage of healing when the scar tissue has formed, but it's still very tender ""new skin"". I'm going to have very obvious facial scarring for the rest of my life. The injury starts about an inch above my hairline, goes down over my brow so that on part, hair will not grow. It continues down my cheek where it is deepest; I'll always probably have an indentation in the fullest part of my cheek. Then it continues to my jawline. In some ways it's OK. I'm happy it's just cosmetic damage. My friends are super reassuring, telling me how badass and sick it's gonna look. They say I'm still as hot as ever, now a little more sexy and mysterious lol.But in some ways it really sucks... I know that I'm always gonna be seen first as ""the girl with the scar"" and it feels especially bad when people look at me differently.This week, I had to fly home for a family thing; it was a plan I'd made long before my injury. I wasn't really looking forward to the pity or people making a big deal of it; I'd rather it not be acknowledged.I'd also met with my dermatologist who said that I was at the stage of scar tissue formation that I no longer should be dressing the wounds; the skin was healing and instead I needed to be applying topical cream and Vaseline to keep the site clean and moist. It also looks a bit ugly; the building scar tissue is very red and tender, and with the Vaseline over it, looks slick and shiny.So I get on this flight; I have the window seat and I put on my headphones and drift off to sleep when the plane is still boarding.I wake up to this kid, maybe 4 years old, sat next to me, throwing a tantrum. I didn't catch the first part of it and I honestly couldn't understand what he was yelling about... His father said to me, ""Can you cover that injury?"" I said that my dermatologist recommends I don't, so no I don't think I will. He started snapping at me saying ""there is no need to be so rude. That injury is graphic and it's scaring my little one.""I said ""this is my face. The only damn face I've got. It sucks being told I'm so ugly I can't show my goddamn face in public.""He started to backtrack saying ""just until it's healed"" and I said ""it'll always be with me. Maybe teach some fucking compassion and respect instead of telling a girl half your damn age what you think about her face. That's rude. He actually got up after that and I think went to a stewardess about a seat change because a young couple came to sit next to me on a few minutes instead. I've gotta admit I felt so low that I put on my sunglasses and had a quiet cry for a few minutes.AITA for not covering my healing scar, and for being confrontational about it?"
41,Not the A-hole,AITA for throwing my sister out of my house after she billed me?,36476,iiqfnz,1471,"My sister is a trainwreck. She needed a place to stay and I have a large enough home for an extra person. She has no job or income. I told her she has a few months to get her shit together and leave. I give her about $100 a week to keep my house clean so she has some cash.I gave my sister her $100 and she said I owed her more. I was confused. She said she did other ""work"" for me. I asked her what more did she do? She said she walks my dog in the afternoon. I walk my dog every morning and evening. But she takes him with her on her afternoon walks. She said the going rate for a dogwalker is $25 per walk. 5 X $25 = $125 on top of the $100.Then she mentions she put together a scrapbook of personal letters and papers. According to her and Etsy, that job was easily another $75. I told her I never gave her permission to do those things. Her argument is that those jobs fell under the umbrella of keeping the house clean and I was ripping her off.So I threw her out. The money isn't the issue. I have plenty of disposable income. I was disgusted how she came at me."

His name was John. I liked her grandfather, and I know he and my wife were very close, but I won't even consider it, not even for our son's middle name. I feel that's just setting him up a world of problems, especially when he grows up and has to apply for jobs. Nobody's going to believe ""John Doe"" is his real name. My wife thinks I'm being an asshole for vetoing a name with a strong family connection and says I'm exaggerating the issues he would face. AITA?"
43,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my wife it’s not ‘cute’ for her to encourage our teenage daughter to expect her boyfriend to pay for EVERYTHING in their relationship?,36325,gnkxa5,2235,"Wife and I have been married 18 years, we have our 16 year old daughter who has been dating a slightly shy/ awkward young man for around 3-4 months now. He seems very nervous around my daughter and has admitted in a passing comment here and there to my wife and I that he can’t believe she agreed to date him and he thinks she’s way out of his league. He seems very respectful, just shy.  My wife is usually an independent, awesome woman and her ideals align closely with mine particularly in term of feminism and equality. We have both striven to raise our daughter to be as independent and capable as possible. Since my daughter has been dating this kid my wife has changed considerably and has given our daughter advice that has left me with raised brows more than once. Some of the advice I’ve heard my wife give is ‘oh it’s cute for boys to pay for everything, especially in your first relationship!’ Or ‘oh honey don’t worry about that, he can pay for you, if he really liked you he would’ and similar. I’ve tried to balance this out by telling my daughter straight away ‘two people in a partnership should be contributing equally’ and my personal favorite ‘if someone asks if they can *take you out* to dinner, it’s reasonable to expect them to pay, but if someone asks you to grab dinner with them, it’s reasonable to split the payment’. I figured that would be an easy way for a young person to understand the difference. However I’ve noticed my daughter becoming more and more entitled with her boyfriends money. They haven’t been anywhere obviously since we’re home but the way she talks about him ‘oh I’ll just ask him to pay for x’ etc leaves a bad taste in my mouth. She has also flippantly bragged/ mentioned that she gets him to buy gift cards for her etc by mentioning her mother’s advice, i.e. ‘if you really liked me you’d pay for x’ I spoke to my wife privately and told her my concerns, she insists it’s a rite of passage for girls and it’s cute that she should feel a guy is completely spoiling her. I told her that it’s not cute for her to be thinking it’s acceptable to view relationships as personal ATMS, and my wife became very angry with me and is now calling me an asshole with a lot of hostility."
44,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to pay back my cousin after my baby ruined her blouse?,36220,cw43oc,8873,"Hi all. I gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter Charlotte. My cousin Alice and her parents were among the guests. The first thing I'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. She's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. She doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. She is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. It was Alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly Charlotte vomited on her. Alice handed Charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. I went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.Today I got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly £1800) since it was completely ruined. I have said no. At the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. She took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. I feel bad for her but it was not my fault. Am I doing the right thing by refusing to pay up?"
45,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my parents they only have one daughter and she is six feet in the ground.,36051,kvjl5f,2408,"This all started when I was 12 years old and my younger sister was ten. Let's call her Abby. Well, Abby started to get sick and no one in the family knew what was going on. I started to be dropped off at my grandparents as they went to different doctors. I'm not going to go into her illness but when the doctors figured it out it was bad. So a lot of time was devoted to my sister. When I was 14 it got worse and I started to be left at my grandparents for longer amounts of time. It started with just staying the weekend and then maybe the whole week. I would bring it up and they told me that they have to focus on Abby. Soon I was staying there for months. By the time I was 16 I was basically living there full time. I would maybe see them every other month. If it texted them about the whole thing the same response was always sent, We need to focus on Abby right now.I'm 19 now and Abby has passed away from her illness. Her funeral was two weeks ago and I attended through facetime. I got a call today from my parents and they wanted to met up and be a family again. I told them that they abandoned one child for another. I am not their child anymore. That they only have one daughter and she is six feet under the ground now. I soon hung upI've been getting texts calling me an ass and that I should understand that they needed to focus on ABBy and to suck it up basically. So AITA"
46,Not the A-hole,AITA for admitting I regret having children.,36011,e7t57k,5227,"My wife and I are both 42 and in marriage counselling after our marriage basically went to shit after having kids (6 and 4 year old twins). A lot of issues and disagreements have come up in our marriage that have driven us apart and I have been working through my resentment that going back for one more baby resulted in twins, including one which we are pretty sure has ADHD and ODD and is a *nightmare* child). Our counsellor asked me if I would have children if I had to do it all over again and I said ""honestly, no"". I love my kids and would take a bullet for them, but if I had the chance to go back to 24 when I finished grad school and could do my life over again, I wouldn't choose fatherhood. It is not the fulfilling experience everyone claims and while I love my children, the sacrifices are not worth it to me. I had a much happier life before having children and have gone from someone who loved life to someone who just.....makes it through the day, working a job he hates to provide for the wife and kids while silently wishing this wasn't my life. My wife is *furious* and taking it the wrong way and even told our 6 year old ""daddy wishes you were never born"" which makes me livid. You don't tell the kid that.Yes, I wish I never had kids, but I do love them, would never hurt them or want to upset them. And I didn't say it to/in front of my kids and I never ever will. I said it in marriage counselling, what should be a safe space to talk about feelings. It has become a huge fight, our marriage is not going to be saved now, and I know she will try and use this against my in divorce court to try and get sole custody and take everything and lie to the kids who I do love and still want to be a Dad to them. She is incapable of understanding that you can love your kids but also feel that parenthood was the best choice for you.  AITA for saying it though?Edit: Ok this blew the fuck up and there is no way I can reply to everyone's questions. But to address a couple I have 3 kids not 4. One child is 6, two are four. English is not my first language and I forgot the comma, and even so that sentence would have been much clearer in my native language. When I say I resent having twins, I am not saying it is my wife's fault! But 3 children is more than we budgeted/bargained for and I need to pick up a lot overtime I that I would not have had to pick up if we just had 2 kids, and that is what I resent (that and the child with ADHD/ODD). My life is basically work and dealing with my kids. And do you know what ODD is? This child always refuses to do what is asked, gets angry and throws a tantrum when asked to do something he doesn't want to do, hits and kicks others, deliberately annoys and hurts others, is extremely spiteful, screams and kicks me constantly. ALWAYS. All day. Every day. It's exhausting and it is hell. Yeah. I would't have him again. Most people wouldn't if they had to raise him.  Just because I wouldn't do this over again doesn't mean I'm not committed to being a good dad and being present in their lives. I just would not do it over again if I could redo my adult life. My first kid was not born at 24, I just said that because if I could do my whole post-University life differently, I would change some other things too (mainly career) and to be honest, after all this, I regret marrying my wife, which is why I said it that way.Regarding calling the ADHD/ODD twin a nightmare, go google what that means. It is very difficult to manage and he has even been kicked out of three daycare places because they could not handle him and my parents even refuse to babysit him. We never get a break from home and no one can handle time."
47,Not the A-hole,AITA for suggesting/letting my 17 year old son get drunk?,35576,e9bilu,4766,"I (46M) live with my wife and my 17 year old son. My wife has been on a different continent for about a month taking care of her dying mother, so it has just been me and my son for that time.My son and I have a very close relationship where he tells me almost everything going on in his life. On Saturday, he told me that he was going to his first ever high school party this upcoming weekend. He was a bit nervous since he had never really drank before, but he knew that he was going to on that occasion. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but this is in Canada where the drinking age is 19 (in my province), and teenage drinking is very common.I asked my son if he wanted to have a few beers with me while we watched a sports game that night, as a ""test run"" of sorts. My logic was that if he goes into the party with zero awareness of his tolerance then it could end badly, and it would be best for him to find out his limit in the safety of his home with me.We had some beers over a few hours in the night, and I cut him off at 6 (he has had beer in the past, but never more than one at a time). He was pretty drunk but he was okay, and slept it off. We talked about it the next day, and we agreed that six was a bit much for him, and now he knows to have fewer than that at the party.I was actually pretty content with this whole situation, since he had his ""first experience"" drinking in a safe environment, and I feel much more comfortable with him going to a party now. However, in an effort to be transparent I told my wife about it the other day over the phone, and she was livid. She thinks it was reckless and irresponsible.AITA?INFO: I understandably am getting flack for not telling my wife beforehand, but I figured she had enough going on and I didn't need to bother her with something that seemed pretty trivial at the timeEDIT: Thanks for all the comments, I am reading every single one! I appreciate the different perspectives"
48,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling this college guy's mom that her coming into his interview cost him the job?,35461,hukoub,1820,"I am a hiring manager at a tech company and I was hiring for summer internships a little while ago.We had a guy, about 19 years old, applying for a summer internship between his freshman and sophomore years of college. It was a virtual interview over Zoom because of covid. A minute or two in, when I was introducing myself, his mom came in and introduced herself and started talking about her son's work ethic. I thought it was a little strange. I said something polite about wanting to hear from him.She just didn't get the hint and kept coming into camera frame during the interview and interrupting her son to answer questions for him. I asked a few technical questions which he seemed to answer well and then cut the interview fairly short.I thought that was all over and done with until I'd gotten an email from a woman, a month later, asking about her son's application, she seemed offended he hadn't gotten an acceptance or rejection. It bothered me, I felt bad for the kid honestly. Wayyy back when I was a teenager, my mom used to pull the same shit, but luckily she only did that when I was 15 and working for a day-camp, not when I was an adult applying for engineering jobs. But I felt like this poor kid was getting his chances ruined because his mom wasn't giving him the chance to apply on his own.I sent an email back saying I was not at liberty to send information about an application to anybody but the applicant. I also asked HR to send an email to the kid saying sorry but we were not making him an offer. (It is something we usually do, but his rejection email must have slipped through the cracks with all the Covid craziness.)Anyway, after we sent that, I got a phone call from his mom, she had a forwarded copy of the email, and she was demanding answers.I said that I could not comment on the guy's performance in the interview to her as she was not the applicant. If he wanted to reach out to me I was happy to give him some feedback. However, I could say that regardless of his performance, her presence in the interview took him out of consideration for the position. We were looking for an independent and self-driven person for the position, and for that reason, it is important to see an applicant speak for themselves, follow-up themselves, etc.I also said that, as a piece of advice, every hiring manager I've met in my career who sees someone other than the applicant answering questions during an interview, following up on the applicant's behalf, etc... Would also put their resume in the ""do not hire"" pile. Since, while the applicant may be skilled and motivated, they need the ability to demonstrate those traits themselves. She fucking blew up at me over that, kinda cussing me out to the point where I hung up.AITA for how I handled this? Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut way earlier"
49,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my husband to turn down his dream job for my career?,35319,ii4zpu,5901,"I’m going to be vague for privacy reasons, sorry.  I (33F) am the breadwinner of our household. I have multiple, highly specialized degrees for a niche industry. I make 200k+, with potential to get in the 600-M’s range. My company has not been hit that badly by COVID, so most of us have kept our jobs, but we’re held to strict standards.  My husband (36M) has a broad degree/work experience. He quit his job right before COVID hit, hoping for a better job in the meantime, and I was supportive. He spent a ton of time applying to various jobs, and finally landed an interview at Organization X. This is his dream job, in almost every imaginable way (I can’t be detailed). However, it’s paying about 65k a year, which would be fine except this job directly puts my job stability at risk. My company and this org. are adversarial, at best. My field is extremely secretive, and if clients discovered my spouse was working for a competitor, I would be permanently tainted. I wouldn’t be able to get a job in the industry forever. I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I promise you, it absolutely is not.It’d be like if I worked in protecting the privacy of celebrities, and he worked for TMZ. If he tapped my car, got into my work devices, he could use that to advance his career, and any trust I have in this field will be gone. Even if I trusted my husband not to do that, my clients and company don’t. Worse, b/c my background is so specialized, this is the only field I can work in. I asked him to drop from consideration for this job, since if he got it, we’d lose my income. 65k a year cannot support us in this city. Plus, he does not have to work for this organization. Even if the job market is awful right now, his background gives him access to a wide range of jobs, but I only have this one, niche field. He was extremely angry, and said I was “selfish and only cared about money.” I told him that if he wanted to go back to school for an advanced degree or just be unemployed for a while, I would support him, but taking this job isn’t possible. He continued the process behind my back, and got the offer. He wants to accept it, b/c he says his career needs to take priority and that I wasn’t being a supportive wife. I feel so betrayed, and I’ve contacted all relevant higher ups in my company to inform them. I notified them as soon as he got the interview, b/c it’s better coming from my email than from a background check. I told him he could decline the offer, w/me watching him physically decline it, or he could accept the offer and move out immediately. I would pay for him to stay two weeks at a hotel, and we would begin divorce proceedings. My company is willing to take care of all of my legal fees. I feel fucking awful. I still love him. I moved decisively, b/c this was the best way to cut my losses, but it still hurts. He called me heartless and cold. It’s true that I was prioritizing my career over his, but it felt like the only option at the time."

I finally told him ""You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""​His response was ""Sure thing, Jackie boy.""​Since I don't work directly with him, I figured ""screw it"" and that I'd ignore him.​Recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. I work late some nights, and Ted came to me and says ""Hey, Jack, I'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when I get back. See you there for a lift back to the office!""​(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)​As promised, I ignored him.​7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and I get a call. I recognize his number, so I ignored it. He called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.The first one was along the lines of ""Jack I'm at Enterprise. Come pick me up.""E-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as Jack, Jack-o, Jackie, and Jackie-boy. The emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.​I signed out and went home. It was raining hard.Next morning, I saw that Ted had sent a few more e-mails. I printed them off. At 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""Where the [f-bomb] were you? I told you when to pick me up! I HAD TO TAKE A CAB! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST ME?!"" He goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.​Supervisor: ""Ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. He was caught out in the rain.""​I relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. I'd highlighted the threats.Supervisor: ""I can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. But it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. That's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""With the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. Just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.""​A few people at the office have commented that I'm the jerk for ignoring Ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired.​*AM* I the a-hole on this?"
52,Not the A-hole,AITA for ruining game night by telling the truth?,34568,i34mdp,1841,"A few nights ago, I hosted a game night for a small group of friends (we had all been quarantining and following the proper guidelines in my county). It was only going to be 5 of us (including me), but one of my friends texted me last minute that she was going to bring a coworker from work (Matt-fake name). Fine with me.We started playing a card game where you answer questions about yourself; based on the level (Level 1, 2, 3), the question could be extremely surface level (ex. what's your favorite color?) to something deeper (ex. what characteristic of yourself do you not like about yourself?). Everyone was enjoying themselves, and I was happy with the way things were going.Cue a question I drew: ""What's the hardest thing you've ever had to go through?""Some backstory: My sister passed away a few years ago when I was still in high school. I was pulled out of class and flew immediately to her college and watched her die in the ICU. Needless to say, this is probably the hardest thing I've been through. 3 of my friends in the group knew about this, the other 2 and Matt did not.I didn't want to bring the mood down, so I answered that the hardest thing I'd been through was transitioning going to a college in a different state where I knew no one. We were all ready to move on, but Matt immediately piped up and said, ""Wow, if that's the hardest thing you've ever been through, you live an extremely privileged life."" Everyone got quiet. Now, if he had said it jokingly, I probably would have let it go and moved on. However, the way he said it was in a very condescending and patronizing tone, and I will admit, it rubbed me the wrong way. Instead of letting it go, I said ""well, the hardest thing I've ever been through is seeing my sister die in the ICU and having to watch her being lowered into her grave when I was 17. I just didn't want to bring the mood down.""If things were quiet before, they were dead silent now. Matt mumbled an apology but game night ended shortly after. After my friends all left, my friend who had brought Matt texted me and told me I was a jerk for making Matt look bad, and I could have just let his statement go. I do feel bad about what I said and being the cause of game night ending so soon, but I also feel like I was just making a justified statement. AITA?"
53,Not the A-hole,AITA for going to the police over a 'prank',34149,devz7y,6034,"Throwaway for anonymity sake incase this does go further. To preface this, I (24F) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. I have not eaten meat since I was roughly 3-4 years old when I found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). This is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so I thought. Four nights ago, I was at a party and I will admit, I got white girl wasted. My friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. I checked with them before chowing down ""are these vegan?"" To which my friends replied ""yeah, they're sunfed"" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). They tasted off to me but I figured it was just because I was drunk. I was wrong. I found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends Snapchat story. The story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where I asked if it was vegan). The and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when I found out I ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling ""the CHICKENS!!!""). I took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges. They all think that I'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so Reddit, AITA? In my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. In their view, it was just a prank."
54,Not the A-hole,AITA for blowing up at my stepsister at her comments about my lost weight?,34053,efz1kb,1930,"My stepsister (20F) and I (24M) have never gotten along. Her mom and my dad got married when we were six and ten so we've known each other for a long time. In my stepmom's eyes, she could do no wrong and anything bad that happened was pinned on me. My dad is a complete pushover so he would always fall over to whatever my stepmom would say.When I was about 15, I started gaining weight. My gf broke up with me (woohoo high school romance), I started failing some of my classes, and I quit baseball. I started to stress-eat and ballooned up from 125 pounds to 162. I guess at that point she decided she was ""cooler"" than I was and started mocking me and making fun of me, calling me names like ""fatass"" and ""chubster"". I would constantly go to my stepmom about it and she would tell me she's just teasing, she's so much younger, why are you getting upset? I got pissed off to the point where I just started avoiding her and locking myself upstairs in my room with a bag of chips. At 22 I hit 270 pounds and I knew I had gone too far. I was way past my weight limit and bordering on obese. So as a New Year's resolution, I decided to start losing weight. I cut out all junk food and started hitting the gym. Around this time my stepsister started to overeat too, I don't really know why but she gained over 30 pounds. She still was constantly belittling me about my weight (which admittedly, was way over hers).By the end of this year, I lost 120 lbs. It felt amazing. My stepsister now weighed more than me. Over Christmas dinner, all the aunts and uncles and cousins were complimenting me on my weight loss, telling me how I looked so much better. My stepsister just sat there smoldering. Every time someone said something she'd add, ""He's still pretty big"", ""Well he didn't get rid of that face roundness"", ""Maybe lose a little more around that gut"". It was infuriating and I was getting angrier.Now here's where I might be TA. Finally, at her last little snide, ""Look, you know you'll just put it all back on. Why do you even bother?"" I flipped out. I yelled, ""Why can't you just be happy for me, instead of getting on me for every little thing?""She said back to me, ""Defensive much?""  ""Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your 200-pound feelings?"" I asked her. I probably should have stopped there but I kept going. ""Calling me a fatass. Look at your plate! You've eaten half the table, fatty!"" She started crying and left the table. My stepmom screamed at me, saying just because I was insecure I can't take it out on everyone. I said, ""Oh, so *now* you're talking. Not in the past ten years of constant 'fatty' and 'lardass' and 'porker'!""  ""But you're way older!"" she whined.I left the table too and went home. I woke up today to a thousand messages from my stepmom, my dad, and my stepsister. They were saying I wasn't welcome to their house until I apologized. I'm not going to.AITA?EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for your comments and the awards. I've never felt better about myself than now. And yes, I understand that 270 lbs was not ""bordering"" on obese. I'm 6'0 so I was pretty damn obese. I called myself bordering for a few years after getting fat, it made me feel better than classifying myself as morbidly obese."
55,Not the A-hole,AITA for I telling my childhood bully (who is MtF transgender) that she will always be the “boy who bullied me”?,33979,dcb1vq,2756,"When I was a in middle school, I was viciously bullied by this boy, who I’ll call Z. He spread rumours about me, called me stupid and useless every chance he got, and made school a living hell. It’s been 12 years, and Z has since come out as MtF transgender. She messaged me over social media and asked to meet up. We went out for coffee, where she apologised for bullying me. It was along the lines of, “I’m sorry for being mean. I was young, and I was struggling with my gender identity.”I thanked her for her apology. When she asked if she was forgiven, and I tried to avoid answering. I am still not over what she did to me. What Z did to me impacted me greatly, as I was a impressionable young girl. I struggled with self esteem for years afterwards. Z started getting defensive. She told me that I was being petty and that I should forgive her. I told her, “Why? You will always be the boy that bullied me.  An apology won’t change that.” She got really offended when I said the word boy, and said that I was misgendering her. She called me a petty, transphobic, vindictive, and ignorant, then stormed out. AITA?"
56,Not the A-hole,AITA for outing my ex as gay after she told everyone that I cheated on her?,33908,dwrlls,4125,"I know the title sounds absolutely terrible.  My ex and I were together for 5 years. I decided to propose, but she rejected me. The next day, we had a talk. She realized that she was gay, since ""I've been trying to hard to please myself from men"". We broke up. The very next day, I get bombarded with text messages. My friends asked if this was true, and they linked me to a post. It was a Facebook (who uses Facebook) post (exposing me) about me cheating. She said that's why we broke up. Now I usually am not evil, but this pissed me off. She was destroying my reputation, for god knows why. I simply commented that the real reason that we broke up was because she is gay. People didn't believe me, until my ex literally screamed at me for outing her. Then a lot of people started to call her out for her lies. I know I'm probably a huge asshole. Though I feel like she deserves it. But alas, AITA? No. I did not cheat on her. Yes. I did have sex with someone the day that we broke up. But it was after."
57,Not the A-hole,AITA for reporting my car stolen when my sister took it after I told her not to?,33856,bp8v29,4415,"My sisters car broke down 6 months ago because of her own stupidity. I won't go into it here but she ignored the advice of a mechanic and because of that her car broke. I decided to be nice and offer my sister my car until she could get hers fixed as i could bike to work while she needed to drive. She did not get her car fixed for some reason. She claimed to be saving money to do so but every time her paycheck came she spent it. My parents have even offered her a loan to fix her car but she refused. Along with all of this, she has been abusing my generosity and taking my car all day and night. I told her she could use it for work but is seems to her that is a free pass to use my car, not fill it with gas, and take it when I specifically tell her not to.&#x200B;Recently I've been needed to get to work very early and I really don't feel like riding my bike 6 miles at 3 in the morning so I told my sister she had 30 days until I took the spare key from her and she is no longer allowed to use it. That was 32 days ago. Yesterday morning she woke up specifically before me to take my car (at 2:30 in the morning). I called her and demanded she bring it back but she just hung up on me. because of this I reported it stolen.&#x200B;My sister was arrested 30 minutes later and my parents had to go bail her out. My sister is now facing charges for unauthorized use of a car and my parents and her are pissed. They claim I want way to far here but honestly, i feel justified. My parents are worried if she's found guilty she will loose her job but in my opinion, it's her own fault. Am i wrong here? Am i an asshole?"
58,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling my husband that his culture is garbage and I won't ""compromise"" by incorporating it into our family life?",33704,i79ikq,3097,"My husband and I live in the US northeast, where I am from. “John” moved here for work several years ago, from the deep south of the US where he grew up, raised with Christian holidays but never attending church. Coincidentally, shortly before everything hit, John’s parents AND his childhood best friend “Dan” and his wife decided to move here as well.This past weekend was the first that us three couples have gathered together since any of us moved here; we had a “distanced picnic” at our house. John sat down 2-3 minutes after I did, as he was settling our kid into his pen in the yard with us. Dan and my FIL immediately started to “jokingly” rip on him for being “whipped” and doing “my” job of parenting our child while he was supposed to be “allowed” to just catch up with the two other men. I was trying to politely deflect when it turned to how “mean” I was for not “fixing him a plate” and serving him  before serving myself. (If I thought a certain dish would run out before he got to it, or if he had asked me to, I of course would have!) Dan and FIL continued to brag about how their families ""do it right"", where they handle the “outside chores” while their wives handle the “inside chores” (including the care of Dan and his wife’s two children). I think it’s important to note here that both currently live in rented condos that by their nature do not have “outdoor chores”, and **both their wives have always worked full time, as I do**.The whole day was kind of wrecked by that start, and I was frustrated when John left with Dan and FIL to “go for a walk” and left me to do all the clean up alone while also looking after our kid. I expected John to apologize when he returned hours later, but instead HE got at ME for “making \[him\] look bad” in front of his friend and dad. He brought up how “a traditional division of labor” is “a huge part of southern culture”, and how I was being “disrespectful” to his background by “forcing northern culture” onto him and his family. He said he’s been building up a lot of “resentment” the past few months that I “make” him do half the chores and childcare, since in his “culture”, women do the chores and hands-on childcare, and men do the fun parenting, the discipline, mow the grass, and bring in the cars for oil changes when needed.I was stunned but honest and told him southern culture is garbage. It's bigotry. I lived in John's home state for 8 years, and I saw how ""southern hospitality"" is reserved only for those in your in-group. Deviate from the norm--be queer, non-Christian, a POC, a liberal, a non-traditional woman--and they turn on you viciously. Does every single person act like that always? No. But it's the culture. John is livid and says his ""culture"" is just as valid as that of other global regions, religions, and ethnic groups, so I am the bigot by not ""compromising"" with him here and incorporating aspects of his culture into our family life the way I would if his ""culture"" was ""Islamic or Asian or whatnot""."

I am sick of being a part of it, I had ""NO PHOTOS"" hoodies printed for me and my little sister.",33625,evqd98,3404,"I am a teenager and my mom is kinda famous on Instagram and blogging. She had a mommy blog all when I was growing up and of course me and my sister were always involved. It sucks because there's so much our there about us and it's what's gonna come up when I'm looking for a job, when I'm dating, when anyone looks up my name.I found a website that will print custom jackets, print all over the front and back and arms... And I ordered some hoodies that say a bunch of phrases all over them.""No photos"" ""no videos"" ""i do not consent to be photographed"" ""no means no"" ""respect my privacy"" ""no cameras"" ""no profiting off my image""It sounds silly but it looks pretty sick actually. I got one for me and one for my nine year old sister who's started to not always want photos.And I guess the idea is that my mom can't take good looking pictures, even candid ones, with us in the hoodies without them having a pretty strong message that we don't want to be in pictures.My mom was mad when they showed up, and really mad when I'm wearing mine. Like she says she just wants pictures to remember my young years by, she won't post ones without askingBut I know that's a whole mess anyway; she always says that and then negotiates me into letting her post, like either by saying that's how she makes income so if I want money for something, to stop arguing about pictures. Or posting without asking and then saying I thought it would be ok because you're face wasn't visible / you're just in the background, etc.And I'm always like ""no you didn't THINK. if you thought at all you'd remember what I said I want. No new pictures of me or mentions of me online. Remove all pictures that include me that you've ever posted. and delete any writing that mentions me. I am just so fed up, and upset that my mom is mad at me for wearing my new hoodie everyday. She's mad I won't take it off for any event and thinks it's inappropriate to wear to certian things.I know it's really weird looking but it feels like my only option.Edit to add a couple more things... She also says all the mentions of consent and ""no means no"" and ""this body is my own"" (sorry forgot to mention that one earlier) imply something more inappropriate and that it is really inappropriate to wear those words out in public. We've also fought about me wearing it to family events and school events with a generally dressier dress code, because it looks like a ""gangster hoody"". I don't know what to say to that, but I don't agreeAITA for always wearing my no photos hoodie?"
60,Not the A-hole,AITA for wanting my daughter’s boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance to know her dark secret before marriage?,33522,briguv,4975,"I’m the dad of a 25 year old young woman who I love very much. I’ve been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and I enjoy my time with her, but there’s one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.She exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, I realized she needed professional help. Throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. With an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. She received an ASPD diagnosis at 18, and I had suspected it for long prior.After her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. She’s law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. Especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. She uses that old dating guide “The Rules” like a Bible. She currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who’s crazy about her, and who I have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). He is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.But I doubt she loves him. We’ve had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she’s been open with me that she doesn’t feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. When she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt “pretty neutral” about the whole thing. She has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she’s ever done, and doesn’t know what guilt feels like. While she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, I highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.Her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she’s been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it’ll scare him away. I’ve made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or I will**; to which she always responds, “I know you wouldn’t dare.” I actually would - I really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this “secret” from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.I’m not trying to sabotage my daughter’s future. **Maybe** her boyfriend’s love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won’t end the relationship. It’s his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. Someday he’s bound to find out she’s a bit “off”; it can’t be kept a secret forever. AITA?"
61,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting upset that my sister’s fiancé pulled me aside and patted me down at their wedding?,33399,cmvrbe,3039,"The title sounds so stupid but here we go anyways.I’m 24 and I’m an addict who has been in recovery for the past six months. I used and used until I was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than once. She’s my best friend and I know it hurt her a lot to see me like that. She also met her fiancé two years ago and he really only knew me as the junkie brother then. He’s not my biggest fan to say the least considering how much I put my sister through. Despite this she still invited me to her wedding last week because I am her brother and she wanted me to be there. When I get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in. When I walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure I “didn’t bring anything in”.  I instinctively pull away, because why wouldn’t I, and I tell him not to touch me. He tells me to “calm down” and that if I want to be here then he needs to do this. I tell him he’s being ridiculous and I try to push past him. He stops me and tells me that he doesn’t want to throw me out but he “will if he has to.” I told him that he’s trying to look tough but it’s just making him look stupid. At this point I’m getting more and more angry and I’m practically yelling in his face at this point. Bystanders came between us and separated us and told my BIL to just “drop it.” He said he would but that “they can deal with it when I get out of hand.”I just went to go find a seat after that. After the reception, a lot of my family told me that I should’ve let him just do it and that I was acting like a huge asshole and like I had “something to hide.” I don’t think he had any right to pat me down, especially in front of people and I don’t think my reaction was over the top. If anything, he was the one acting like a huge douche by trying to start drama so he can look tough. My sister has refused to take any sides in this. AITA?"

My son told us that he took the TV to the dump as it was shattered and useless. My daughter and son-in-law (my 4yo granddaughters parents) felt very bad for what had happened and paid the cost of the TV that day.My husband was watching our security cameras and our son's story doesn't hold up. We never see our granddaughter breaking the TV. All that we see is our son taking away the TV that is not shattered. We asked our son about this and he said that the security camera must have cut out the part that shows our granddaughter breaking the TV.Eventually I got a call from my son's girlfriend that lives with him. She said that she knew what was going on and felt guilty. She basically told us that our son had made up the story about the TV breaking and stole it and took it to their house to watch. I filed a police report and his girlfriend let the police into their house to get us our TV back. We do plan on pressing charges against him. He stole our TV and made my daughter pay for it. That is messed up on so many levels. AITA for pressing charges?"
63,Not the A-hole,AITA for saying my sister needs to stop bringing up her miscarriage for attention?,32961,eejyso,2225,"Okay this is a doozy, so please strap in and bear with me. For context here, my sister is 30, I am 22. Ten years ago, my sister had a miscarriage. Obviously, it was devastating for her and the whole family and it took her a couple of years to fully heal from it. We're still not 100% sure why it happened, but it was a one off and she's since had three very healthy, beautiful children, including a set of twins. So here's the thing. My sister and I don't really get on. She resented me as a kid because she had to share mum's attention and because she thought mum left her dad to be with mine. Never really grew out of that resentment and she was pretty much my biggest bully throughout childhood and my teenage years. One thing she absolutely cannot stand is when  mum and I do things without her, or when mum pays more attention to me than to her. When this happens she calls mum and says she's feeling really upset about the miscarriage and without fail mum goes running. This includes a trip to Paris I took mum on for her birthday earlier this year, which she cut short because sister said she needed her. Also includes when I had a manic episode so bad I was hospitalised and sister managed to need mum every time she was planning to visit me and so she never did. Note, these times when mum is spending more time with me than her are the only times sister brings up what happened and certainly the only times she still gets so upset about it. So recently I was sick. Like, don't leave the bathroom for days, can only keep water down sick. Didn't manage to get the doctor, but I think it was norovirus. It lasted about a week Mum was popping in daily on her way home from work to check on me and stuff. On the last day of being seriously unwell, when I felt I could eat again, Mum offered to make me some soup while she was there, which I accepted. She was halfway through making it when sister called her saying she was upset about the miscarriage and she told me I'd have to finish it myself because she had to go. I didn't say anything to Mum and I finished making the soup, but I sent my sister a text saying she really needs to stop bringing it up for attention because she can't bear me getting some instead. I guess she told mum and her dad because I'm hearing from all sides what a horrible, insensitive, selfish bastard I am and how dare I say that to her. I understand she may still be traumatised, I just think it's really weird how that trauma solely manifests whenever I'm getting attention and she isn't. AITA?"
64,Not the A-hole,AITA for helping my friend get a girl removed from the soccer team?,32659,i3t3vb,1849,"I (16f) have a friend named Aysha (15f). Aysha is Muslim and wears a hijab to school which often causes people to give her dirty looks, comments, etc. I don’t know why. It’s just cloth. Anyway the worst instance possible was with this girl named Megan (also 15f). When we were sitting together at lunch she came up to Aysha and I and told Aysha she dared her to take her hijab off, taunting her saying she would look so pretty without it. (This was with malicious intent because I told her one time thinking she was just clueless and wanted to educate her)Then she forcibly tried to remove her hijab. I moved her hand away and we went to the principal. Instead of getting a punishment, Megan made up a sob story about how it would harm her position on some prestigious soccer club she was in. Fast forward to a few days ago. She makes a TikTok that said “when you get called to the principals office for telling the Muslim girl to take off her durag”. I was so livid for her. Aysha is very shy and didn’t want to seem like a buzzkill, so she asked me personally to email the soccer organization. Well, I did, and she was immediately kicked off and other organizations in the area were notified of her behavior. Now, all of her friends are in my dms saying how horrible I am, how I’m a retard, how I need to take a joke, etc. my parents think I should have stayed out of it. But I think I did the right thing."

I got up to go to the bathroom, and when I came back, I noticed my taco looked tampered with. I go to inspect, and lo and behold, there’s fucking cheese buried underneath the other ingredients.I told my boyfriend he was a raging douchecanoe and went to bed, leaving him to do the cleanup. I still haven’t spoken to him all morning, and he’s complaining about how I ""forced"" him to do the dishes, because normally I do them. AITA here?"
66,Not the A-hole,"AITA for saying that my daughter inherits my house ""no matter what""?",32572,k9husr,2211,"I'm a single mom in my 50s with one daughter. I got very lucky in that I bought a home in the Bay Area nearly 30 years ago for around $230K before the tech boom and now the house is worth about $1M. I have a 23 year old daughter Camila who grew up in that house and she moved out last year to go live with her boyfriend. I've never explicitly told my daughter ""the house will be yours"" nor has she asked anything about it, but just sort of common sense - that's my daughter. Who else would I give it to?One important note - There are 2 homes in the neighborhood that are owned by lower middle class people (me and a neighbor who's been here as long as I have). Otherwise, our neighbors are engineers and software developers. The Bay Area is simply un-affordable if you're not in tech. My daughter is a hair stylist.My fiance Steven and I have been together for 2 years. He has 2 young children (elementary school) he has joint custody of who I adore and I'm excited to help raise them. Steven and I don't have a ton in the bank so a pre-nup seemed silly if it weren't for the house. I told him that I'm ready to combine finances and plan long term with him, but I wanted a pre-nup agreement just for the house. It's a non-negotiable for me that my daughter inherits the house. He wasn't happy with this. He said that $1M split 3 ways is enough for all 3 kids to get a headstart in life. I disagree, I paid 80% of the mortgage by myself and Camila is my only child. She can have her dream life (working as a hair stylist, living in the Bay Area) with this house but will be unhappy (have to move out to a less desirable area) if it's split. I spoke to Camila about this and she agrees that she should get the house and said she always planned on inheriting it, just like I always planned on giving it to her."
67,Not the A-hole,AITA for taking back my nephews Christmas present and giving it to my son.,32572,jupcwq,2774,"My sister and I have always had a strained relationship. I usually just let things go and try to keep the piece. We both have sons who are around the same age. My nephew is 13 and my son just turned 11. For my sons birthday I bought him the new gaming system he has been wanting. He was absolutely thrilled and he plays nonstop. My sister is bad with money. I usually have to lend her money for bills and stuff for my nephew. I know my nephew doesn’t always get the best Christmas gifts so this year I went a little crazy and I purchased the same gaming system for him for Christmas. I already had it ready and wrapped under my tree.Yesterday my sisters family came to visit. My son asked me if they could go play video games. I said yes and reminded them to be careful. About 30 minutes later my son comes running to me crying. I asked him what was wrong and he led me to the front hall. When we get to the stairs I see the new system smashed on the floor. Someone had thrown it from the upstairs and it was now smashed to pieces.I asked my son what happened and he sobbed and pointed at his cousin. I asked my nephew if he did this and he started to laugh. He said that it was a “stupid baby toy” and that he saw people break them online. My sister came in and I told her what happened. I explained that this was an expensive system and that her son needs to be disaplined for what he did. I told her I wanted her to pay for what her son broke.She laughed and said no. She says I shouldn’t have let them play unsupervised. That it was my fault and that I am a bad parent. She said my son will get over it and that it was not important. Seeing my son sitting on the ground next to his broken system trying to put the pieces back together tore my heart out. I walked over to the Christmas tree and grabbed the system that was meant for my nephew. I pulled the gift wrap off and it gave it to son and told him to go upstairs and set it up.My sister asked me why I was making such a big deal when I had another one already. I than laughed and told her that was her sons Christmas gift. That since it wasn’t important and it was just a stupid baby toy than they obviously won’t miss it. I than told them to leave.My nephew realized what happened and began to cry that my son had stole his system. I said no his was the one that he smashed. My sister was livid and told me that I will never see them again. I just said okay and slammed the door.Other family members have now been calling me nonstop and saying I am an asshole and that I ruined my nephews Christmas. I don’t think so though. My nephew is 13. He is not a stupid kid and he knew what he was doing. I don’t care that it was over jealousy, he is old enough to know better. My sister was not going to make the situation right so I just did what I had to do.They all think I should buy another new system for him but I don’t have that kind of money. I’m starting to feel bad about this and I am wondering AITA?"
68,Not the A-hole,AITA for blowing up at my friend who constantly makes comments about my boobs?,32360,giww2y,2477,"I have big boobs. I’m currently at 52kg and there’s nothing I can do to change the size of these things unless I have surgery. I’m also extremely shy and from a very conservative family so my resentment and shame towards my bust is an ongoing issue. My friend *Sarah is one of those unfiltered free thinkers who says whatever is on her mind. She’s also slim and her chest is very much in proportion to the rest of her body. We work together and I’m always secretly jealous of how great shirts and tops look on her whereas I feel I look very sloppy and unprofessional with oversized, ill fitting clothes. Sarah has this way of always bringing up my boobs in conversation, starting off complimentary but often ending with an subtle insult. She knows they’re a physical feature I’m uncomfortable with but doesn’t let up. Examples of things she’ll say is how my boobs look good now but give it a few years, and they’ll be down to my knees, hahaha! Or she’ll show me comments on reddit where people are discussing chest size preferences and most are commenting how they much prefer a smaller bust over large. Or just a general reminder of how work or men will never take me seriously because of my ‘cartoon boobs’. I know she’s trying to have lighthearted fun but it gets to me and I’ve told her a few times to drop it before. Now we’re working from home, we all have daily video calls and meetings. Uniform is not necessary and can wear what we like. A few days ago, it was extremely hot and I was wearing a lighter, more revealing top than my usual baggy coverups. During this video call, in front of 6 other colleagues, Sarah starts vocalising her thoughts on my appearance: *‘Holy shit! Put those away! You look like you’re in a porno. We don’t need to see that first thing in the morning, hahaha.’* I was mortified. One other colleague laughed along but the rest looked uncomfortable. I felt close to tears, made an excuse and left the meeting. Sarah called me up half an hour later asking me what was wrong and I went off on her. Told her to go fuck herself and was sick of her constant jabs about my appearance. I went on a 10 minute tirade and hung up. Sarah has been off sick since that day and we haven’t spoken again. I’m wondering if I was too harsh and maybe should call and apologise for my outburst? Was I TA?**Edit:** I’m fuming. I just spoke with a colleague, *John, (who was part of the video call that day) and he told me that Sarah’s been telling everyone that it’s ME that’s been bullying her and making her feel insecure about her appearance. When she made those comments during the meeting, it was in retaliation to how I’ve made her feel. Apparently, I said she looks like a boy and called her flat chested and ugly several times in the past. I have NEVER and would never say this! I don’t even understand the stupid ‘boy body’ insult because a small bust has always looked very beautiful and classy in my eyes. Anyway, John knows she’s full of shit and has suggested we speak with HR. The others will also back me up. I know most people here suggested I do this and I wasn’t sure at first but fuck it, I’m reporting her. I don’t know why I ever considered her a friend, she’s fucking mental and annoying.**Edit 2:** I now feel stupid for even asking the question AITA. I thought I may have been at one point because the video call was amongst mostly work mates rather than clients and I wasn’t sure if my sensitivity towards my body image made me overreact to a joke that could have been innocent (I now realise it wasn’t).I’ve also spoken to another coworker who is closer to Sarah and she thinks Sarah may have  already reported me to HR. She said the phone conversation we had after the meeting was filled with abusive bullying language and physical threats. It wasn’t a pleasant phone call but the worst thing I said was she go fuck herself and that I don’t want to speak to her again. The rest of the conversation was just rehashing all the comments she made about my body and how it made me feel. She also claimed that I have been making inappropriate jokes about her appearance and work ethic(?) through the years and this confrontation was a long time coming. She also suggested that I’ve convinced the guys in the office to take my side by being a flirt and a tease (did I mention that I’m stupidly shy?)My head is swimming and I think I may be dealing with an actual psycho. I don’t know how it’s come to this ridiculous level of craziness. All I wanted to do was get on with my fucking work in peace and get through this crappy time but now I have to deal with this bullshit.**Update:** Just to answer a few questions I’ve seen:- I’ve contacted HR with my complaint. I have a lot of old text messages and emails with comments and memes Sarah has sent making fun of my chest size. John and other colleagues are fully supporting me as well as my manager. It will take a while for them to get back to me but I’m confident that things will be sorted and Sarah will be dealt with.- My breasts alone aren’t 52kg (114lbs). My overall weight is 52kg. I mentioned this because my chest seems much larger on my small frame making clothes that others wear and look nice in, look completely gaudy and cheap on me. I can’t lose anymore weight to make a difference on my bust size. I won’t get surgery but I have been working on my body image issues which my shyness and upbringing did a number on. People’s comments don’t usually devastate me as they once did but Sarah obviously tried her best to break me down.- Thank you to all for clothing suggestions. I will definitely look into tailoring some tops and have spent some time checking out Bravissimo which looks great.- In hindsight, I should have confronted Sarah more sternly in the past but I guess I was trying to avoid conflict. Others have suggested I may have allowed her to gaslight me which may be true. I just want to move on at this point.**Update 2:**The coworker (*Lucy), who keeps in contact with Sarah and told me earlier that Sarah may have reported me to HR, has just phoned to tell me that Sarah has suffered a serious panic attack. Lucy does not want to take sides but has suggested I reconsider taking drastic action. Sarah is too unwell to talk to me herself but has asked I drop my complaint and she will drop hers, citing the whole thing as a misunderstanding and stress-induced disagreement. I have had panic attacks before in my life and I seriously felt like I was going to die. It’s a horrible feeling and if Sarah has honestly just had one herself, I don’t want to push her too far. I still want to address her comments over the video call but I’m wondering if I should just drop the other complaints. Sarah has asked to move teams so we don’t directly work with one another but it doesn’t seem she wants to apologise yet. And just to clarify to people who assume I was wearing a bikini top or boob tube during the meeting, I wasn’t. It was a short sleeved plain tshirt which hugged my breasts more than my usual baggy tops. I don’t like to hold grudges and I think getting her fired during a time like this may be a shitty thing to do. I feel she has already punished herself by displaying this fucked up behaviour to others and losing a lot of respect from coworkers. If we don’t ever have to interact with one another, I’m up for that. I have a suspicion that Sarah may have found this post and read it which I thought I would feel bad about but I really don’t care.**Last Update:**I’m not dropping any of the complaints. Sarah (fuck you Michelle) and I have spoken, and although it started off promising, she is mentally unhinged and without a conscience. I did not realise how deep her hatred runs. Not only did she mock all those things I had told her in confidence about the way my family treated me growing up, she accused me of fucking every guy from work to get ahead. Now I know where some of those fake office rumours about me came from. I’ve been such a naive idiot and allowed my shyness and aversion to conflict to stop me from fighting people who manipulate and walk all over me. I don’t need this misery in my life. If she’s reading this, get professional help immediately. I know you desperately fancy John and, as you said, despise the way he looks at me. I know it bothers you that he took my side and has been a great support. Maybe I will go for drinks with him when lockdown ends. If I don’t make any new updates, just assume that the right person was reprimanded and faced the consequences of their words and actions."
69,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I called off my wedding because my fiance does not want my son to bring his boyfriend to the wedding?,32360,btvqmi,4858,"My son was born when I was only 15 years old, and I’ve been a single dad since I was 18. It was hard living for a long time money-wise but I always tried to do best by my son. Today I own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. He came out to me when he was 14 years old and I’ve always been supportive of him and his identity. I’ve been with my fiancé now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son – at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. My son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and I’ve gotten to know him really well. However my fiancé told me recently that she does not want my son’s boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. That if they found out, they would have a complete fit. This really bothered me because I refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. What is going to happen in the future? When my son gets married himself? Will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? He’s my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. When I told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that I was being selfish and over-dramatic – that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. I told her that this was unacceptable and that I was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. It’s my wedding too and I was his boyfriend there. After that I got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn’t been discussed again. However, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. I do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. I love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. I told my brother and he said that I was being the asshole here – that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it’s unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his “step grandparents” in the future anyway. I still don’t feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. Would I be the asshole if I did this? Am I being unreasonable here?"
70,Not the A-hole,AITA for writing a bad yelp review about my childs daycare calling them racist,32297,lqk99w,1369,**UPDATE: i haven't logged into this account in a while but i tried to update and it got removed so i will just copy and paste it into here****I decided to ask my daughter how she feels about all of this and she said that she likes going to daycare and that all of her friends are there. I got a lot of nice replies and awards and i am very thankful for all of the support i have been getting. I'm having my daughter come home from school with her grandma instead of the daycare. I emailed the owner of the daycare franchise (not the manager) and they are very furious and have decided to let go the people who were participating in this. I am not going to report them yet unless they do this again and i am in a group chat with the parents and i told them to all tell me if they do this to their kids again and i am afraid that reporting the place could make a lot of the people who didn't know about this lose their jobs. Turns out the manager and her friends were just power tripping. I am not very confrontational and my husband also said reporting would not be a good idea since if they close down other parents would lose childcare.**A while ago my daughter\[8f\] was complaining about her daycare because they were not giving her sunscreen. she asked for sunscreen but they said that black people do not need sunscreen but they actually do. before covid they went on a field trip and they made all the black kids sit in the sun and made the white kids sit in the shade because it would damage their skin or some bs. i talked to the ladies at the daycare and they said that it was justified but said if we brought in a doctors note they would give her sunscreen. i made my daughter take it to school and let her share it with other kids but then the teacher took it saying she was not allowed to do that without permission. The other day she came home with a bad sunburn and her skin was peeling and i had enough and wrote that they were racist and segregating kids and that she could get skin cancer because they are forcing her in the sun without sunscreen. i sent the lady in charge articles about cancer and that black people can get sunburned and sent her names of the workers who enforced this. she said that they were under her orders and that she was right because we have more protection against this and said that i was blowing this out of proportion and asked me to take my review down. I am seriously thinking of contacting a news channel about this. my friend said i am being a karen for complaining publicly and that black people have melanin so that gives them lots of protection that other kids dont haveEDIT: we live in the deep south
71,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my husband that I won't punish my daughter for speaking another language in the house because it upsets his son?,32237,if3rmj,2789,"This is a shitty situation but here we go. Me and my daughter, Anya, are from India. Our native language is Hindi. She 11 years old now. Her father died when she was 5 and I immigrated to states because everyone was trying to get me remarried to a 60 year old sleazebag because ""oh no. How ever will a woman live or raise a child alone"". I stated dating my now-husband when Anya was 6. He had a 5 year old son, Ben (50% custody). Me, Anya, Ben, Husband and Ben's mum get along really well. The kids were very well adjusted and they were genuinely happy when we got married. Whenever tensions arose, we dealt with them patiently. Let's just say after walking through the minefield of Indian family/drama, diffusing these toy bombs were very easy. Anya has a habit of talking in Hindi when she gets really excited. Sometimes, while talking to me, she starts talking in Hindi without even realising it. This wasn't a problem. If she does that while others are around, I would remind her and she would revert back to English. Few months ago, Ben's mum passed away and he came to live with us full time. He has a room already and we put Ben into therapy immediately. A week ago, Ben walked in when me and Anya were cooking and we were talking in Hindi and he started crying. He told me he is feeling bad that he can't understand what we are saying. I hugged him and consoled him and assured him that we didn't do it to exclude him purposefully. And then Anya started crying and apologised. The whole thing was just heartbreaking. Since then, Anya has been making concious efforts to talk only in English and I can tell that it puts Ben at ease. Yesterday, however, she was frustrated and started lamenting about school work in Hindi to me. Me and Anya were in the living room and Ben and husband were in the kitchen and they heard it. Later that night, my husband told me how he thinks we must start thinking about giving punishments whenever she speaks in Hindi unconsciously until Ben starts feeling better. I was horrified at this suggession. I have never pulled the ""She is my daughter, not yours"" card. But this is the hill I am willing to die on and use that card if necessary. Whether he likes it or not, it's her first language. Expecting her to always converse in her second language, even when she is feeling some extreme emotions is just cruel. Especially after she is genuinely making an effort to make Ben feel more comfortable. It's almost like punishing for her heritage or for her being Indian. Of course, this is a huge point of conflict between me and my husband. I think it's unfair to do this to Anya, even temporarily. He thinks me and Anya are unnecessarily making feel Ben bad while he is mourning his mother, while we can try and prevent it. Both of us are conflicted here. Who is the asshole here?"
72,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to RSVP to my sister’s wedding because I’m required to write an “application essay” just to attend?,32181,hzyy7b,3799,"Yeah I know this sounds insane but I’m living in it. So my sister is getting married next February, destination wedding no less. I have doubts whether this wedding is actually going to happen with the pandemic and everything but she is totally set on moving forward.Anyways because of the pandemic, her original venue has made her cut down on guests because they’re cutting capacity by half. As a result she’s sending out “re-invites” that asks everyone to RSVP again. But in order to figure out who to invite and who to cut, she’s asking all confirmed guests to submit two 250-word “essays” to two questions. The gist is that they’ll use these essays to choose who can come or not, based on people’s enthusiasm. People who don’t write the essays at all will be automatically disqualified.I just feel really insulted by all of this. The questions aren’t even pandemic-related, its broad topics like ”why do you still want to celebrate this day with us?” And “what will attending our wedding mean to you specifically?” So she’s blatantly looking for people to kiss ass and tell her why they REALLY want to go. Anyways I told her in advance I’m not writing 500 words on why I NEED to attend her wedding, spend my own money on plane tickets/hotels, and buy her a present. This has really rubbed her and my parents the wrong way. She’s said that to keep things fair if I don’t fill out the RSVP correctly I won’t be saved a spot. I said fine with me. Then my parents said if I don’t show up I’m going to be in big fucking trouble with all our relatives so just write the essays. AITA if I stay stubborn on this? I’m already annoyed at the thought of spending thousands and coming home to quarantine. But I will not belt out 500 words on how this is totally my choice. AITA?Edit: I’m 27F. I don’t live with family but she is my only sister.Edit2: Sister has framed these essays as “surveys” but there’s a word limit requirement so if you don’t reach it on the google forms you can’t even submit. Parents think this is perfectly reasonable, nice even, because sister is letting everyone have the chance to attend."
73,Not the A-hole,AITA for not forgiving my(27) fiance(28) for missing the birth of our daughter?,32132,hvzvwg,2247,"My husbands girl best friend (we'll call her Madison) has never liked me, for reasons I guess I will never know. Anyways my fiance (we'll call him Michael) and I were having a hangout with a little bit of the friends that we shared. It was nearing the end of the night and Madison was the only ""friend"" left when Madison came out crying with Michael looking angry, (I was around nine months pregnant at the time). The thing that really caught my attention is when Michael called me a raging b\*\*\*\* and a c\*\*t. Myself being a hormonal pregnant women started crying at the name calling. I asked through my tears what was going on and he then proceeds to tell me about a text message I sent to Madison. In the message I told her to f\*\*\* off and about how Michael and I would not allow her near our child. I will admit that I did send this, but it was taken completely out of context, I only sent this text after the many racist text messages that she sent me talking about my child and I. I am biracial. Instead of hearing me out Michael kicked me out of the house that we shared (his name was on the lease). Without arguing I decided to leave not wanting to start anything else, as I was walking out the door I felt a cramp in my lower abdomen. I thought nothing of this because I was not due for another three weeks, when I flinched from the pain Michael told me to stop faking. On the way to my moms house I felt a gush of water and immediately turned the car around so that I would make it to the hospital. While driving I took out my phone to call Michael but my call was quickly declined. At this point I was in to much pain to call anyone else and arrived at the hospital. I pushed for two hours without an epidural and gave birth to a beautiful baby girl named Grace Noel. Giving birth without my fiance by my side was the final straw for me, I decided to do something and post all the hurtful messages Madison sent me on facebook. Maybe 45 min-1 hour later Michael calls me asking me if we could talk, I inform him about my whereabouts and he shows up about  42 minutes later. He has tried to apologize multiple times, But I dont think I can forgive him. I went through the pain of pushing out an 8 pound baby by myself all because he chose to believe his best friend without listening to his fiance.AITA for not wanting to forgive him??"
74,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my male friend that he’s shit at sex,31936,h0jty3,2393,"One of my (24F) male friends, I’ll call Jack (25M), is a bit of a lad and very good looking. Jack basically thinks that lad points are important, he’s always going on about how many girls he’s been with and how high is body count is. I lived with him in a house share for a while and whenever he bought a girl home, he’d make sure to parade her around by introducing her, spend 15-20mins in his room having sex, then come out and strut around naked or in his boxers..yes he really would. I remember saying a few times why are you out here, you have a beautiful girl in your room and you’re not in there with her?This behaviour was pretty common for him and even though he was an almighty douche, we were still friends. Anyway after about 8 months of living together, after a drunken night, me and Jack ended up in bed together. Honestly it was terrible and having slept with him I realised something. Jack had a big dick (which I knew because of his strutting) but he thought that having a big dick automatically meant he was good at sex. Like it just immediately made him amazing in bed. Our sex was shit, like hands down the worst sex I’d ever had. No foreplay, he left lights and tv on, then unceremoniously shoved himself inside me. The whole thing was basically a race for him to get inside me as quickly as possible. Maybe 10 minutes of uncomfortable jackhammering then he was done. The next morning I was really sore because 1. I wasn’t wet at all 2. His dick was big. But because I was sore he took that as him doing a bang up job. Anyway that experience was a few years ago, and even after all this time, Jack is still the same lad he was and still fucks girls like they’re lined up on a conveyor belt for him. Back to the present. Recently, my husband and I hosted a bbq in our garden as gatherings are now allowed. Jack came over as he’s in our mutuals group. Of course after a while Jack starts going on about the girls he’s fucked, and even showing up another girl at the party by telling people he’d fucked her. It’s then he turns to me and asks if I can prove to the lads how “fire” he is at sex. Slightly embarrassed but also angry he even mentioned me, I straight up told him he was shit. Basically worst sex I ever had, I then went onto say what happened and that he only has sex just to say that he’s had sex. It wasn’t fun, pleasurable or enjoyable and for the record I didn’t come. Amazingly enough, two other girls also backed up what I was saying. Saying their nights with him were pretty much the same to how I described it. Jack got defensive and angry but we wouldn’t drop it. He eventually left absolutely fuming. My husband, who knows I slept with him years before said I was insensitive, especially as it seems jack relies heavily on the lad/sex God persona he’s created. I don’t think so, it was about time Jack was called out for being shit in bed and maybe use this to learn how to actually have sex.  All the boys in the group think I’m an ass for calling Jack out, me and the girls disagree.EDIT: - Holy cow this got way more attention than I thought it would! Thanks for all the comments.l and thank you kind strangers for the awards!!Should clear a few things up. A lot of people asking why I was or am friends with Jack. I was back then, because honestly at times he was a decent guy, just blanketed by a douchey exterior. After I moved out of the house, we fell out of close contact but are still hovering in mutual friend circles. I’m not directly friends with him now but he’s still a friend of a friend and we are normally civil.EDIT #2: I really don’t get why people are misunderstanding the story. For the record I did not cheat on my husband. Jack and I had a one night stand together years ago while we were at uni. I wouldn’t consider him my friend now but we still have mutuals from different social circles and we do occasionally still see one another.INFO: Basically my friend group (close/mutual/extended) all knew or knew of each other at uni. I’m British and now live in the states. I attended Uni between the ages of 18 - 21. At 19 I went to the states for a year abroad, and the sister Uni is where I met my now husband. Jack is American and was an international student doing exchange, I was first year he was second year. I, a first year, ended up living with Jack because I decided to go to uni last minute, and as Halls were full, ended up responding to a house share ad (a lot of students drop out after making a house share commitment so these ads are common)I actually met my husband (also American) through Jack, as Jack was one of my only known contacts when I moved to the states. (My British uni and his American uni were linked) I met my husband a year AFTER I slept with Jack. I could not possibly have had any idea that my housemate and one night stand would go on to introduce me to my future husband. My husband knew Jack and I slept together because unfunnily enough, Jack brought it upon our first meeting.Living together, Jack and I mainly bonded over weed and raves, and although he was sometimes somewhat decent, looking back I’m disgusted at our so called friendship. I could write an essay on how he treated me. > If anyone is interested in an update, I posted it here."
75,Not the A-hole,AITA for insulting a girl's weight after she went off on me for touching her purse on a crowded train?,31891,cmcou6,3199,"Train is packed, it's hot, I'm tired and looking for a place to sit. Everything was occupied, but at one point I see an old lady get up and start making her way to the doors. I went over to sit in new place, but found a purse in it instead, belonging to the girl in the window seat. I asked her if she could move the purse, but she didn't respond. I noticed she had headphones in, so I figured I'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as I'm sitting down.As soon as I touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck I was doing. I explained. She then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. I told her I knew for a fact she was alone because I just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. So I started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.This released an even bigger tirade and series of ""what the fuck is your problem""-s. I saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so I figured I'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her ""Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. My bad, I'll get up now"". I got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as I was walking away.I noticed some people gave me dirty looks, but others were chuckling, so I kinda wondered if I stepped too much out of line there."
76,Not the A-hole,AITA for allowing two teenagers to be spit on by a llama?,31814,cyt2nl,2844,"I work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama.I told them ""you might want to cut that out! Llamas spit in self-defense."" But they kind of laughed my warning off.Now, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.The llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a ""warning spit"" (just saliva) and they went ""eww"" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.Finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in.To make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.AITA? The girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. Maybe it was...I knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but I wanted the lesson to sink in as well."
77,Not the A-hole,AITA for gifting my sister pictures of my dog?,31772,ef49r2,2621,"I'm a bit of a jackass I will admit, but hear me out. So today I was at my parent's house to celebrate Christmas Eve with my side of the family (as this year I will be spending Christmas with my girlfriend's this year). Anyways, we opened presents up early this morning. Something I should note about my sister is that she LOVES her children. Which is great and I do love my nephews, but every year she gets me magnets, pictures, blankets and pretty much anything she can plaster her kids on. While it's nice, I don't have a shrine at my house dedicated to them and I know this might sound selfish, but I don't really want them as I don't know what to do with them. They end up in a drawer or something, cause one year she got me a large tapestry thing with her kids on it, and it was HUGE. Obviously I didn't want to hang it up as it quite literally covered the entire wall. I never say anything to her as I don't want to offend her and ruin Christmas.So that's when I had the genius idea of doing the same thing but with my dog. I put him in a little tie, took his picture and put it in a frame. I love my dog as my child, so I figured I'd gift it to my sister. (I also got her a $25 Starbucks card as she's obsessed with them and I wasn't trying to be petty). Anyways, she opens it up and her face drops. Then she goes to me and says, ""what the fuck am I supposed to do with this?"" Without a thought I said, ""same thing I do with yours, it'll look good on your coffee table"". Long story short, she got mad, my family is pretty much on my side expect for a couple of people who thought it was funny but in the end ""dogs aren't comparable to humans"". Which I don't necessarily agree with and wasn't the point of the gift, but whatever, I thought it was funny, but I need unbiased opinons, AITA?"
78,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my daughter to cancel her marriage?,31750,itd4ok,2455,"I have a daughter(27) who was with her boyfriend for 7 years and they  got engaged not long ago(just a small party, not many guests). She always talks to me about how she loved him, how he always listens to he and he was made for her. I have agreed with her, since I found i=him to be a good natured man, he was kind and humble and was always respectful to our family. We've met his parents for dinner twice or thrice and they hit me as a little sexist, asking questions to my wife like ""I don't know why you're working, isn't that the husband's job? Its the mothers job to be taking care of the children"".  Now that they wanted to make it more serious, they planned a marriage. Anyways we have been planning about the marriage, and one day her boyfriend comes to me and says that his parents want to talk to me. I was going to call my daughter too, but he said that she wasn't allowed. I went with him and his parents started talking with me about DOWRY. I was confused and said that there was no dowry and in 2020 who even gives dowry?? But boyfriend and his parents started lecturing me about how necessary it was and how my daughter would be a stay at home wife(my daughter has told me that she wants to continue her dreams so I don't know what this is). Anyways they told me that I should give it a thought and told me not to tell my daughter for the time being. However I immediately told my daughter about it, and she started crying saying she didn't know that her boyfriend was so sexist. She asked me what she could do now, and I told her that she wasn't being forced and could cancel her marriage if she didn't want it. Well, that is exactly what happened and now her boyfriend and his parents are calling me saying I took away the love of his life etc... On top of that, some of her friends (some were bridesmaids) said that I was a asshole for breaking up what would've been a ""healthy marriage"". But its my daughter's happiness that matters. AITA?"
79,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my autistic brother the truth when he asked me why women don’t like him?,31749,gbl3wk,2437,"I’ve got a younger brother (24) with Aspergers and he’s very high functioning albeit with his quirks. Recently I’ve moved back home during the stay at home orders to look after my parents. My brother still lives with them. I find out he’s been trying to date in recent months and confessed it’s been pretty unsuccessful for him. He even got to go on a first date but his date literally got up and left after about a half hour. I know exactly the reason why and it’s not flattering. For one thing my parents coddled him since he was a kid because he was on the spectrum and was the only boy in our family. My mom in particular always told him he was smarter and more advanced than everyone else who’s neurotypical. This has led to his belief today that he genuinely is smarter than everyone else, especially women who he thinks are inherently irrational, illogical people. So I know how he interacts with women like me or his other sisters. He tends to say very hurtful things first and when we get upset, he will then say things like “you are being irrational/hysterical/illogical, I’m just being honest and you can’t accept it.” This is like his catch phrase over the years and drives us absolutely INSANE. Anyways when he asked me I basically said, “listen the truth is your way of talking to women can come across as extremely demeaning and borderline sexist.” I told him he acts like he can read every woman perfectly when he’s pretty much always wrong. This struck the wrong nerve with him and he later complained to my parents that I attacked him over things he can’t control. Now I’m in hot water for “ruining his confidence” and I feel both bad and kinda relieved at the same time. This was the first time in my life I told him how annoying his behavior is because growing up our mom always blamed us whenever he got upset. But maybe I was too harsh? AITA for telling him what I said?"
80,Not the A-hole,AITA for laughing uncontrollably at my son when he asked me to replace a Christmas gift he broke out of anger?,31594,ei9igg,3456,"I know I likely am, but the extend of which I'm unsure about. My son is almost 17. This Christmas we bought him an expensive computer gaming chair, as he plays a lot of online multiplayer shooters. My son has some anger issues, which he's currently in therapy for, and these shooters tend to bring out his temper more than normal. However, for the past few months he's been keeping it together well, so I figured the chair might be a fair present. I was wrong, because the day after Christmas he was gaming, started to have bad luck and apparently people in-game were fucking with him because he was losing his patience. This culminated in him screaming insults and then picking up his chair and slamming it into the ground, breaking the back of it.After talking him down, we had a very serious conversation about him no longer being allowed to play multiplayer games while under my roof until his therapist feels comfortable with his progress, talked about coping mechanisms, etc. However, I made it very clear this was unacceptable and he would be grounded. We've had these heart-to-hearts many times, so it's not like every time he has an outburst I'm making light of it. It's a serious issue and treated like such.However, when he came to me later that day and told me he'd like me to replace the chair because it was a gift, he ""really liked it"" and ""it would only be fair"", the frustration, disbelief and disappointment in his behavior boiled over and I started laughing hysterically. As in a full laughing fit, barely able to breathe or talk. The more he'd plead his case, the harder I'd laugh, repeatedly asking him how it was ""fair"" in his mind to have me replace a gift I paid for that he broke in anger.This obviously pissed him off more, which led to him getting emotional, but I just couldn't seem to stop myself. I tried walking out of the room and asking him to drop it but every time he'd say ""but I need a chair!"" or ""What am I supposed to do now"" I'd laugh again. I tried explaining that I'm not laughing at his feelings, I'm laughing at how absurd it is for him as a teenager to expect me to replace shit he can't be bothered to treat with respect and then whine about it when he broke it.He's still pissed about it, and feels slighted. I feel bad for laughing, and honestly wonder if I had some sort of mini-stress break myself, because it's never happened before and I couldn't seem to stop. But at the same time, I stand by the fact that his request *was* ridiculous enough to make most people *want* to laugh. How badly did I fuck up?"
81,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling someone that his art sucks and he won't amount to much in life in front of his friends and family.,31530,9wg9ep,3340,"I have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that I hang out with almost every day. We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. I never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said ""Einstein"" once and John interrupted him to say, ""I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?"". I once put up a snapchat story saying, ""I love college football!"", and he replied to my story with ""It's called gridiron you moron"".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. On one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went ""I'm a Biomed Engineer"". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.Every time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, ""What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing"". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. Over the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, ""damn M0shka you famous now"" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like ""His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent."" At this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). Last week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, ""I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo"". To which he got angry again and said, ""I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you"". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. That's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, ""Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*"" His dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? "
82,Not the A-hole,AITA for making my daughter sleep in a tent,31509,k9y7o3,1990,"I (34F) am a single mother to two girls, 'Jasmine' (16F) and 'Jessica' (14F). Their dad died when I was pregnant with Jess, and I had to work hard. We hit rock bottom, and I was barely making paycheque to paycheque but I managed to get a degree, become successful and we live well. Point is, I know how fucking hard it is to be at the bottom of society, and my daughters know this, which is why I was livid at my daughter's actions.Yesterday, Jasmine showed me a video of Jessica cussing a homeless man out and telling him, 'stop asking me for money, you'd earn it yourself if you weren't so fucking lazy and spending what you earned on substances.' When the homeless man complained about the cold (we live in NE England), Jessica responded 'Yeah people camp for fun, even in December, you can't complain, you're living someone's holiday.' Fury was an understatement for what I felt, as I thought I had raised an empathetic daughter.Along with finding the homeless man and making her apologise and help pay for a hotel room for a night for him (she paid £20), as well as signing her up to volunteer at a food bank - I decided to take her up on her offer of sleeping outside. I locked her bedroom door so she couldn't go in, put a sign on it saying *Closed for the holidays,* pitched a tent in the garden and filled it with blankets and the sleeping bag I used when I was camping in Norway on a family holiday as a teen (aka really bloody thermal). I slept in the room closest to the garden for that night so I was nearby if anything was to go wrong. She was reluctant to do it, but chose it over the option of not having access to her phone until the Christmas holidays are over.In the morning, she was crying about how horrible it was to wake up on a cold mat and get disrupted sleep due to birds. After comforting her, I asked her would she like to do that everyday like the homeless man. It struck a cord with her and she was crying over her actions, while even after the £20 she was rolling her eyes and her apology was not sincere. This afternoon, I came home from work to Jessica making a big meal to donate to the homeless people who live on the road near our house. I was proud of how she turned over a new leaf, and after taking the food to the people, my sister came over. Apparently, my nephew and Jessica were talking at school, and he asked her about her plans for the afternoon, and she said that she was going to cook for the homeless. My nephew asked what triggered that, and Jess told him everything, which he relayed back to his mum. My sister said that my punishment was too harsh, and just the £20 and the food bank would have done the trick, and I was acting irrationally due to my past. Now I'm second guessing myself. AITA?"
83,Not the A-hole,AITA for suing my ex?,31490,h9emck,2625,"So I dated a YouTuber.We went out for about a year and it was alright but they were so emotionally invested in their channel that they constantly neglected me and made me feel like I wasn't a priority.Not really important why we broke up, but we broke up.Then I get a bunch of messages from friends about 3 months later telling me to go to their channel. I'm pretty much done with them but I do and I realise they made a video about me where they claim I was emotionally abusive.I continued to get messages from strangers telling me how awful a person I was and how they hoped I died through various means.So I sued my ex.It ruined them. I knew they were financially in a bad spot and they likely couldn't afford court fees but the case dragged.They made a video about not being able to afford court costs and such and how it was going to ruin them.After which a bunch of friends started telling me to just let it go and move on but I had sunk money into the case as well. It wasn't cheap for me either so I didn't just let it go.Eventually the judge ruled in my favor and I received a total of nothing from my ex......But it meant I could link to the result in the comments section of every video she tried to frame me as the bad guy because in our state, court proceedings are public record.Suddenly her viewership dropped and she blamed me for ruining her life.A bunch of my friends said I went too far and should've just taken the court win and left her alone.Was I the asshole?"
84,Not the A-hole,Aita: For giving my deceased son's college fund to his best friend instead of my nephew?,31467,jrrmdy,3384,"This has been causing a conflict with my entire family. And they think that I'm being selfish and unreasonable. Let me explain first.I M39 lost my son in 2019 due to a chronic heart condition. He was 15 years old. It was devastating and I just couldn't take it especially when my family did little to nothing to support me during these difficult times. They didn't bring my son meals when he was at the hospital. They didn't let me go home and rest even for a few hours. They didn't take care of other things while I had a lot to deal with I wasn't offered any help just words. They'd just talk but do nothing.Despite the struggle. I've created an account for my son's college fund and kept putting whatever I could get at the time and me and my son would talk about that a lot. He was depressed but always believed that he was going to get better and continue his education and attend college.I started saving money To keep him motivated and to make him feel like he could be like any other kid with hopes for a good future. He had a very close friend that's about the same age as him. They were friends for 5 years, and I can't express how his presence in my son's life helped him through the worst days, sometimes his friend would spend the night with us and try to get my son to do activities and lighten up his mood all the time. To be frank his friend was closer to him than his own family.He never stopped visiting and asking how I'm doing after my son's death. He'd show me handmade projects he made for my son and as a way to remember him and we'd sometimes just sit and talk together or cry together. Last week. While I was with my family my sister asked me what I was going to do with my son's college money. I didn't wanna mention this but since she asked I told her that I will be giving the money to my son's friend. She barely even recognized his friend and was confused and said that my nephew deserves this money since he's family. My mom agreed that I wasn't thinking straight and that I should help the people close to me-family and that my nephew has a right to go to college and I was wrong for giving this ""opportunity"" away to someone else.I didn't know what to say they kept pointing out that I was making a mistake and how my nephew will resent me if he finds out. Thing is my nephew wasn't close to my son I don't even know why he'd be bothered. My sister went on about not being able to afford my nephew's college I told her this was my decision and I felt more comfortable that way. She started lashing out, constantly texting me constantly wanting to talk to me and ending up arguing. When I snapped she had my mom calling me basically guilttripping me and telling me I'm wrong and that I needed to think about this.It's just too much pressure and I'm feeling lost and unable to figure out how to deal with this."
85,Not the A-hole,AITA for throwing out my mom after she threw out my weed?,31399,hm9j4o,2198,"Throwaway in case someone I know sees this, don't want them to know my main reddit account.So I am a 30 year old man. I'm single and live alone in a house that I own. A few months ago you know what happened and my mom lost her job. So I decided to let her stay with me.I have a medical marijuana card and smoke every day. I knew my mom disliked weed so I warned her before she moved in that I would be smoking weed daily and would not stop for her. She agreed, and only asked that I smoke outside. Which I thought was a relatively reasonable request; weed has a strong smell and many people don't like it.At first this worked out fine at first. But she started making remarks about how I should quit, ect. I mostly just ignored them/brushed them off. Then it evolved to her demanding that I quit. As if I were still  a child she could issue orders to. I refused and told her that she can move out if she doesn't like it. She started crying and saying that I don't love her, I have a problem, ect. The next day, I come home from work to find her waiting for me. She explained that she had flushed my weed (a little less than an ounce) for my own good. And then demanded that I go to treatment. Well, predictably, I was furious. And not even really about not having the weed anymore. It is pretty cheap (I usually buy ounces for $125) and I can easily get more. It was about her total lack of respect for me. I'm an adult, own my own house, have a good job, and have approval from the state to legally purchase and possess marijuana.  So someone I'm doing a huge favor for demanding that I stop and throwing out my stuff when I refused is extremely outrageous to me. No matter if she pushed me out of her vagina 30 years ago.Anyway, we argued about this for a while and it became clear to me that she was not sorry at all and that she would probably do it again. So I told her she can't live with me anymore. I gave a month, but she has already packed all her shit and drove to my brothers house a couple hours away. She obviously thinks I'm a huge asshole. So does my brother. But I think that's mostly because she is his problem now."
86,Not the A-hole,AITA for banning my husband’s female friend from our house?,31306,hkh0dd,2289,"Throwaway account, English is not my first language, I’m on mobile - I apologise. I (27F) have been married with my husband (M32) for three years and haven been dating for a little over 5. My husband has this friend (F31) ‘Mary’. They’ve known each other since they were in high school and she’s considered ‘one of the boys’, if you may. That basically means she’s always invited to all the fishing trips and stuff, which I don’t mind at all, I trust my husband. Well, my problems with Mary started when she first found out I’m half Romanian. It started kinda innocently, with her asking me to say certain words, teach her some insults etc which didn’t necessarily bother me, but it usually put me on the spot whenever we were out with my husband’s group of friends. It only escalated to her googling stuff about Romania and asking me ‘are you a vampire? do you bite your husband by the neck?’ to ‘are you a gypsy? I bet you’ve got some of that gypsy blood in you’ (which is just blatantly racist)Last week, me and my husband organised a mini BBQ with our friends and Mary was invited by my husband despite me telling him she makes me uncomfortable. He said he had talked to her about her remarks and she’s been understanding so it’s unlikely she’ll say something this time.It was midnight and there were about 4 of us left and I accidentally spilled some red wine on Mary’s jeans when I tripped over a carpet. All hell broke loose. Mary started saying that I’m a witch and I’m trying to ruin her life and this whole thing is part of my ritual and I’m just a ‘immigrant gypsy trying to ruin my husband’s life’ and I’ve poisoned my husband against her. I started crying and profusely apologising. When she wouldn’t drop it, I kicked her out and banned her from ever coming to my house again. AITA for doing this? My husband insists that Mary was just drunk and talking nonsense and he would talk to her. He also told me I’m way too sensitive about my heritage and I’m an a-hole for banning her. Mary has since given me a half hearted apology but I’m still not ok with her.EDIT: I guess this is the update some of you wanted. Sorry I’m still a mess and idk how coherent I am. We’ve talked. He admitted to being in and out of an affair with Mary in the first 2y of our relationship and she wanted to win him back I guess. I called my mom to come help me pack some stuff and im out. Thats it. Mary can have him I’ve been gaslit for years and it took a reddit post to realise. Oh the irony. thank you reddit.EDIT2 and probably the last one for a period of time: A lot of people seemed suspicious of Mary and my husband’s friendship/relationship etc and have asked if I ever suspected anything. No, I didn’t. Me and my husband had (or I thought we had) a very strong relationship, based on communication and honesty (guess it only applied to me). Also, Mary is very close with all the boys in the said friendship group. The other wives raised concerns in the past but they’ve all been shut down by the boys in the group or by Mary herself. I guess I always respected their friendship group because they were very close for so long and it felt unfair to change that because of me. As far as I’m aware, the other wives feel the same - plus Mary has been in a LD relationship for about 2 years and always claimed she’s focusing on her career, she’s too busy etc so none of us ever saw her as a potential threat. But now it just makes me think there could be more to this story. But I’m tired, as of right now, I am just exhausted. My Romanian witch blood won’t let me live until I find out the whole truth but I need time.Thank you to everyone who took the time to reply to my post, message me (even the ones that insulted me further - it was semi-funny) and thank you for the awards! I’m sending virtual hugs to all of you! Aveți grijă de voi!"
87,Not the A-hole,"AITA for disowning my brother when he came out as gay, because of how he's treating his wife?",31246,ggmc1h,1775,"I (21f) have a brother (28) who came out as gay last month. He has been married to my best friend's big sister (24) for four years, they have 2yo twin daughters together. I'm really close with her, so I've been trying to stay neutral in what has become a messy separation. My brother told his wife he's gay by sitting her down, and saying he had been sleeping with two different men for about six months. He said he is now sure that he feels romantic feelings for men, and also told her he has been sleeping with random men from Grindr for over a year behind her back. She obviously freaked out, asked him how he could do this, why didn't he tell her when he started having the feelings, etc. He said that he's always thought he was gay but he didn't want to come out because it might affect his career. She asked him what about the effect on her life? She is now a single mother to two toddlers. He was essentially very angry that she wasn't supportive of this, so he kicked her out of the house, with the kids. After she eventually found a place to stay, my brother moved in one of the men he has been having an affair with. Since then, he has had very little contact with the kids, as in speaking to them on the phone once a week maybe. He has expressed that he still doesn't want to be public about coming out, so he posted on Facebook that he has separated from his wife because they aren't in love anymore and hinted SHE was the unfaithful one (posting things like 'yeah, seems like someone in this relationship wasn't satisfied with just one man') and is basically being a dick.I told him a couple weeks ago that he's a fucking asshole and I don't want to be involved with him anymore because I think it's disgusting that he's treated his wife like this. I told him I get that you have to come out in your own time, but you don't need to kick her out, ignore your kids and berate her, and you don't need to make comments that people will assume mean she was being unfaithful (he said this was a joke about him having two partners now? still fucked up). He said I'm being a homophobic asshole, and that I don't know how hard it is to come out. He said that if I don't accept him, I'm a bigot. He made mistakes and what not. I said maybe I will forgive him if he improves his behaviour to his wife, and he said he resents her for keeping him from sleeping with men for years. I gave up at this point. My sisters (17&24) both think I'm being homophobic, my mom agrees with me. AITA?"

Anyways, a couple days ago, I got my period. It came early and I had ran out of pads. I couldn’t leave to buy some because I bleed pretty heavily and I would’ve bled through my pants. So I asked my boyfriend if he could buy pads for me from the drugstore, because it was late. He immediately said no. I was shocked because I wasn’t really expecting that. I asked him why. He said that he didn’t want the cashier to see him buying pads. At this point I started laughing because that was hilarious. He wasn’t joking though. He just glared at me. I told him that the cashier would obviously know it wasn’t for him. Plus, the cashier would definitely not care what he was buying. He still refused. I told him that he could go to the self checkout machine if he was so insecure, but he said that he didn’t want anyone to see him with the pads because they’d think he was a “tr***y”. I told him that he was childish, and that his masculinity was really fragile if he couldn’t even buy pads for his own girlfriend. He got mad and went out. I had to bunch up toilet paper as a makeshift pad, wear black pants and a long cardigan and go buy the pads myself. My boyfriend has been ignoring me ever since. I’ve been thinking that maybe I might’ve pushed it too far.So AITA for telling my boyfriend that his masculinity was fragile after he refused to buy pads for me?*Edit*: *Wow, thank you for all your replies! I’m definitely going to have a serious talk with my boyfriend in the morning about this and we’ll see how it goes***UPDATE**: First off, thank you for all your awards, replies and stories, they all mean so much to me. I confronted my boyfriend an hour ago. We sat down together and I told him that I didn’t like how he acted about buying pads for me. He said that he didn’t feel like he had to, and that I could’ve “held it in” and drove to the drugstore to get the pads myself. I told him that you can’t “hold in” menstrual blood, but he insisted that I could’ve done it for a few minutes and that it wouldn’t be a big deal. We went back and forth over this so I just dropped it. I asked him (like most of you mentioned) what would happen when we have kids and he’d have to take care of me and buy me nipple cream, take me to the washroom, etc. He said that I would not need those things because I should be able to do them on my own after giving birth. He said that there wasn’t anything hard about using the bathroom and the only reason I’d need help is if I was a “cripple”. Then I asked him about the tr***y comment. He said that he didn’t understand why people would want to change the gender they were born in. That basically cemented everything for me. I felt completely betrayed and humiliated. I can’t believe I spent two years of my life with a guy who holds these views, and I can’t believe I was too oblivious to it. I just feel so dumb. I told him that we need to break up. He cussed at me and told me that I was exaggerating and that I was being a bitch. I told him that I would send him my half of this month’s rent (we live together but it was his appartement so we would split the bill). Then I packed my bags and drove to my parents house without saying another word. I’m gonna be staying with my parents until I sort myself out. I’m feeling really down right now, because I really did love him, but I also feel relieved. Again, thank you all for helping me out, and sending me encouraging messages. I appreciate it all."
89,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling the principal that his punishment was dumb and taking my daughter out for a fun day instead,31095,ipw5v4,1882,"This happened last year before the world fell apart, just asking out of boredom.My daughter was in second grade. She was in class and suddenly felt like she was going to vomit so she tried to run to the bathroom. She didn’t make it and vomited in the hallway. However she was sent to the office for running out of class without permission. The principal called me about this and I had to come in. He told me that she was being punished and was losing her privileges to go on the field trip the next week. I told him that was insane considering she did it because she was trying to keep from making a mess and she’s 7! She made a snap judgement that I think most people would make. On top of that, they sent her to the principal instead of the nurse. He refused to change the decision so I took my daughter out of school for the last 2 days of the week. Since she was missing the field trip I wanted her to have as much fun as possible so we went to an amusement park, the movies, and to paint pottery. She told her father about this during his visitation time and he got very angry at me for undermining the principal. AITA?"
90,Not the A-hole,AITA for making fun of a girl for her dad's 9/11 death?,31046,iqyn74,946,"I go to college in New York state. I am Muslim. I was very young when 9/11 happened, as were the rest of the people in my year.There's a girl in one of my classes who's father was in the World Trade Center. He died. Of course, this is very sad, and I pity the man, but not her. She's extremely racist. She hates everyone who isn't white or east asian. But she especially hates Muslims due to her father's passing. So of course, we don't talk.But today, September 11, was the day she exploded. I was wearing a hijab. She told me I should take it off out of respect for the victims and that it was the equivalent of a hat. I said no. She said that ""you Muslims did this, you need to take off the hijab to show respect."" I obviously told her no. Then she went on a very long Islamophobic rant that I can't entirely recall because this was hours ago. But I remember she concluded by saying that Islam took away her father, so she wants to take away Islam. (I'm still confused as to what she meant.)She made a few comments towards me, and I went on my phone to de escalate. She made more comments, I kept ignoring her. But then she said ""Yeah, you're not responding because you know I'm right"". I don't know why that set me off, but it did. I told her ""No, I'm just busy texting my DAD"". She left the room in tears. My classmates are saying that she was in the wrong, but what I said was unnecessarily cruel. Now, I don't think I'm TA, bc she started it, all I did was finish it.So, reddit, AITA??Yes, I am aware I have spelling mistakes. I speak Arabic at home.EDIT: For everyone wondering, the professor was out of the room. He'd already given us our lecture."
91,Not the A-hole,AITA for being honest about how I was bullied and how the teachers at my school did nothing about it while being interviewed by a current student?,31046,lb4bjq,2133,"I’m an author of mild success. I’m not incredibly popular, but my books sell enough. About 3 months ago, someone from my old high school reached out to see if a student could interview me.I responded that my time at the school wasn’t the happiest, but I would give the student responses relating to my career. We had a great chat. She started asking questions about my time at the school, but I redirected. She caught on to what I was doing and asked “I’m sensing that you’re hesitant to talk about your time at (school). Is that true?”I said let’s focus on the story, and she was like “Actually this could be a better story.”So I said y’know what, sure. Whatever. I don’t owe the school anything, I’m not being paid, and even though it’s been a long time and I’ve grown from what happened, it’s still worth talking about. I mentioned a few names in specific, and how I’d tried to ask for help and was blown off by everyone. Teachers at my school very strongly favored the girls in sports teams, and would often be buddy buddy with them and their parents.I mentioned a teacher who openly mocked the way I dressed, my lack of athleticism, etc. I brought up the time that a group of girls followed me around the school mooing at me and when I broke down crying because they wouldn’t stop and tried to tell a teacher, the teacher called me “Moolly” for the rest of the year and when I yelled “MY NAME IS MOLLY. *MOLLY”* she had me suspended for a week.She ended up publishing the whole interview. Nothing exactly went “viral” but there were posts on FB with a ton of comments and it caused some commotion in that community.A few weeks later, I was contacted by a school official who chastised me for bringing up old wounds and trying to paint veteran teachers as bad people when they were going through difficult times already. The teacher responsible for the “Moolly” incident had a local lifetime teaching award taken away from her after it all came out, so was it really worth it, and maybe did I remember things wrong?Finally, a handful of my old classmates (many of them stuck around town) found me and I was barraged with a ton of messages telling me that I’m ruining the reputation of the school and of several prominent community members, it was X years ago so why can’t I just get over it, etc. Some of them obviously haven’t changed.It was a long time ago, yes. I don’t know how I really feel about how this all went down though. I know times are tough for teachers right now. I didn’t set out to hurt anyone, I was just telling my truth. AITA?**Edited:** So... I didn't expect this to be so overwhelmingly in favor of NTA. I wasn't looking for validation, but wow. Some of you are sending me heartbreaking stories of bullying and being ignored or gaslit, and I am so sorry. Thank you all for the responses. If the Mods want to take this down because of validation or whatever, please do. I have my answer. "
92,Not the A-hole,AITA for selling my daughter's car after discovering her texting & driving?,30966,cb6xz4,6597,"When my daughter was 14, wife and I decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. There would be a ""contract"" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. The stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. We made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. We got the car, a 2012 Honda Civic. She has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. In a few months she will be off to college. Everything was going swimmingly. Until someone on that NextDoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. And lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. Once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. I was livid. My wife was the one who showed it to me. We found out there were more instances (from her Instagram Stories) and we decided... no.Wife and I up and sold the car. We didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. It's so unfair, I didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am I supposed to get to work, what about when I go to college? Well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. She tried to play the ""how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?"" card and I said ""Well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?"" and she just up and screamed. This has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. Her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. They've threatened that THEY will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. The car is already sold, so there's no going back. I think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. In terms of her going to college? Well, she made that choice. She had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price. So AITA?"
93,Not the A-hole,AITA for getting mad at my sister for not wanting me shirtless at her pool?,30929,hppclc,759,"My sister and her husband invited me over to their pool today for a little BBQ. I assumed it would just be me, my sister, her husband, my nephews, and my parents. But turns out they also invited her husband’s side of the family. When it was time to get in the pool, I changed into my swim trunks and removed my shirt. But my sister stopped me before I came out their house and asked to keep my shirt on because of my scars. She was referring to the scars from when I had my top (chest) surgery. I’m a trans guy. Had started transitioning 8 yrs ago and my surgery was 4 years ago. My scars have already faded and they’re pretty well hidden under my pecs. You’d have to look really close to even notice. I’ve been to their pool many times and she’s never said anything before so I was surprised. Every other guy including my dad were all shirtless in the pool. When I asked what the prob was with my scars she said she was uncomfortable with her in laws knowing I’m trans. My feelings were hurt but I was mainly pissed. She said she didn’t want her in laws to look at her differently if they found out about me. She told me not to make a big deal and to go with it. When she left, I went back inside to change because i wasn’t gonna go in the pool with a shirt on. I only had the one I came wearing because I didn’t expect her to ask me this. My mood was soured after that and I didn’t wanna be around her so I decided to leave. When I said bye to everyone they were all confused since I was only there less than an hour. My dad pulled me aside and asked why I was leaving early. I told him to ask my sister and left. An hour later my sister called me upset because she and my dad got into a fight. My parents were furious about what she told me and they ended up leaving early too. Now she’s angry at me for ruining the bbq and said I didn’t have to cause all this drama if I only did what she asked.What she said hurt me and I was no longer in a mood to be around her or anyone else, but I didn’t mean for all that to happen. Am I the asshole for getting mad at her and basically ruining their day?"
94,Not the A-hole,Aita for giving a woman a taste of her own behavior,30880,aphmhd,783,"I'm sitting at the airport and this older lady sat down right next to me and took her iPad out and starts watching a show quite loud. To me this is a foul in public however I just ignored it and put my earbuds in. After a while I made a phone call using my earbuds. Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.I was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. She said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. I said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. I have never seen someone storm off so mad. Quick edit. I turned the music video off almost immediately after she left. "
95,Not the A-hole,AITA for banning my roommate’s girlfriend after she kept insisting I was hitting on her?,30805,kwcbq0,1671,"I (24F) am a lesbian living with my good friend (25M). I own the apartment; I’m renting out the extra room to him.A little over a month ago, he met a girl online, and they started dating. She is now at our place constantly. I’ll be honest, I’ve never really liked her. She was incredibly standoffish and rude to me from the beginning. I eventually learned it was because she thought I had a thing for my roommate. Even after he told her I was gay, apparently her only argument was, “she doesn’t look gay.”A few weeks ago, we were all drinking and hanging out at our place with a few close friends. I tried to mend fences by pulling the GF aside and telling her that I really am gay, I have no interest in stealing her boyfriend, and I hope we can be friends.She seemed to take this very well, and was OVERLY friendly with me the whole rest of the night. I thought she was just trying to make up for being so cruel at first.The next day, my roommate asked if we could talk. He said his GF feels uncomfortable around me after I “drunkenly hit on her.” Wuuut. I was not even remotely close to being drunk. Also, I am negatively attracted to her. Like, way less than zero. I find her insanely annoying.I tried to explain that I was trying to be nice, as I knew she didn’t particularly like me. I wanted to be civil if she was going to be around often. My roommate seemed skeptical, but he ultimately took my word for it and chalked it up to a miscommunication.Fast forward a week or so, the friend group is hanging out at our place again. The GF comes over, of course. I’m cordial to her, but I try to keep my distance so another “miscommunication” doesn’t happen.Towards the end of the night, one of our other friends comes up to me like, “Dude, what is going on? GF keeps telling everyone you’ve been checking her out and hitting on her all night?”Again, I was stunned. And at this point, incredibly pissed off. I went right up to the GF in front of everyone, and said, “What the hell’s going on? Why are you spewing lies about me hitting on you to all my friends?”She just stared at me, unable to respond. I continued, “Just because I’m gay does not mean I’m into you. Trust me, I am not the LEAST bit interested in you.”She started sobbing that I was attacking her for no reason, calling her out, making her super uncomfortable again, etc. I told her to get the hell out, and that she was no longer welcome here for making ME feel uncomfortable in my own apartment. Her and my roommate left.Needless to say, my roommate is super pissed at me. He hasn’t been back to our place since, but I’ve gotten some angry texts. I’m standing my ground that she is not welcome here anymore, but he is free to stay or move out as he pleases.Most of our friends are on my side. I guess I could’ve been easier on her, but I am just so over it.Edit: Wow! I woke up to tons of notifications. Thanks everyone, and thanks for the awards!Edit 2: I guess I should’ve added that where I live, the mask/stay-at-home mandates have been lifted for awhile. That being said, my friends and I still choose to wear masks, and be extremely careful. We do not go out to bars, even though they are fully open. I occasionally have a few close friends over, whom I trust to also be careful. No parties - I don’t get how anyone landed on that. Hope this clears things up."
96,Not the A-hole,"AITA for calling my brother an “insecure, testicle grabbing, chauvinist man-baby” over his comments about my wife’s makeup?",30798,l05log,1724,"That’s the actual quote. I’m still pissed as hell but maybe I went too far here. My brother and I are both late 30s. We get along fine most of the time, but my brother doesn’t do well in a lot of social situations. He says things that are inappropriate, gets overly opinionated, yells a lot etc.  He just doesn’t seem to understand tact or when to let things go in a casual conversation. Our wives are best friends. They talk almost everyday on FaceTime. My wife is an ex model/actress (local) and very good with makeup.  She’s in her mid 30’s, we have 3 kids and she doesn’t wear much makeup anymore - but she got some as a gift for Christmas and decided she wanted to get more. Apparently she’s been buying cheap stuff and she wanted to splurge on some good shit. Anyway, she’s been testing it all out over the last month, buying more here and there and doing these crazy eyeshadow things - honestly I don’t know what I’m talking about. She looks great all the time. She’s gorgeous without makeup. She’s really talented with it though and she’s having a lot of fun. I tease her a little since she works from home and she’s wearing pajamas but her makeup looks like she’s at a nightclub. I think it’s cute and funny. My brother thinks she’s doing it because she’s cheating or she wants to cheat. He called me this morning to say he’s concerned because he’s seen her on FaceTime and he’s decided she must be posting pictures or sending pics to some dude or multiple dudes. I tried to blow it off and explain that it wasn’t that way, but he got more aggressive about it so I ended up yelling at him and shouting the insecure testicle man baby thing. He’s being ridiculous and needs to mind his own business. But I think I might be the asshole for blowing up and name calling when he’s probably well intentioned. I want to add too (my mom and brother both asked, maybe other people will):  No, I haven’t asked my wife why she’s recently starting wearing more makeup and I’m not going to because I think asking is fucking rude. She’s spending her money on stuff for her face and it’s a creative hobby. I’m not going to be the dick that ruins someone’s creative outlet by asking them to justify it or by insinuating there’s a sinister motive behind it. It makes her happy so I assume that’s why she’s doing it. Asking why is dumb and insulting in my opinion."

After I harvest, I make lots of strawberry jelly to give to my family, friends, and neighbors. I donate the leftovers to my local food bank.Lately I've had a big problem with all the neighborhood kids coming in my yard and stealing my strawberries. The last time I caught them I threatened them with the police because they was so reckless they smashed over 50 of my plants.I caught them in my yard again this afternoon, instead of calling the police I grabbed my garden hose and sprayed them while chasing them out of my yard. I just had a group of angry parents come to my house complaining about my actions. Absolutely none of them was willing to apologize for their children's actions. One parent in particular is threatening to sue me, because her son's iPhone 10 was ruined with water. I told her that was her problem for letting her eight-year-old son have a $1,000 phone. Then I threatened to spray them with my hose if they didn't get off of my property."
98,Not the A-hole,AITA for having a wedding and not disclosing we were already legally married?,30743,d9m02m,3271,"About two months ago, my husband and I got “married” in a beautiful ceremony. It was SO MUCH FUN. We went on a honeymoon after. The price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it’s their only daughter’s wedding. As a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or I could afford! My husband and I paid the rest — his family did not contribute (which is fine!). The wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. About a year and a half ago, I was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). I had recently graduated from school and didn’t have health insurance. My husband and I decided to get married so I could join his health insurance. It was a quick Justice of the Peace ceremony. We were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. A few months after that, he “proposed” (something I didn’t see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. Very few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. We weren’t trying to be deceptive. However, part of it was that I wasn’t comfortable revealing my health issues. My husband respected this. My parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. His mom (I’ll call her Carol) and I aren’t close. She’s fine enough in low doses, but...We’re currently in the process of moving. This past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. As we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must’ve slipped out. Carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. And then she noticed the date. Carol lost it. She insisted we lied to everyone. She said our wedding ceremony was just a “gift grab” (our wedding website stated that someone’s presence was gift enough— we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). Carol went and called her twin sister, my husband’s aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. She said we were sneaky and deceptive. She is saying she may want her gift back—something we are fine with giving her. For me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so I could get insurance. A means to an end. Our wedding date is what we will celebrate. Are we assholes for not being more upfront? I’ve been really upset and confused and waffle back and forth. My husband insists we are not assholes."

This acc is just for privacy reasons-I always had good grades in high-school, was home on time, cleaned the house etc. I never had problems with my parents before this. -I went to med school, still living with parents when I was 20, I dated someone who was 23-Dad was against this because be does not believe in dating people far older than you (so like don't date far from your own age)  and says I cannot date J. -Argument breaks out, Dad says it's his house so either I agree or I move out. I say it's not fair as J has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. Dad kicks me out. Mom agrees with his decision. Little bro was only 14 at the time. -I moved with J, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (I went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro-Years later, me and J (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (Like really small but I'm happy with it). I ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. I let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  He came a few times. -Today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when I was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. I said never and that I wasn't going to forgive them. Bro says I'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, I say that's bullshit because Dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. Bro says I should at least let Mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. I say Mom was able to do something but didn't,but that Bro's situation was different because he was only 15. Bro is upset because he says Mom and Dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that I am dragging this entire situation. I told him that if he thinks I'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. He's angry and says that I need to move on and that I shouldn't be withholding them from seeing THEIR grandchild. I say that THEY disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist. AITA? I don't hate my bro and I (kinda)  get what he is saying, but I just have a resentment for my parents. It's not like I had a baby just to put it against them,  but my lil bro thinks I'm going go die on a hill with them for something done several years ago and it's petty. I'm curious on what reddit thinks. I want a relationship with my bro, just not my mom and dad"
100,Not the A-hole,AITA for having my daughter write a 'morbid' school family tree project?,30627,jxq6yb,2203,"My biological family is dead. I was raised in foster care, and so my friends are my family. I met my late husband in college. He was just raised by his mother, who had abandoned him and later died (no adoptive family). As an adult, I've looked into both trees and our biological ancestors are, to put it mildly, really dangerous people and/or dead. My late husband and older son died in a car crash.My daughter is in kindergarten and she, more accurately me, was supposed to do a family tree project for school. I tried speaking to her teacher that this was not going to be a Pollyanna report, but she is one of those people that can't comprehend that sometimes family is a dark subject, and insisted that it needed to be biological. So, I did it.Some of them, like her father and my son, I have actual information for aside from that they're dead. But for most of my family and her paternal family, I literally only have birth date, death date, when they would have had their kids, and cemetery information, unless they were cremated.It was supposed to have 10 pictures, but most of the pictures I have of any ancestors are just headstones. I made a trip when my husband and I first married to take pictures of the headstones, so I included those in there. I only have 3 pictures total of my biological family, and most of them are group shots where I could only label maybe 3 people. I don't have any pictures of my late husband's family from before me and my kids, but I put some of the old ones in there too.So while the other kids had long family trees, my daughter was basically introducing the concept of death to her kindergarten class. Now I'm getting slammed with calls from other parents, the teacher, and the principal. They're appalled that I allowed such a ""morbid"" report and are saying I traumatized their children. I don't think I did anything wrong. They wanted a report on her biological ancestors, I gave it, and kept it G-rated. I just didn't lie that people were alive when they weren't. I don't raise her to think that death is taboo or something to be ashamed of anyway. Death is part of life. Most of her/my family is dead, so talking about family just means talking about death, and it's just something you have to accept. AITA?"

In one split second, the happy family I knew was gone, and I went through the darkest time in my life.My parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). She never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship I wanted to have with him. I eventually forgave my dad mostly because I was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. I talk to him but I want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister.My mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which I now own and operate.

He was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up.This year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. The bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment.The thing is, I don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. Though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when I think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and I have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. I'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. They are her parents after all. The only thing tying me to her is my father saying ""She is your sister"" and ""If she dies because she didn't get the treatment she needs, would you be able to sleep at night?""AITA?"
102,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling my grandma by wrong name until she gets my name right?,30478,jlzj6u,2953,"This has going on since forever so decided to do something. I’m (16m) half Mexican from my dad’s side and my mom’s side is Scottish. Ngl most of my mom’s family is high key racist and is been problems sometimes growing up. My grandma on my mom’s side never liked my dad and was happy after they divorced when I was 7.My names Emiliano and my grandma always complained how hard she tried to change my parents minds and it’s a shame I got stuck with it. I’m actually proud of it. My dad told me about the revolutionary I was named after and their history.But literally my entire life my grandma refuses to say it. She says it’s “too many syllables” (i got a cousin named Alexandria and they say the whole name) and always came up with her own names. She says Leo or once tried to get everyone to call me “Elliot” as a nickname for a while. Obvious my moms family was for it but my dad refused that cause it’s not my name. Is always the same thing when I see them. She’ll call me Leo or whatever. Even when I correct her she says it’s not a big deal an keeps calling wrong name. I told my mom I don’t like it but she always say I’m just not gonna change her mind and no point in fighting it.So I decided if she not gonna wanna call me by my actual name in not gonna call her grandma or say her right name. Is stupid I know but it’s bothering me more that she don’t care and all my other cousins she says their names fine, no nicknames. Her name is Susan so I decided to call her Sandy.  Tbh I was scared to say it but that look on her face was worth it lmao. It wasn’t surprise Pikachu face but it was close. She said that is not how I address her and it’s “grandma”. I told her nah I’mma call her sandy from now until she says my actual name.It got awkward. My mom was serious and my gma got super red in the face. She started ranting about me being a fucking disrespectful child and this is all my dad influencing me again. My mom told me I need to apologize immediately but idk what gave me the balls to not do it. We ended up leaving there house early and my mom didn’t talk to me until we got home. She say what I did was outta line and I don’t disrespect my elders ever. She wants me to apologize and I’m grounded until I do. Haven’t talked to my dad yet about this since it just happened but I wanted to ask if it was being an asshole or was it okay for this situation to “insult my grandmother” ?"
103,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to visit my dad after my room was converted to an office/bedroom?,30415,e52dls,3307,"I used to visit my dad most weekends and all of summer.He recently got remarried to someone I actually have a decent relationship with. I also have two stepbrothers who are younger and who I don't really interact with.My dad has a four bedroom house. So all the kids have a bedroom.When I went to visit last month, I was ""surprised"" with a renovated room. And by renovated I mean it was converted to an office with a couch that pulls out to a bed. It did look nice I suppose.Apparently my stepmother works from home and needed an office.I didn't cry or throw a tantrum. I slept in the room that weekend and have refused to stay the night since.I was really hurt and felt like I didn't matter. My mom tried to convince me to go back but gave up after I told her I was old enough to decide.My dad is stressing out and has apologized and said he'll change the room back but honestly, I'm done. This was the final thing that sealed the deal for me. I told him that as well. I told him I'll come for day visits and we can have dinners but I won't be staying overnight anymore.Was I the asshole? He did cry and I feel really shitty about it.Edit: I'm going to be 15 in a few months"
104,Not the A-hole,AITA for correcting my daughter’s teacher about her name?,30382,go5wwj,4064,"My 7 year old daughter’s doing virtual school in our living room recently. I heard her teacher address a girl named Kelly a few times, which stuck out to me because my daughter’s class is only about 15 kids and I know them all by this point in the year. A couple times more and I realized she was calling my daughter Kelly. My daughter’s name is Keeley, pronounced Kee-Lee. So after school was over I asked her if that had been happening all year in this teacher’s class and she said it had and it really annoyed her. I asked her why she hadn’t corrected the teacher if it annoyed her so much and she said she had repeatedly at the beginning of the year but the teacher kept calling her Kelly, so eventually she gave up on reminding her. I sent the teacher a quick email explaining the misunderstanding but got no response. This teacher teaches a special subject (think music, gym, art, or language), not just one grade level, so my daughter will be in her classes for the next several years, so we couldn’t just wait it out. And how moments like these are handled now will set the stage for how my kid deals with similar situations on her own in the working world. I encouraged my daughter to come to class early or stay late her again, thinking maybe she hadn’t heard or understood her last time, so a quiet one on one would be better.She got to the class early and she told her very politely that her name was “Keeley like really, instead of Kelly like jelly” and that people often get it confused so she just wanted to clarify.So class starts and sure enough she gets called Kelly again almost immediately. So there’s only so much self advocation a seven year old can be expected to do. I just walked over and said “Hi, this is *Keeley’s* Dad. Her’s name not Kelly. It’s Keeley. Hard E. Sorry for any confusion.” A few hours later I had an email in my inbox “inviting” my wife and I to a parent teacher conference with the vice principle. The long and short of the meeting ended up being the school feels that while the teacher probably should’ve learned her name, that the real problem is she feels I challenged her authority by correcting her in class and that the names were “similar enough” for it to “not have warranted such drastic action.”That surprised me. I couldn’t believe a meeting was necessary, let alone that it cast blame on us. I can’t tell if I’m being that annoying “my kid matters most” parent that my grandmother the schoolteacher always complained about or if the teacher should just learn her damn name because that’s a basic part of her job. AITA?"
105,Not the A-hole,AITA for medically tattooing my child under the recommendation of a doctor.,30342,k70qfu,2725,"Hear me out. I (31F) and my husband tried for 5 years to get pregnant. Testing eventually revealed I have eggs of fucking steel and without medical help I'll never get pregnant. So that's what we did. Gave our samples, one petri dish and 9 months later I have 2 beautiful fraternal twin boys. Jack and Adam (fake).Thing is Jake has a condition. Without going into detail, requires a shot once a week. Once he is older he can take pills. I went back to work and MIL offered to watch the babes (shes wonderful, I trust her 100%. They were 9months.. Now 16months) during this time she would give his injection as we had a schedule. 10am before snack and nap. Worked very well until a month ago when she gave the shot to the wrong kid. Now they may be fraternal but they look identical. I'll be honest my husband and I even mix them up sometimes. Everyone does. She immediately noticed her mistake called 911 and they were transferred to hospital. By the time I got there Adam had been given the reversal agent and they were both happily sipping on juice loving the attention. We went home the same night told to push fluids. He was never in danger. Its a very slow acting medication that, at worst, would have given him diarrhea in a few days. MIL was beside herself. I tried to ease her worry but she refused to babysit so to daycare they went. This daycare has a nurse cause some of the kids have medications so she new what to do but the worry of mixing up the kids was a valid concern (and they would NOT keep name tags on) Doctor recommended a medical tattoo. Explained they tattoo a freckle, no bigger then the end of a pencil eraser, on an area of skin that's easily seen while the child is under mild sedation similar to dental offices. Because of the area it usually fades in 2-3yrs but by then they should have developed more personal features and may not need it redone. So after discussion with my husband we did it. He has a 2mm brown freckle on his earlobe.  From entering the office to leaving it took 30 minutes. Never felt a thing.MIL lost her shit the second I mentioned a medical tattoo. I tried to explain but she just freaked out so I put both kids on the floor and told her to pick up Jack and find the tattoo. She picked up Adam So I handed her Jack and after 20 minutes still couldn't find it. Stripped him to his skivvies. I finally pointed it out and she went ""That's just a freckle""  I just said... ""My point exactly. Adam doesn't have a freckle there.. So that's how daycare can tell them apart""She's still pissed and ranting. Once I explain to others and they fail to find it they understand but they still think I went to far in tattooing my child and altering their body. I believe I took the necessary precautions recommended by the doctor and the tattoo will fade with sun exposure and as he grows. By the time he's 5 it probably won't even be visible or it'll just look like a faded freckle. So.. AITA?"
106,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I send my parents to jail?,30323,ic651e,2286,"My (29f) parents have always been in financial trouble, something that I have never been able to understand because they both have a really generous salary (more than three times my own). Because of these financial troubles, my auns, uncles, and grandma have had over the years to lend them money, we were evicted a couple of times (that I know), we have had the water, the electricity and the internet cut... Many things that over the years I admit have affected my emotional and mental health.All of this has made my relationship with my parents very difficult over the years, more when they would take advantage of me making me pay for many things with the money that I earned working during holidays to pay for college or making me call my grandma to ask her for money, all of it while my mum used to spend money whenever she could in purses or jewellery .In the moment I became an adult because they started to sign on the bills under my name without my permission mostly because their credit was so bad that the companies wouldn't allow them to sign with their own names. When I figured it out I asked them to stop but they just lied about it and I just let it go because I couldn't deal with it.Fast forward to the present, because of the 'rona situation, I was looking forward the money from my income tax return, because my salary has gone down so this money would have helped a lot. Instead of it, I received a letter from a courthouse saying that the money has been confiscated. I immediately phoned my mum and she said that she didn't know anything about it but she will fix it. Since I don't trust her at all I called the court myself and then they explained me that during the last year there has been a proccess against me by a company I owe money from unpaid bills. All the papers had been sent to my parents and they had sign and take them. The debt was not paid with the money from the tax income so part of my salary from now on will be confiscated too until is fully paid.So my parents stole my identity to contract a bill under my name, didn't pay for it and when the company claim that debt through lawyers and a judge they kept all the papers from me (which is also illegal) apparently waiting for all of it to be fixed by itself.My mother said that it was her right to put it under my name because I am her daughter and it is my duty to help with the family burdens. Since then, and after really nasty words from her side and my sister's (who says that I am ungrateful and selfish) I haven't spoken to them and I am in the middle of a global pandemic with my salary already low, paying for a debt that it is not mine.My friends and boyfriend say that I should talk with the police and stop all of this because otherwise they will keep doing it and I am afraid they will.So, WIBTA if I speak with the court even if it means that my parents (70 and 63) could go to jail?Edit: Answers to some questions [here]("
107,Not the A-hole,"AITA for expecting my boyfriend to replace all my socks, the exact same ones as I had before?",30300,kn4yux,4687,"This might seem silly. I (24F) like wearing cheerful socks, since my uniform is all white (currently working as an phlebotomist), it usually cheers up the patients too. I've spent a few years collecting strange socks, ones with sushi, pizza, corgis, cats, Nick Cage, etc. I think I had about 30 pairs. My boyfriend (29M) has always hated them, and thinks they're childish. So I agreed to only wear them to work, and never on dates or around his friends/family. I thought that was fair. On boxing day his parents came over for coffee and gifts (just the 4 of us, which is allowed where I live, and keeping a solid 3 meters apart). I accidentally put on a pair of 'childish' socks, and his mother made a comment about it. I explained that I wear them to work to cheer people up, and she liked that. My boyfriend didn't. The next day all my socks were gone, and the drawer was filled with plain black socks. I asked my boyfriend, and he told me he threw them away and purchased some more 'appropriate' socks, so I won't embarrass him in front of his parents again. I told him that that's insane, they were mine and he had no right to throw them away. Not to mention that I spend quite some time collecting them. So I made a list of the ones I remembered I had, and told him that I expect the same ones as a replacement. He told me that's completely unreasonable, and that it would take a lot of time/effort/money for him to find those specific pairs. I haven't changed my mind yet, they cost me a lot of time and effort to find too. I think he's being controlling, he thinks I'm being unreasonable and demanding. AITA?I think I might be an asshole for asking for the exact same pairs, I know that'll take a lot of effort to find.Edit: Thanks everyone for replying, I've realised that this might not be a 'normal' fight and am evaluating the relationship."
108,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I started calling my white coworkers by random 'white' names?,30175,c03hb1,5462,"I moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.'So the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, ""How do you pronounce that?"" It's Tina!I have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, ""Just for the record, my name is Tina!"" to lighthearted, ""Tina, like Tina Belcher!"" In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, ""Thanks Tiana!"" Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like:Chuck: Thanks, TianaTina: No problem, Chad!Jessica: Hi Tiara!Tina: Good morning, Jennifer!Would I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it.EDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things:A lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense!A lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.A lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!And finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over.EDIT #2:No, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or ""Tiara""No, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.No, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code!Yes, I correct them every time.No, it's not because I'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!Responding to this post saying, 'Okay Shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('Tiana' being the 'Shaniqua' in this instance). Several people have alarmingly said, 'Okay, Trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'Chad' is VERY WEIRD!"
109,Not the A-hole,AITA for laughing in my brother and SIL’s faces when they demanded to use my credit card?,30156,j7b7ew,2636,"So I am 22F. I don’t have much knowledge about finances and stuff as I still live at home as I’m at university. I do however pay my parents about £300 a month rent, I pay my own phone plan, buy material stuff I want or need, pay out for other services like for music or whatever and try to put as much as I can in savings whilst still keeping enough in my main account for day to day purchases. Currently, I am saving up for driving lessons and hope that if I pass decently, I can use some of my savings towards getting a car. I’m in my final year of uni so I’ll be done and able to work full time when all this happens. I also decided to get a credit card so I can learn how to manage credit wisely and build some up. My credit score is good for someone of my age and circumstance but obviously it’s nothing great in comparison for other stuff. I should point out that at most I only plan on using this card with a total adding up to £100. Ive stuck to that so far and only actually used it twice with these purchases only adding up to £80 and I paid it off quickly. I do not plan on exceeding my limit any time soon as I’ve heard far too many horror stories of people just using their credit card too much cos it was handy and getting into debt.The only people I disclosed this to was my dad as my mum has the tendency to blab to my brother and SIL (both 28.) She happened to overhear us talking one day and before I knew it, my brother and SIL got wind and asked me if they could use it. They both admitted they had debt spurned on by excessive credit card use and thought that since I basically had nothing owed on mine, it was “free money.” I told them quite politely that I was really uncomfortable with that idea and that I would owe the money and I can’t Magic up that kind of money. Things went quiet until a few days later they both turned up at the house. They were nice to start with but basically started demanding I let them use the card and they tried to manipulate by mother into guilting me into doing it. I got really angry and when my brother said I owe it to them because they used to babysit me up until a couple of years ago, I laughed in their faces and walked out.When I came home, I learnt they tried to manipulate my dad and he kicked them both out. My mother then tried and he told her to go too and she is currently staying with my brother and SIL. The only person on my side is my dad who tells me they’re all trying to take me for a ride and they’re trying to manipulate me cos I’m young and they think I’m vulnerable. My brother, SIL and mum on the other hand think it isn’t a big deal letting someone else use my card. It’s really messing with my head and I just want everyone to stop being in an argument. AITA?"
110,Not the A-hole,AITA for not sharing medical history before being pranked?,30126,gflupe,2055,"Heyo,I'm a schizophrenic.  Started when I was 22, and will last till I die. I'm active in schizophrenic communities, go to groups,  the works but I am fairly private about it to most people to include friends. It's fairly common for people to think I'm eccentric (comes with the turf) due to some of my habits. Those habits include not going to parties or other places with lots of people, suddenly deciding not to do something (I have to be protective not to do or go to certain things if I think a delusion might be coming on), saying the occasional odd quip, normal schizophrenic stuff.Some friends thought it would be funny to make it seem like  I might be going crazy as a group. They would individually wear something silly like a wizard hat or dinosaur costume (TRex blow up costume) to a group event or say something totally out of the ordinary and pretend like it was normal (Police like to track people like you, covid is just a way to microchip you, etc). These are very real scary thoughts to me. I would ask members of the group if they had heard concerns about these conspiracies or weird garb from the other members, but they all acted like they had hung out with that particular member that day and I hadn't been involved.I was really, really scared that this could have been a massive delusion morphing into a full psychosis so I preemptively checked myself into a hospital to stop myself from potentially hurting myself or diving further into the rabbit hole(common in schizophrenic community). I was so scared my medications stopped working. No one heard from me for a few days while I was in the hospital, and when I checked out I confided in one of them about what had happened. I got a really long apology explaining what had happened and I blew up at them. I have ignored attempts from the others trying to apologize and have no desire to talk with them again.AITA for not previously stating that I am schizophrenic?Edit- People have been asking saying to post the length of the prank. Around 3 weeks.Edit 2- Thank you for the awards and stuff, but I really want to highlight some of the messages I have gotten. I'm at around 150 messages and counting and am trying to respond to the ones where I can hopefully offer insight.Resources that I find helpful- r/schizophrenia For groups just google schizophrenia support groups in my area, something will pop up and when you actually get there someone will have a further list. You get what you put into groups. You don't have to talk your first couple of times. But no one will look at you with the batshit look if you say ""Reality check- is there a bird in the room or something in that regard"". That did happen once and the audible sigh of relief from 8 other people and the laughter that followed was hysterical. Medication helps so much. It's the difference between being able to go for a walk with my dog and staying in bed all day. But it takes time. So many people have asked what drug and dosage a loved on should go on. I cannot answer that. There are so many drugs out there and different dosages. I can tell you that you (probably) will not have a noticable difference in behavior in two weeks after trying a medication. You start small, and work your way up to a therapeutic effect (when it actually helps). It might take some time to actually get to feeling human again. Not every medication is meant for every person, but don't give up!"
111,Not the A-hole,"AITA for ""tricking"" my copycat sister to cut her hair?",29942,hwcqu8,2232,"I have a younger sister who looks exactly like me. I am 19 and she is 16, but people have been mistakening us as twins for some time because of how close we resemble each other. We have same height, same skin tone, similar voice even. She also has a habit of being a copycat, from way of dressing to hobbies, even piercings. I know, its cute if you look it from the outside, sisters dressing and looking so alike that they are spitting images of each other.Honestly though, it's annoying and creeps me out sometimes, like yeah, we are quite close too but why does she always happen to pick up everything I pick up??I have been asking her to stop that, but she always insist that she really just finds it suiting her liking that she just had to try it herself by getting similar, if not identical things that I have.One afternoon I was tidying up some costumes in my college showroom and found a rather cute brown and pink wig, looks like mushroom. I put it on, think it looks rather funny so I snapped a picture of it and posted in my Instagram. I received a text from my sister asking if I really cut my hair(I did not mention it was a wig). The AH part is - while I somewhat have a feeling that she MIGHT copy that too, I lied and replied yes, I want a change of style.I went home when weekends came and lo and behold - my sister emerged with the same silly brown and pink bob cut, except this one is her permanent hair. She was very surprised that I arrived with my hair still long, then realized that I lied to her. She was furious that she had to cut that silly hairstyle because she thought I had it, but truth be told, I never asked her to. She should have seen it in my picture that that hairstyle look super silly and yet she still tried to cut her hair that way.Our parents think that it was a really bad joke and wanted me to cut my hair too to make it up to her(I wonder why did they not stop her in the first place). While I feel sorry for her, I am somewhat glad that at least she won't be able to copy my hairstyle now with her hair so short so I am keeping my hair long."

I don't know how he has such a high turnover rate but I'm guessing it's to do with him being both rich and a raging narcissist. He invited me to get coffee and introduced me to his new fiancee. I knew he was going to do this because two of my brothers (there are 7 of us total, none have the same mother) said that they had just gotten coffee with dad and met the fiancee, then been invited to the wedding, and both had been given a plus one for their girlfriends of 8 and 10 months respectively.Dad told me to bring my ""partner"" when I came for coffee and I brought my (trans) boyfriend along. We have been together for 3 years. The fiancee seemed nice, wanting to know about me and my boyfriend and asking questions that sounded like she actually gave a shit. Dad gets all the details of the engagement/wedding out of the way and then asks me, and only me, if I'll be there.I notice that he was talking to just me, not my boyfriend, so I say ""*we* will check if *we're* free"".Dad replies that ""this is family only""I reply, ""I just assumed, seeing as how the other siblings got plus ones""Dad says ""that's different. Are you coming?""I say ""we'll catch the next one"".Dad's fiancee becomes visibly upset and they leave. Dad texts me after that if I can be civil on the day then I can still come alone.I felt like I had to stick up for my boyfriend because this was definitely due to him being transgender, and he thanked me at the time but told me that I should probably still go, but after reporting back to my siblings to say what had happened I got mixed responses. The overall opinion was that while I absolutely should stick up for my boyfriend this was some hill to die on and I managed to catch the actually nice fiancee in the crossfire and upset dad, too.AITA?Info: I am a woman. My boyfriend is trans FTM. Despite both of us being straight, dad thinks of us as lesbians due to my boyfriend's biology. Of me and my siblings, 3 were within wedlock and the other 4 (including me) were extramarital: 3 affairs, 1 long term girlfriend. The fiancee knows she's #5 and dad gives the same story about how he was tricked into marrying golddiggers by accident and didn't know until too late and the affairs all happened as the relationships were breaking down."
113,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling a woman who lives in my complex that yes having her husband check me out turns me on?,29777,fvx43x,1573,"Okay, hear me out. I live in a complex that is built in a circle so its like a track. A lot of people use it to run, walk, etc. I've always used it to run/walk as well. I live in Florida so I usually wear leggings and a sports bra or a tank top. I literally only wear it because it's insanely hot here.This woman always gave me dirty looks when I'd walk by her apartment (she'd be sitting on her porch.) There are a few maintenance guys (not sure if that is the correct title for them - but that is what everyone calls them) that walk and ride around on golf carts throughout the day. I soon realized that the dirty look woman is married to one of the maintenance workers. I am always polite to them, but have never talked to them by any means.So, yesterday I was working out on the tennis court which is near their apartment. Her and her husband were sitting on the porch. She is giving me the dirtiest looks and is making me pretty uncomfortable but I try to ignore it. Before I leave she says, ""Do you like get off on having the maintenance men check you out all day?"" To which I replied, ""Actually yes it makes me super wet. They are what keeps my sex drive high."" She looked shocked and her husband started laughing and then she smacked him on the arm. I came back and told my mom this story and she said I should be more sensitive and obviously the woman is insecure. Now I kinda feel bad. AITA?"
114,Not the A-hole,AITA for bringing my garden with me when I moved?,29741,hbdi4l,2528,"I F(25) have been renting a house since I was 18 (7 years). When I moved in, the backyard was a large piece of dirt, no lawn or anything, just a decently big backyard with a fence all around. It was a cheap but not great house, but I signed because I wanted the backyard space. Over the past few years I erected a small garden shed, greenhouse and pizza oven (transportables), planted lots of veggie gardens in big transportable garden beds, and put down some nice pavers, an aquaponics set up, and generally made the backyard a really green and beautiful place to be. It became the green oasis all my friends gathered at. A few months ago, my landlords let me know they were planning to sell, and my final move out day was a week ago. When I left, I brought my garden with me to my new place - nothing in my last backyard was directly planed into the ground, and nothing permanent. I dismantled the sheds and greenhouse, loaded up all the pots and garden beds onto a truck and cleared the backyard in three days with lots of help. My former landlords are furious over this, and demand that I return the backyard to the former state - apparently they’d listed the house for sale with pictures of the backyard and potential buyers were walking away from the house when they saw the barren backyard. They’re accusing me of stealing their plants, and wrecking the backyard.Legally I’m fine - my contract said I could garden, and I have photos from the first real estate walkthrough before I moved in that show that the backyard was in the same state as I first found it (although with more fertile soil now probably). The same real estate agent signed off my final inspection, and I got my deposit back. I’ve received mixed responses though, because I saw the landlords taking pictures of my backyard before I left but didn’t make the connection because imho when pictures of a house has furniture in it, you don’t expect to also get free furniture. Some of my coworkers suggested that IATA because the house valuation certainly has fallen dramatically because I didn’t tell them I was taking my garden with me, so they couldn’t plan to landscape before lockdown hit.Tl;dr AITA for moving my garden that I build from my former rental house into my new house, upsetting my former landlords who didn’t expect me to take it with me?"
115,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling relatives how much I make and defending my salary?,29711,i0oqvb,2546,"Over the weekend, I (23F) went to dinner with some of my dad’s relatives who I don’t see very often. My dad has never gotten along with my uncle (his brother) and I haven’t either. He’s rude, condescending, and we don’t agree with him on a lot of things. Normally I just try to ignore him. However, at dinner, my uncle asked me about my car I had shown up in and my new job. I started my job a little over a year ago after graduating college and I worked hard for it. I make a lot of money and I’m proud of that. (Software engineer.) I recently bought myself my dream car I’ve always wanted. Uncle asked “How much are they paying you anyway?” in a condescending tone, and I just point blank told him how much I make. I guess I was supposed to laugh and say something like “Oh, enough” but I told him the number. He started going off on a rant about how no 23-year-old should make that much money and how stupid my company is for paying me that much. I got pissed and said “I deserve every penny I make. I work hard and most people can’t do what I do.” Well, I guess this really made my uncle angry, because after dinner I received a text from my cousin saying I had been really rude at dinner and insulted my uncle’s intelligence. My dad sided with me (since he hates my uncle anyway) but my sister agreed with my cousin and said I shouldn’t have said how much money I make or talked to my uncle the way I did because it was impolite. AITA?EDIT: Wow, I didn’t expect for this to blow up! Thanks for the responses everyone. I feel justified in how I reacted now. For more info on my uncle - he’s a retired airline pilot, so I don’t think he’s even jealous/bitter about how much I make, he’s just a jerk."
116,Not the A-hole,"AITA for refusing to accept my parents ""gift"" and then walking out.",29705,ccnvdo,4761,"throwaway as my dad uses reddit. so I'm close to graduating high school and have been applying to universities and looking at some by doing the tours and stuff. my parents decided to give me a gift for when I graduate, its 10,000$ toward my uni costs. I remember screaming and hugging my parents and thanking them. that was untill I found out the terms and conditions, I can only go to 2 universities (they are the ones closest to my parents) and they gave me a selection of courses I can pick from, surprisingly art degree is not one of them. so I told my parents that I cant accept the gift as I dont want to abide by some terms and conditions,I also told them it was kinda shitty to pay me to do what they want me to do. i explained that i now feel bad for being super excited because i definitely cant accept my gift now knowing what the rules are.  this caused a massive fight where I was called ungrateful and that I'm not a nice daughter. so I walked out of the house and have been staying with a friend until this cools off. reflecting back I do think that I might be the asshole but I'm unsure so I've come to you. I will accept any judgment"
117,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking out my girlfriend because she said my relationship with my brother was disgusting.,29701,cx82jo,3268,"I’m(22M) a legal guardian of my 15 year old brother. We’re very close and we have always been like that. He lives with me now obviously. He often gets really sad, we recently lost our parents, so I comfort him as best as I can. So, about my girlfriend, we have been together for 2 years. She doesn’t live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys.2 days ago, she came over without warning me. Me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn’t wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me. She woke us up and made a scene in front of him. She said that our relationship was weird and disgusting and it’s extremely concerning that he’s so affectionate towards me. My brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. I brought him to his room and calmed him down. I went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. I told her to get the fuck out. She got defensive again and said that she was just stating her opinion without hurting anyone. I grabbed her wrist and brought her to door. I didn’t hurt her, she was following me, I didn’t use any force. She left, she called me few times but I didn’t answer.Update: thanks for all the comments. I talked to her, she still said that she didn’t do anything wrong,she didn’t hurt my brother and it wasn’t her fault that he started crying. I broke up with her. Also little info: this doesn’t happen often, we were on couch, watching tv and fell asleep. He laid on top of me after he fell asleep, he moves around a lot while sleeping."
118,Not the A-hole,AITA for not giving my brother and his wife any privacy?,29696,i1r9ka,3130,"My brother lost his job along with all his savings several months ago, and soon after he asked me if it would be okay if he (28M) and his wife (30F) stayed with me until they could afford their own place again. I hesitated at first, considering I only have a 1 bedroom apartment, but according to them they had 'no other options' so of course I invited them over and bought a blow-up mattress for the living room.For the first month things were manageable, although admittedly cramped. Then my brother told me that sleeping on the mattress was giving him back pains, so he asked if he could buy a small double bed for the living room. The living room is by far the biggest room I have, so I told him that would be fine as long as there was still room for my couch/TV/bookshelves.  The living room is also connected to my kitchen in an open plan style, so I reminded my brother to leave walking space around the bed.It's now been 2+ months and things have gotten a lot worse. When they first moved in, I would still use the living room every day to unwind on the couch after work. Now whenever I go in, there's a strange vibe like I'm intruding. My brother and his wife are often sitting in bed together when I go in (I always knock) and stare at me pointedly until I leave. Sometimes when I sit down they will directly ask me for some 'alone time' and say they would like the room to themselves.This came to a head yesterday when my sister-in-law messaged me with a 'timetable' she'd made of when it would be 'a good time' for me to use the living room. The timetable basically says that they will allow me into the room for an hour each evening, plus 20 minutes around mealtimes.I basically shut her down instantly and told her there was no WAY I'd be following the timetable since in the end it's my apartment. She sent me back a HUGE message with a dozen paragraphs about how my constant presence was 'ruining' her marriage with my brother and they feel like they have no privacy. I tried to talk this over with my brother that night, but when I got home neither my brother/SIL were talking to me, so he's clearly just as pissed. Today an Amazon parcel arrived for my brother with a lock for the living room door, which I told him there's 'absolutely no way' I will allow him to install. My brother says I'm 'creepy' for wanting constant access to where they sleep and he's insisting on installing the lock anyway.AITA for not giving my brother and his wife their privacy?"
119,Not the A-hole,"AITA: I, a female, want to give my fiance my last name, but my father and brother don't want me to. Am I wrong for planning on doing it anyways?",29622,eh8f8j,3475,"To start, my fiance is willing and happy to take my last name-- he grew up with a horrible father. He has no attachment to his last name and no siblings. I have a very unique last name and a strong attachment to it. I brought this up to my father and he said wasn't so sure about it, given my brother is the only male in the family who would carry on the name. My brother found out before I could bring it up to him and called me, saying I was being inconsiderate and couldn't believe he hadn't been asked. This got me irritated, because in my opinion, I have just a right to share my name as he did with his wife. He and his wife have been married for over a year and I think they feel possessive about the fact they were the only ones ""supposed"" to carry on our name.I think the fact that this is an issue at all is rather sexist. It's my last name too and if I want to give my future husband--who has never had the privilege of feeling like he belongs to a family-- my name, no one should take issue. I have three sisters who aren't yet married, but they shouldn't have to feel bad about giving their name either. I don't feel like I'm being selfish here, but AITA for breaking tradition?*UPDATE* Did not expect this to blow up! My father and brother are amazing people and husbands—I think they were caught off guard by my thinking more than anything else. I’ve let it go for now, but will bring it up again simply to explain my thinking and I believe they will understand. They are rational, empathetic human beings, if a little old school sometimes :) As for my fiancé— he is absolutely amazing and all my family approves . When I originally brought up keeping my last name, he was the one who suggested taking mine as well. He’s perfectly secure in his masculinity for all those wondering lmao.Thank you for all the encouragement! My fiancé and I will be rocking our kickass last name soon enough."
120,Not the A-hole,AITA For Not Forgiving My Husband (26m) For A Mistake And Not Trusting Him With Our Child?,29537,itg9l6,4012,"Throwaway account&#x200B;I (24f) gave birth to my daughter six months ago and it should've been the happiest moment in my life. When my daughter was born her skin was very dark and looked like she could have two biological parents who were of African descendent. My husband Jim (26m), fake name, was furious and accused me of cheating and left right then and there. He told everyone on both sides of the family what happened, made posts on social media and wanted a divorce. His family and a lot of our friend all called to say how upset they were at me and called me really nasty names. My mother was by my side the entire time and I kept professing my innocence. Jim refused to pick me up from the hospital, threw my stuff out on the lawn and changed the locks, so I had to stay with my parents. When my sister called to ask for the baby stuff Jim texted me pictures of the bare nursery room and said he got rid of everything. He even destroyed my Art studio, I like to paint, and the art I made and told me my work would be too awful to sell. I was distraught and tried to focus on my baby.Weeks went by and Jim refused to speak to me directly and has never once asked about our child. Eventually he agreed to do a paternity and he was 100% the father. No one could believe the results and it was done again, Jim's the dad. Around that same time one of Jim's cousins did the Ancestry thing and there was around 30% of African ancestry in the family. This combined with the test Jim paternal great-grandmother admitted to having an affair around the time Jim's grandfather was born and was because he could pass she just assumed her husband was the father.Since then Jim has been reaching out and everyone has come to apologize, and while it did feel good to feel vindicated the damage has been done. I can't un-hear or unsee all the horrible things that was said and done. Not just to me but to my child as well. Jim made some very racist remarks. Things that I thought he'd never say and he did it so easily. Regardless of what our daughter looks like I don't want her to be around that. What else will Jim and his family say or do the next time they get mad? How are they going to treat our daughter when she does something that upsets them?Jim has been begging for forgiveness. I said I needed time, he asked to see the baby and I let him but I'm too afraid to physically hand her to him. He's repairing the the nursery and keeps asking me what I would like and I cry every time saying we already had what I liked and some of the items that we had can't be replaced. He asked me if I still loved him and I admitted that he showed me his worst self and I don't know if I could live with that image. I didn't mean to be hurtful but it's how I feel. My sister suggested Couple's Therapy but I don't feel like I should have to work to fix something that I didn't break. I've never cheated and have been 100% innocent in all of this the whole. AITA for not wanting to give Jim a second chance?Update 1: I stepped away for a few hours and couldn't believe what I came back to. I am truly amazed by all the wonderful comments of support as well as the private messages. I also understand why some people may think this is fake and all I can say is that you are free to believe what you want in this. I also see some questions and I think I should clarify a few things just in case your judgement may change.1. All of this initially happened at the near February and I was already settled at my parents' house before the pandemic hit.2. One of the reasons Jim wouldn't pick me up from the hospital was because I wouldn't admit to cheating or give him any details, because there weren't any which made him angrier.3. Based on the pictures Jim sent me he didn't take a sledgehammer to the crib or anything. He just took stuff down to either return it for the money or gave it away. While deeply hurtful I wouldn't call it violent, but maybe it is.4. Online he announced that I ""pushed out a dark skinned baby"" and was going to he was divorce me. His family started with the racial comments and eventually he started doing it too but only through my family, he refused to speak to me directly.5. Once the truth came out everything he and his family posts were all taken down but I, and a few friends, still have the screenshots. Jim never wrote down his racial remarks.6. While he didn't say any of the racist words he did make comments about our daughter being a ""Welfare Princess,"" and how I was going to be just another ""baby mama.""7. Just to clarify. Jim is ""white"" and I am at least half white. One of my parents is adopted and with everything that's happened they decided to do the Ancestry thing too and we should be getting the results any day now.Update 2: Spelling Errors  Update 3:   Mod denied separate post so it's here as an edit.Thank you so for all your words of encouragement a couple months back, both in posts and the DMs. A lot of things have happened since my initial post and I just needed time to process it and be in a place where I can write about on social media. So here it goes....First, my parent who was adopted did the Ancestry/23 thing and it turns out that Jim wasn't the only one who had African ancestry. My parent had at least 45%, which means I have at least 20%. I am legally separated from my husband with primary custody, and I'm living with my parents until further notice. He still keeps apologizing and wants me to come back to the house, he even offered to leave so I could stay with our daughter but I don't want to and really like having the support of my parents. My dad is retired so he does a lot of the babysitting while my mother and I work remotely.I do go to the house every so often so Jim can see his daughter and for Couple's Counseling via telecom. In one of the sessions Jim confessed something really hurtful and some of you guessed right, he cheated. It was while we were dating, before he proposed, and his treatment towards me was a projection. It was with an ex-girlfriend who had cheated on him and he hooked up with her as an ego boost. He started to feel guilty but was too scared that I would walk away to ever confess. Jim also admitted that he was scared when I got pregnant (our baby wasn't planned), was very anxious about being a father, but just pretended to be excited because he didn't want to look like an A. My husband was so willing to believe that our daughter wasn't his because he thought he had an out. Now that he knows that our child is his and has spent time with her Jim regrets everything and just wants his family back and is willing to spend the rest of his life making it up to us.This was all deeply hurtful and I've cried about it more than once. Jim has been lying to me and my ability to trust him hasn't improved at all. When the holidays came around Jim's parents asked about seeing their grandchild and I didn't want to. They told me that it was selfish of me to keep her away and I reminded them of their past. They said that they've already apologized and tried to minimize the situation. They said that I can't be angry forever and that I need to learn to forgive them. I'm so ashamed of ever loving and marrying into this family and wonder why I didn't see this before. I've decided to contact a lawyer and will be filing for divorce after my daughter's first Birthday."
121,Not the A-hole,"AITA for ""mansplaining"" vaginas to a woman?",29530,gwxbxu,2318,"This happened a few months ago, but my brain won't let this one go.So I was hanging out with some friends. Two guys, one woman. We're all in our early 20s and have had our fair share of romance in life. The topic of sex popped up and we start talking about some of our past experiences. One guy joked about how having sex only made his dick bigger and bigger. We all laughed and he said that he wished that's how it works. My female friend (let's call her Sarah) piped up and said ""Yeah, for women, it's the complete opposite. The more sex you have, the bigger your labia gets and the looser you become."" There were some chuckles, but then I asked her if she was serious. She said she was.Now, this is a big myth. I was surprised a woman who has had some experience actually believes that. I basically told her this, and then she started getting annoyed, asking ""how me and my dick knows about that"". I said the same way I know anything about female anatomy- I've read up on it. The whole ""women get looser"" thing is something sexist dudes made up to slut-shame women. My other friends were silent on this. She then just said: ""Whatever, I'm not in the mood for your mansplaining.""So I'm at a loss here. AITA for explaining something that I feel like people should just know about?"
122,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling my parents how to read my diary?,29467,hjwxmn,2294,"I am 15f and I have diary, and to prevent my older sister from reading it I created a new alphabet and to make it even harder to decode its not just the Latin alphabet that looks differently, i made some sounds like Yu, Ya, Sh, etc as one letter, like they are in Cyrillic. (Alphabet Russian, Bulgarian, Kazakh etc use)Well my parents were snooping in my room and found my diary, and are demanding i tell them how to decode it so they can read it. They are saying that i need to share this with them and i can't have secrets from them and im under their roof. I eventually got sick of it and told them to fuck off. They sent me to my room and I'm here. They keep trying to decode my diary which I doubt they will but fuck this sucks.EDIT: I'm making this post, hopefully this can knock some sense into my parents"
123,Not the A-hole,AITA for making a big deal about 1 extra credit point on my child's test?,29439,kb4og9,2358,"My daughter had a spelling test which included some holiday words for extra credit. One of the words was ""Chanukah"". My daughter spelled it the way I just did, but the teacher marked it wrong and corrected it to ""Hanukkah"". She said to my daughter ""you're Jewish and you don't know how to spell Hanukkah?"" I think she meant it jokingly but my daughter was annoyed. My daughter told the teacher that Chanukah is correct, but the teacher didn't believe her.I told the teacher that Chanukah was also correct and that my daughter should get the point, and the teacher argued with me, saying that Hanukkah is more correct because it's more commonly used than Chanukah. I said if any spelling is more correct it would be Chanukah because the Ch represents the sound from the back of the throat you're supposed to make.The teacher agreed to correct the test but seemed really sour about it and said she was just trying to be inclusive. I said I appreciate that but she should keep in mind that if the word isn't in English that there might be multiple acceptable spellings for it and that they should all be given credit.My husband says I overreacted. Honestly I probably wouldn't have bothered so much if the word was something else, but I resented the teacher, who isn't Jewish, arguing with me and my daughter about how to spell our own holiday."
124,Not the A-hole,AITA for punishing my sons and not the woman?,29347,h8ypa1,2505,"I’m going to try to keep this short since frankly - I’m exhausted. Any questions can and will be answered in the comments. Long story short, my family(35m, 12m, 10m) and I(32f) just recently moved into a new apartment complex. Our unit is at the very back of the building, at the back of the property, so behind us is just a wooded area, nobody lives there. At the very back of our unit and the one across from ours is a small balcony that faces out towards this wooded area. Because it the way the building is constructed, you can’t see onto another persons balcony unless you go to the stairs and lean over the railing - otherwise the wall blocks you.Across from our unit is a family of four - a young looking mother, her husband, and their two children who are both under the age of two. I haven’t had the chance to go introduce myself because I think one of their babies is a newborn, and honestly mama seems exhausted. Anyway, a couple of nights ago, I made a horrific discovery. Went outside to call the boys in for dinner and found them both with their upper bodies flung over the railing, staring into our neighbors balcony. I grab both by their pants and ask them just what they think they’re doing, and that’s when I see it. From their vantage point, they could see straight into the neighbor lady’s balcony, where she was sat completely topless, with underwear on listening to headphones. I. Was. Livid. Not with her, but with the boys. The way I see it, she’s on her own personal property, where no one is SUPPOSED to be able to see, and not drawing any attention to herself. Plus, if she’s breastfeeding, I get not having a top or bra on. It’s tedious to remove every few hours and for every feeding in between. And who wears pants in their own house? Anyway, I digress. I pulled the boys in the house and took away their video games and phones until further notice, and told my husband immediately when he got home. But surprisingly, HE was mad at ME! Saying boys would be boys and the lady should have some decency to wear clothes outside, and asked me to speak to her about it. I ripped him a new one and spent the night on the couch, after which he apologized but the boys still seem upset with me. AITA for punishing them, but not saying anything to the neighbor?Edit: Typo, and further explained question"
125,Not the A-hole,"AITA? My husband and I are getting my stepson a car for his birthday. His mother wants to chip in and say that the car is from all of us, but I don’t want to do that.",29343,dfzi7d,5424,"My stepson is turning 18 soon and my husband and I decided that we will be getting him a car. I make more than my husband does and we will be splitting the cost of the car 70/30. That’s fine with me.His mother is a woman who I make the effort to be civil with but don’t like. I am much younger than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background; she had a lot of things to say about that. She called me her ex’s cash cow and that’s one of the better things she said about me. We are not friends and I won’t even describe her as nice to me.When my husband told her that we will buy my stepson a car for his birthday, she said she wants to chip in 5% of the cost and then we could tell my stepson that the gift is from all of his parents and step parents. I don’t want to do that. I don’t need her 5% and my stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share the cost of buying the car. I don’t want recognition for paying 70% of his gift’s cost but I don’t want to share my and my husband’s gift to my stepson with a woman who has always been antagonistic to me.I don’t know why she wants us to gift the car jointly now because we’ve never given my stepson a gift jointly before. And I don’t understand what’s so bad about getting separate gifts from me and his dad, and his mom and his stepdad.I know that many people will say that it’s better for my stepson to see that all his parents and step parents are getting along. I’m civil to his mom and I never talk negatively about her to him. Is that not enough? Am I incapable of being a good step mother to him if I’m not best friends with his mom? Do I have to let his mom get her way whenever she asks in the name of all parents getting along?"

He recently discovered a charity project where they fixed up an old Jaguar. It's worth around $300000. You could buy a ticket for $50 to enter and the money went towards a good cause.My bf is broke at the moment so I offered to go halves with the ticket. He didn't want to because then the car wouldn't be his completely. I wasn't too worried about it and didn't mention it again. I did however buy a ticket for myself.Well, I won and as of August 1st will be the owner of the car. When my boyfriend found out he was really excited until I told him that I was going to sell it and put half of it in my savings and invest half of it. he said I can't sell OUR car without consulting him. I told him it's MY car and I can do whatever I want. He now claims it was all a big misunderstanding and apparently he wanted to go halves but hasn't got around to giving me the money yet. I call bs on it but he keeps saying that we're a couple and we should make decisions together.AITA for going ahead with the plan to sell the car and keep the money to myself?Edit.

127,Not the A-hole,AITA for replying to a rude customer in the language they were speaking in front of me?,29312,exk08u,2532,"I'm a slave to the siren (a Starbucks barista). I'm pretty decent with most customers and I'm pretty good at having convos with customers and sensing when someone just wants the line moved forward.Anyway, I was on register the other day, taking people's orders. Two older men were ordering from me. One of them said ""a coffee, black"", so I just asked to clarify the size he wanted and the roast (blonde, medium or dark) to which he first spoke to his friend and said, rudely""Nou zeg, niet de slimste meid die hier werkt, hè? Ze zouden en beetje kunnen leeren om hun hersenen te gebruiken""Which is Dutch and translates roughly to ""Wow, (this is) not the smartest gal that works here, huh? They could learn to use their brains a little""Then he told me he wanted a medium dark roast. So I nodded and then replied to him in Dutch, asking him the regular questions I would to complete an order (anything else to eat or drink today?, What was your name for your other drinks? Do you have a Starbucks rewards card?). I was perfectly pleasant and smiley for the rest of the transaction but just conducted it in Dutch. He answered the questions in English but his eyes were bulging out of his head. His friend looked kind of worried but burst out laughing when they walked away.I realize it might not be the best look for someone in service, and when my coworker asked me what it was about and I explained, she seemed kinda confused as to why I would do that.I don't think it was an asshole move because I was still nice to the guy but I definitely called him out and made it clear to him that I'd understood the stuff he was saying.

My parents help me when they can. My sister doesn't like my son, she once told me she thinks he's an annoyance and hinderance. If he cries she complains. If there's baby clothes in the laundry she complains. Basically the baby exists and that pisses her off. I'm not perfect but I'm trying my best to be a good dad. My sister has never offered to help with the baby beyond holding him briefly and she hasn't done that more than about four or five times since he was born.The other day my friend called and offered me a really great opportunity for some side-work. He works construction and they needed an extra guy for some installation work. Four hours and I'd get $400.00. I jumped at it, any extra money can only help. I started trying to find a babysitter. My sister was hanging out in the living room while I walked around the house on the phone. I managed to find a sitter who said she didn't want to be paid and went to get the baby ready. My sister asked me why I didn't ask her when she was sitting right there. I told her I didn't think she'd want to since she'd never offered to help before. She told me it was different, this was for work and not just me wanting to sleep or whatever, and he was about to go down for his nap and he's pretty easy when first wakes up, she told me it wouldn't be a problem.I asked her why she didn't say something between phone calls and she said she didn't think she needed too because we're family and family asks each other for help. I reminded her of all the times she'd complained about the baby and me and called him names and told me she waited he'd never been born and asked her why she thought I'd ever trust her with my son. She started crying and told me that wasn't fair and I needed to remember that the whole house was dealing with a baby and she was just having a hard time adjusting but she'd never do anything to hurt him. I told her she should have spoken to me about her feelings instead of acting like a child, took my son and left. When I got home both my parents set in on me because my sister told them I'd accused her of bad intentions to the baby. AITA for being honest when my sister offered to babysit?ETA: apparently God is on my side right now. The lady I mentioned in the post who babysat my son for me, she goes to church with my mom and when I dropped my son off I explained that I was having trouble finding a sitter or paying for daycare. She called the pastor and explained the situation and two days a week my son can attend the church nursery school from 7am-12pm for free!!, and the lady has offered to take my son one day a week during the same time-frame and has also found another lady who will take him for one day a week, same time-frame. The ladies both requested $50.00, which I'm happy to pay. That means there's only one day a week and three hours in the mornings that I need childcare and my mom has agreed to watch him for the three hours and drop him off! I still have to figure out Fridays but Monday-Thursday are covered. I can breathe again."
129,Not the A-hole,AITA for spiking my leftovers with Ghost Pepper flakes to teach my brother a lesson,29134,cavukv,1267,"So my little brother is notorious for eating other people's food knowing it's not his. After several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. A few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. I wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing I'd eat it the next day. Since all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. I got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. I open the fridge grab MY BOX and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. I know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so I knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. I'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. Knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon I decided to sprinkle Ghost Pepper flakes on the last two slices. We actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. So I'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. This fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more. After he finishes nuking it he bites into one slice and I get up to the fridge to grab and hide the milk. I hear him freaking out and he didn't stop crying for an hour."
130,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my parents I won't drive my brother to school unless he is more hygienic because his smell literally makes me sick?,29098,d1wohr,2136,"I'm a high school senior and my brother is a high school freshman. I have a car that I bought with money I'd saved from work, and I pay my own gas. However my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.They said I need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. And the problem is that I get motion sick easily; even when I'm driving. Too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when I'm in a car make me feel ill too.I'm not exaggerating, I've always been like this. As a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. I always make sure I know where my barf bag is on a plane. I always used to take motion sickness pills, but I'm not allowed when I'm driving because they make you tired.Anyway, I can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me I literally feel so sick because of his BO. Even with the windows on my side openMy friend told me I should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. Right now, he doesn't do that, he likes to sleep in to the last minute, skip showers most days, pick clothes up off the floor to wear, skip brushing his teeth, etc.So I did that and told my mom and dad that I couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. Either they could check or I would. And they blew up at me saying that I was being nasty and humiliating, that if I wouldn't drive my brother I couldn't drive. And I said fine; I'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.And that caused a big fight, because I guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.AITA for what I did?"
131,Not the A-hole,"AITA for getting my family to do a ""swear tax"" after my dad told me off for swearing? (My dad and brothers cuss like sailors but apparently me cussing is unladylike?)",29063,hfr4xe,987,"I am living with my family, it's me a 15 year old girl, my twin brothers who are 17, and my parents.My dad cusses a lot, and so do my older brothers. But apparently the standards are different for me, my dad overheard me saying a couple cuss words when I was on the phone with my friends and he got mad at me for my language, and for how trashy and unladylike it was.This wasn't the first time he called me (and only me) out for bad language, but it was the one that frustrated me the most because I could tell there was a double standard.I thought of calling him out on his language and hipocracy, but then I had a different idea.---I said that yeah, it was a bad habit I was forming and didn't want to make a pattern... because if I got in the habit of cussing a lot, that wouldn't make me come off well when I start getting jobs or going to college. And as I was growing up, I wanted to learn how to speak respectfully and intelligently.But it was hard to keep from bad habits, when I heard him and my brothers having potty-mouth-syndrome so often. They're setting an example whether they realize it or not... So I wanted to work on things for myself, but also together as a family. I suggested we make a ""Swear Tax"" where if anyone swears in front of anyone else who's participating, they give a dollar to each person who heard them. I'd want that rule for myself because it would keep me accountable and I'd really like it if the family joined me for it...----So my dad said he'd join, and so would my mom. They got my brothers to be a part of it too. They didn't really have a choice, my parents decided to make it a rule.I know it's kinda petty but I wanted to make the point that my dad and brothers swear a lot and I almost never do. In the few months we've had the rule, I've gotten about 250 dollars from hearing my dad and brothers cuss, and have not sworn once. It's kinda making my brothers angry because they often cuss when they're mad, and I ask them for money, so they get madder and cuss more, so I get more money until they shut up.My dad actually got mad at me too, he was having some drinks, calling his brother and talking, and I came over after and asked for 18 dollars. He actually said he wouldn't give me that much, and there should be a cutoff. He gave me 5 dollars which sends a weird message... Like swearing is bad, unless you wanna swear A LOT, then it's cool??I feel like I've made my point already so really now I'm just continuing to ""want the family to learn not to cuss"" for the money, and it's really making my brothers mad.AITA for having the idea for the ""family swear tax"" after my dad got angry at me for swearing? I did it because I know I swear the least out of my family but I was the only one getting in trouble for it"
132,Not the A-hole,AITA for having pot cookies out in the open in my own home?,29029,hc7wd7,1508,"this is an ongoing situation, and am currently writing this as my niece is having a full-on meltdown. so I apologize for any mistakes.today was my day off and i decided to whip up a batch of pot cookies (cookies that have weed extract in them) so i can snack on them for the weekend. after they finish baking i left them out on a cooling tray so they can set. just as i finished cleaning up the kitchen i hear the door bell and went to answer, and surprise surprise it's my sister with 8yo niece and husband. it's been awhile since I've last seen them to it was a happy surprise. i let them in, and the smell of cookies still in the air, and niece goes bolting towards the kitchen. i instantly go chasing her and as i round the corner into the kitchen, niece had just grabbed a cookie and was about to eat it, quick on my feet i swooped in and grabbed the cookie out of her hand saying that these were adult cookies. which caused niece to start freaking out. my sister followed in and i explained to her that these cookies had pot in them and assured her i was able to take the cookie away from niece before she had ate any.she instantly blows up at me saying i shouldn't have pot cookies out when there are kids in the house, i explained how i had just finished baking them and they were setting, and the fact that i didn't expect ANY children to be around (i am a single man, no kids), she asked if i had any thing that wasn't ""laced"" and unfortunately i didn't, by this point niece has locked herself in the bathroom and is crying.and my sister gave me a big ol' lecture about having drugs in reach of kids, while i stand on the premise of, there wouldn't be an issue *if i had even known they were planning on dropping by today.* she called me a huge irresponsible asshole, and i responded ""well maybe if you taught your daughter to not just grab shit, we wouldn't be in this mess!""she left to try to get niece out of the bathroom and i'm sat here typing this, am i really the asshole here? like i can understand not having drugs out in the open with kids around, and i never would - *if i had known there were going to be kids around.*also, before i get any flak, i'm in Canada and weeds legal here."
133,Not the A-hole,AITA? My parents took most of my wardrobe away as punishment and I said I didn't want the clothes back because it's obvious they're not actually mine.,28992,g5hta8,2957,"I got in trouble at school this fall, I'm a junior in high school. (Edit to add what I got in trouble for since a couple people asked... I smoked weed with a guy in the woods after school once and got caught. I also made out with him a couple times and my parents found out about that too)As punishment my parents took away a lot of my things; all my clothes except 3 pairs of plain jeans and 3 plain black shirts and my coat. And all my makeup and hair stuff, purses and shoes; saying I had to earn things back with good behavior, I don't get to engage in my hobby (fashion) till I've earned it.Anyway it was a shitty couple months but I came to a couple realizations.It was actually kind of nice to not have to think about what to wear and how I look.  My friends knew what my parents had done and didn't judge me. I also told anyone who asked why I looked like I only had one outfit what was up and it was no big deal.I know it was supposed to be a demeaning humiliating punishment to make me look bad at school but honestly it just makes them look bad when people at school know I'm only allowed to wear one thing.I don't want to have things that are just something someone else can hold over my head. I don't want the old clothes and makeup back, if I'm gonna get back into that stuff I'll do it on my own terms; I'll buy my own stuff.So I told my parents that I don't care if they keep the clothes and makeup; they've made it clear that stuff doesn't belong to me. And it's gross to me to spend every day wearing clothes that aren't mine, that can be given and taken as punishment. I'd feel gross and I'd rather not wear them again.So now my parents are mad because they've got a lot of clothes boxed up in the attic that the family spent money on and that are going to waste. Nobody else can wear them; my mom isn't my size and my only sibling is my little brother.I said I don't care, I want clothes that are my own and those aren't it. AITA for not taking the clothes back and letting them go to waste?"
134,Not the A-hole,WIBTA for running away on our honeymoon?,28956,f2f25v,1782,"(not from my husband)My husband and I are on our honeymoon. His parents gifted us a week in an all inclusive hotel at no cost to us as a wedding gift, and we were really grateful. On arriving we found out that they'd also booked a room at this hotel for themselves for the whole week and want to do group things. Outside of this, we see them maybe 2 or 3 times a year for a couple days at a time as he finds them a bit overbearing at times and they don't really like me.It's not like they're in the room next door or anything and we can still do stuff in our room alone but they knock on our door regularly, waking us up at 6am, making us get all 3 meals a day with them. We've tried telling them we wanted ""alone time"" for our honeymoon and they shrugged us off saying that's what our room is for. We also tried faking illness to get out of eating with them and they just got room service to our room and sat with us while we faked stomach aches. My husband snapped earlier and said this whole thing was way over the line and they had no right intruding on our honeymoon of all things, and they told us that they paid for this whole thing and that as adults we're allowed to take holidays at the same time to the same place.We've been talking and we saved up to pay for our own honeymoon before they surprised us. We still have the money we would have spent in our joint wedding/honeymoon account. There's another town we wanted to go to on our honeymoon and we looked it up and we could get tickets from here to there and then back home for less than £60 total. We could also book a few days in a nice hotel for about half of what's left in our wedding/honeymoon fund and use the remainder of the week we booked off in another town without his parents knowing we'd left until we had.It's 9pm now, there's trains from here to the other town every hour, plus more half-hourly trains tomorrow.Would we be the arseholes if we ran away from his parents without telling them?Update: our train should be arriving in our final station in the next 30 mins, we've found a hotel that's able to take us tonight, and we are very excited about the next 4 days"
135,Not the A-hole,"AITA for insisting if I can't have my partner over, neither can anyone else?",28893,degzhj,3188,"Throwaway bc flatmates have reddit. So I [20m] live in a flat with 3 other people; childhood best friend [23f], a guy from my uni course [20m] and his cousin [26f]. For the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. However this has been a real point of contention lately. About six months ago I began a relationship with a guy I've known for a couple of years [21m]. I know it's still a fairly new relationship but I really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. Up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. This was mostly due to the fact that I have chronic fatigue and going on ""proper"" dates can be really challenging for me. Instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch TV and get takeout or cook together. I didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10PM because of his work schedule. So the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that I need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's ""starting to get annoying"". I asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there ""skulking around all the time"". I pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. She said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's ""getting ridiculous"". Note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. I confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. I asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. I pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.My potential assholery: I've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  If I answer the door to anyone's partner I'll send them away. If I come home and someone's partner is there I'll make a point to mention that I thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. I've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. Everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me I'm being unreasonable. I know I'm being petty, but I think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and I'm trying to make that point. Am I really the asshole here?ETA: some questions people keep asking: 1. If I knew of something my boyfriend was doing to be annoying/if anyone had told me that he was doing something I'd have included it. I'm not aware of anything he does and when I ask why 26f doesn't like him I just get a shrug and ""just do"". I will also state I'm bi, and she's never had an issue with any female partners I've had. 2. We don't hang out in the living room much. We literally only use it if there's something we want to watch that I can't get on my bedroom TV and there's nobody else in there. We use the kitchen more often than the living room, but honestly even that isn't that often (we eat far too much takeout pizza rip) 3. A lot of people seem confused so just clearing up who's who in the situation: the one who brought all this up is 26F, *not* my best friend. My best friend is 23F. Not to get too much into a tangent, but basically just over a year ago I was moving out of halls at university and 23F was looking for a new place so we decided to move in together. At the same time, a dude from my course - 20M - was looking for a flatshare. We couldn't find a 3 bed but found a really nice 4 bed and he mentioned his cousin - 26F - was also looking for somewhere to live so she got on board too. I only met her last year and we don't really know each other very well.4. By chronic fatigue I mean chronic fatigue syndrome sorry that's apparently so unclear."
136,Not the A-hole,AITA for proving to my roommate that her boyfriend keeps hitting on me?,28704,flvmtn,1669,"I’m Sam, my roommates name is Lauren, and her boyfriends name is Mark. Lauren and Mark have been dating for maybe four months. Mark always hits on me. Like always. As soon as Lauren walks away, Mark is laying it on thick with compliments, and asking when our lease is up. I wear a lot of body-con and sometimes low cut clothing , so I expect to get glances maybe mild staring. But this guy is very obviously hitting on me, and often times in ways that make me uncomfortable, especially since he is always at our apartment.  I have told Lauren several times that Mark hits on me, and she just rolls her eyes. She doesn’t believe me, which is confusing to me. Lauren and I have been roommates for five years. In that time she has dated three other guys, and I have never complained about this before. So yesterday she tells me that Mark is coming over. I was like, great, I told her if she would just walk upstairs in our apartment building, and tell Mark that she was going around the block, she would walk in and see him hitting on me. She actually agreed to do it to “humor” me. Mark gets to the apartment, and I am just doing the dishes, I tell him that Lauren went to the store up the block, but she is really right outside the door. He sits at the counter and starts chatting with me normally, then the conversation turns to him hitting on me. Normally I just walk away from Mark, but I endured it so that Lauren would see/hear.She came in and told Mark to go to her room. Then she then she starts yelling at *ME*. Saying I saying I tried to seduce him and that I dressed like a slut. And I’m like “I *always* dress like a slut Lauren! Who cares! Your boyfriend is hitting on me!”We argued and both said some shitty stuff to each other. She and Mark are staying in her bedroom and we haven’t spoken to each other since. As I’m thinking about it, I’m wondering if I am an asshole for even trying to do this but at the same time I think she sucks for not believing me in the first place. I live in New York. I love my neighborhood I don’t want to have to find a new roommate because of this idiot. If I did an asshole thing please tell me. AITA"
137,Not the A-hole,AITA for cutting up and altering my wedding dress into a functional dress instead of giving it to my sister who can't afford an expensive dress?,28695,erfvwt,2545,"I need an unbiased opinion on this because I don't know if i was the asshole.Throwaway because I am active in other communities and I don't want this to mix.So I was supposed to get married 2 moths ago to my ex partner of 5 years. Sadly we broke it off because he cheated on me on his bachelor party with a striper.I had this beautiful dress that cost me arround 2k dollars (out of my pocket). I had been very depressed since everything happened because I felt it was somehow my fault for not being sexy enough or not giving him what he wanted. So last weekend I decided to ""take my power back"" and I began altering the dress. I have been sewing for 15 plus years so I know what I am doing. I cut it a bit, changed the color to something less wedding-y and after a week of work I had a beautiful gown that I could use for more stuff.The problem comes now. I uploaded that picture of the dress to Instagram with a caption that said something along the lines of "" you can change the worst memories"" or some shit like that.My sister hits me up and asks me if that was my old wedding dress and I told her yes. She then called me and asked me why I had done this. I asked her why it was such a big deal. And she told me that I could have waited till after he wedding. I was so confused. Then she reminded me that when we were staying at the hotel where my wedding was supposed to happen my mom and sister where there cheering me up and my sister said something along the lines of ""oh well if you are not using it i will"". We all laughed so I thought it was a joke because it was never brought up again after. She just asked me once what material it was so I assumed she wanted something similar.Now my sister is mad at me and my mom says she understands our povs. But that I could have waited 5 more moths till after her wedding to ""take my power back""AITA?Edit : yes he fucked the stripper please stop asking meEdit2: what the fuck is wrong with some of you. Suddenly I am the asshole for leaving my ex for cheating on me because it doesn't count because it was his bachelor party? Do you know how relationships work. Are you also going to tell me that if he cheated on a Saturday it wouldn't count? Or if he left the country? This is hilarious coming from a sub that says cheaters are the worst people In this world. Cheating is cheating period"
138,Not the A-hole,"AITA For walking out on a double date my friend set up with him, his girlfriend and a girl I had already rejected before",28686,hgr9s6,1366,"I feel like I need to say this for this post not to be removed, this is not about the date, about relationships or something I want a judgement on me walking out of there.Cast: Me (25M), Joe(26M), Jane(24F)To give you a little background to this situation, I met Jane through Joe's girlfriend at her birthday party last year. At first Jane was fun to talk to but not even an hour later Jane was really in to me and tried really badly to hit on me during the party, which pretty much ruined my time there as the feeling was not mutual in the slightest bit also at the time I was already with someone. So the first impression I got from Jane was that she was clingy, annoying and just wouldn't stop bothering me.Unfortunately for me she became part of my larger friend group because she is part of Joe's girlfriends friend group(That is a mouthful sheesh) and because me and Joe hang out a lot and I am also friends with his girlfriend, I pretty much run in to her at minimum twice a month.So first time Jane asked me out was a month after that party, I informed her I was with someone and not interested, she tried again a 2 months later when I broke up with my then girlfriend, again I declined her advances and told her I was not interested. I got in to a new relationship not long after but unfortunately she and I broke up about 2 months ago. Since then as you might have anticipated, Jane has asked me out again, I said no again.Well that brings us to this week, everything has been opening up here and Joe had been trying to fix me up with a friend of his girlfriend and would not tell me who(He is well aware of me having rejected Jane multiple times and the fact I am not interested in her, he knows this in detail.) After a lot of what he calls convincing and I call whining(I had no interest in dating anytime soon) I relented and decided to agree to this double date idea of his.We agree on meeting at Joe's apartment and lo and behold Joe, His girlfriend and Jane are occupying  the dinner table obviously intending for my date to be Jane, I honestly just got so goddamn angry I that I couldn't even get a single word out, turned around and left.I have been bombarded with texts and calls about how much of a douche I am and how terribly I hurt Jane and so on and I am just like, I literally rejected her like three times, I am not interested in her, you knew that, your girlfriend knew that, our entire friend group has a running joke about obsessive Jane FFS so literally everyone knows it. So am I the asshole?"
139,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my husband to lose the entitled attitude and do shit for himself?,28669,j5jidt,1770,"Just recently my husband (31) was promoted to assistant manager of the warehouse. We both work on the ups of 50 hours a week. I am shift manager at a behavioral disorders facility. Both jobs are very hands on and strenuous. Since his promotion he has developed an entirely different attitude. Extremely entitled and dare I say rude as all fuck. He is always boasting and bragging. This has been going on for 3 weeks. So, some examples are as followed: on his days off he wants the house to be radio silent. If our 4 year old wants to play, he tells her to stick to her bedroom because he needs peace and quiet after ""working so hard"". If I make our daughter lunch, he will immediately say ""wheres mine?"" He asks me to grab him things damn near constant all hours of the night. He expects nightly back rubs but if I ask he will scoff at me and say ""I worked all day"" (even if I had as well). He expects meals that HE likes made every night, regardless if me or our daughter like the meal or not. He also now acts like he has full say over the money because he ""makes more"". Last night was the tip of the iceberg for me. Before this I let a lot of shit slide because it was a recent promotion and hell, hes excited! So, I get it. But last night around like 11pm (I was in bed scrolling through my phone) he comes into the bedroom, lays down and says ""babe you should go make me some ice cream. I want the chocolate drizzle on it. And oh, dont forget the cashews!"" Then he starts scrolling through his phone. I ignore it because I feel at this point I was going to snap. He then shook my leg and said ""Did you hear me?"" So I responded with ""Yeah. I did hear you and no. Go make it yourself. You were literally just out there. Your sense of fucking entitlement is way out of line. Do shit for yourself."" He became offended and instantly, like fucking clock work, said ""But I worked all fucking day!"" So I snapped back with ""Yeah, I did too! In fact, I worked 12 hours to your 8. Like I said, do shit for yourself."" He is now saying that he is not acting entitled and that I was just taking my bad day out on him and that everything I said makes him feel unappreciated. AITA? Did I push it too far?"
140,Not the A-hole,"AITA for refusing to sell the place I bought with ""stripper money""?",28640,ibbwws,3953,"For several years I was a stripper. I have no shame about what I did, and only quit when I got a better job offer. In the time I worked as a stripper, I intentionally lived as cheaply as possible (shitty little studio flat, living off ramen, wearing old clothes) because my coworkers all told me that they were able to buy their own places on their income, so long as they saved like crazy. Before I ""retired"", I managed to outright buy myself a 3 bedroom flat. I rented out the other rooms for a while but I got sick of having roommates, so now I have them up online for shorter stays, but not to rent.I met this guy about 18 months ago, and we've been together since. He knows about my employment history, and he said that he has no issue with it, though he did ask me to tell his family the white lie I occasionally use (on my CV and stuff), which is that I was a waitress (which I kind of was tbf).A month ago we found out that I'm 2 months pregnant. He says this is great news, and we should move in together. I assumed he'd be moving into my place because he rents his (far smaller 1 bedroom) flat while I own mine, and I have room for a baby's room while he doesn't. Also, I really don't want to leave my flat. It's my flat, I love it, I could see myself living here for the rest of my life, and I don't want to lose the security of owning a flat and have to go back to paying rent or a mortgage each month.However, he then said that he didn't want to move into my place, and said I should sell it and we buy a place together. I said that I like my place, it means a lot to me that I was able to buy it, and it represents years of working my arse off scrimping and saving. He then said that he understands all of that, but we should be living together by the time the baby comes and he didn't want to live in my flat. I asked him why not - it's a great flat, it's central to everything, it's spacious, it's got room for all his stuff, there's a daycare in the building (run/owned by another tenant) and a school 5 minute walk away, the list goes on - and he said that he didn't want to live in a flat that was bought with ""stripper money"".That really pissed me off, and I told him no fucking way am I selling my flat and that he never had an issue with my ""stripper money"" paying for this flat before now. I said I wasn't giving up the security of owning a home for someone who tries to make me feel ashamed about something I don't feel ashamed of. He said that his point is if I sold the flat then we could get a new place with the money from the sale. I said ""wouldn't that still be stripper money?"" and he said ""that's different"", and I asked how. He then said he was going back to his place because ""I can't talk to you when you're in this state"".He's gone back to his flat now and he's texted me saying I'm overreacting/irrational and I need to think of this realistically rather than emotionally. He says he wouldn't feel right raising a child in my flat knowing how I purchased it and selling/moving is the best idea of all of us, not to mention the fact he isn't on the deed because it's my place and it ""would never feel like our place"" because of this.I feel I might be the arse because I get why he might feel like it's just my place and I feel I'm being too rigid in a time we need to work together, plus I spoke to my sister and she sided with him so 2 out of 3 people think I'm in the wrong here.AITA?Update on the off chance anyone sees this: I dumped him. There was a whole conversation and during the conversation he said he didn't want to be a parent if I wasn't willing to do everything he wanted, including sharing a house/deed (plus staying together). Also, at the start of the conversation I said what a few people suggested, which was that I'd be willing to sell and split the house with him, provided he paid 50%, and he got very very angry, very very quickly. He also said a few other things, so IDK how it's all going to pan out just yet, but it looks like I'm going to be a single mother."
141,Not the A-hole,AITA for giving my wife an ultimatum about getting a dog?,28642,hreyxc,2770,"I had a dog when my wife and I got married. I loved her, she was my buddy. When my wife got pregnant, she became increasingly paranoid that the dog would be a danger to the baby. She brought up rehoming, and I refused. She was an ""aggressive breed"", but she was trained. One day, she called me crying at work that the dog ran away and she couldn't run after her. I believed her. I looked for that dog for weeks. I finally just accepted it because we had to go to the hospital to welcome our child and there were just other pressing concerns.It's been 5 years since then, and we now have three children. I've wanted to get a new dog, but the kids take a lot of energy and time. My wife has always had a new excuse not to get another dog. I found out recently that my dog didn't run away, my wife and her father took the dog to the pound while I was at work because her parents agreed with her about the dog being ""dangerous"".I'm FURIOUS. She was MY dog, my BABY. She wasn't dangerous. I would never have agreed to that. She probably never got adopted. I'm honestly mad enough to consider a separation if not for the kids and practical reasons. I've told her that the only way to make it up even a little bit is for us to get a dog. She ultimately doesn't want a dog at all, and complained that she would have to do too much with it. I'm not planning to let up on this one this time."
142,Not the A-hole,AITA For Offering A Drink To A Girl In A Bar And Then Not Paying For It?,28550,grrijp,2023,"I'm m23 and few months ago I was at a nice bar in Toronto with my boys and I saw this really hot girl. Decided to shoot my shot and we spoke and danced for a bit and I offered to buy her a drink and she gladly accompanied me to the bar, when I got there I was like can I have a beer and whatever she wants. She promptly says can I get 4 double shots of 1942. Thats like $75 a shot for a double of 1942 and I was like wtf and she said there for her friends and patted me on the back. When the bartender came back I slapped a $10 bill on the table and told him she'd be covering the shots and walked away. She was pissed and yelling the normal insults lol. Well it turns out my mom works with her and they were talking and my mom showed her a picture of me (god damn it mom!) and she instantly recognized me and remembered my name and told my mom about what I did. My mom then called me and said I'm a huge asshole and told me to send her the cost of the 4 drinks which was like $325 with tips. I just laughed and told my mom I'm not doing that and my mom said that the girl thinks I'm a huge asshole and douche and she agrees LOL. AITA?"
143,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my son that if he changes his last name then I’m no longer his Father?,28383,d9fawt,4383,"Let me start off by saying my son, Adam, is 22 years old. Back when my ex wife, Tori, and I were trying for kids we found out that I was infertile. We decided we’d adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. I was thrilled because I thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. No, I was wrong. My ex wife cheated on me and I didn’t find out until 20 years later. Tori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he’s not my biological son. My ex and I divorced a few weeks later. Ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological Father. He did and they started to become really close. It hurt me much more than I thought it would. He’s an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. They started to bond really well, and all of a sudden Adam became really distant from me. It’s been like this for almost a year and a half. I try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he’s busy with Chris (biological Father). I tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. We used to do stuff every other week but it’s been completely different since he found out about Chris.I couldn’t stand it. My son who I raised since he was a baby treated me like I didn’t matter. Any time we’d actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. What I mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. I’d ask him how classes or friends were and he’d just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. He also changed his major from Econ to Computer Science and didn’t even mention it to me until a year later. I told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he’d do better. He never did. I told him numerous times and he never changed. He was still distant.What was the final straw for me was the phone conversation I had with him last week. He said he was going to change his last name to Chris’ because he liked it so much and because they were close. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I told him this “I can’t believe you are going to do this. That’s really disappointing to me. If you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then I’m no longer your Father and I don’t want to be involved in your life.” He hung up on me. I didn’t even bother reaching out because I know he wouldn’t respond. I stand by what I said. I meant every word and still do. The last name change to me means he no longer views me as a Father and views Chris as his (despite the fact he’s 22).My family told me I’m being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it’s reasonable. I was told to post it here. So Reddit am I being an asshole?INFO: Something to add. After I found out about Chris I took a couple of days and didn’t speak to my ex wife or Adam. They didn’t contact me. I didn’t contact them. I needed a break.Edit 2: A lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and I think I finally figured out why he’s been so cold. A few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. His Grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that I am fully in charge of. Enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. After a semester of university he started dating this girl. He was head over heels in love with her. I never met the girl so I have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. Suddenly after a few months of dating Adam asked me for about $3K to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. I already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. I asked Adam why he needed the money. He said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. I told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. He spent over 1K on her in just under a few months. He would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. To me she was just after my son’s inheritance and I was right. What I said to him was basically this “Adam, you haven’t been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn’t sit well with me. That’s the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. If you 2 were more serious then I would think about it, but I’m not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend.” Turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. They broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. He was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. Then we found out about my ex’s affair. I don’t know if that’s the real reason he’s so cold. That was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him."
144,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling my ""nephew"" his ps4 was going to be destroyed to teach him a lesson?",28351,ek4u98,2406,"Ok. I fucked up.My brother-in-law saw one of those stupid videos where they destroy the video game console in front of the child to teach him a lesson. I heard him planning on doing that to my nephew because he failed 2 courses at school (he is 12). I tried talking them out of it, telling them that's not the way, sell it, hide it, whatever just don't do it.... that was my point.I told my nephew, what they were going to do, and asked him not to overreact, just tell them you are disappointed, or something that makes them feel bad, if he brings his grades up, I will get him a new PS4, but I want his stupid parents to feel guilty.Last week, my brother-in-law sat him a chair, have a couple of assholes friends holding him and proceed to destroy the ps4 with a baseball bat, while laughing and yelling and recording.My nephew had a poker face, did not move at all,  and whisper something and laughed. His dad stopped asked everybody to shut up and asked him, what? why are you laughing about?My nephew said: You humiliated me, you took something that was mine, and humiliated me in front of everybody.  You are bigger, stronger... but everybody is helpless when they are asleep. I am laughing because everybody is helpless when they are sleeping.... If you are done, I want to go inside, there something I need to think about.He had an entire week to prepare what to say, and this is what he came up with, and his delivery was fucking scary, I was speechless, everybody was shocked. I said out loud, good parenting everybody, good job, and went after my nephew.I spoke with my nephew afterward,  and he said that he will tell no one I had told him, and he has no plans on doing anything to his parents at all, he just wants to teach him a lesson as I suggested.Now, my sister book an appointment with a psychologist, they are sleeping with locks on their doors and caused a family crisis.And I feel like an asshole because I just have to tell them what I did to patch things, but honestly, I just want to see where this is going.&#x200B;Edit.I tried to answer as many comments as possible but I will provide some more context.1. My nephew told me he heard a similar line in a mafia movie, but he doesn't remember which, he told he wrote down some ideas to make the parents feel guilty and chose that one.2. it did happen. I am aware of how unbelievably bad-ass it sound. I share it because I was feeling guilty and because I was proud of my nephew's epic response.3. The father tried hiding the controller once to punish him, but he sneak a second controller he borrowed from a friend. They are not abusive parents all the time. They saw a video online, thought it will teach him a lesson. I disagree and thought it was outright traumatic since they didn't listen I thought to give my nephew a heads up.4. My sister is super paranoic. Her husband is concerned about his response, but not because he is afraid for his life. My sister is. Which makes things worse for me.5. I thought it was a fun thing to share, they are not bad people, they do weird stuff like taking pictures of my nephews and niece holding signs when they do something wrong (shame pictures), nothing physical, nothing really abusive, this was the first and for the looks the last time.6. I don't think there is much to update, they will go to therapy and most likely will patch things out. If something worth sharing or worthy of talking about, I will post it.7. yes, I feel very proud of my nephew. keeping it cool while it was happening it was way more than what I could have possibly expected.Edit 2In retrospective and after reading some comments, they really need therapy. When you see it every day it is hard to notice that some behavior could be toxic. I don't regret what I did, and definitely don't regret posting it here. Reddit can be really insightful sometimes. Thanks for your comments."
145,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not telling a vegan mom that the candy she stole from my kids and was eating, wasn’t vegan?",28315,joxhic,1946,"This happened on Halloween and the day following.My neighbor, 38F (super vegan) has 2 kids. I (26F) also have 2 kids. My apartment complex didn’t do traditional tick or treating on Halloween.Residents were advised to set out prepackaged individual candy bags on their patios/front door areas if they wanted to participate- but the traditional “knock on door, physically hand strangers candy” was not permitted.So, Halloween comes and the kids are all dressed up and each building has a scheduled time where the kids go door to door. I ended up having to work late so my neighbor offered to walk my kids around with hers at our buildings scheduled time. About 45 minutes later my kids came home with a small bucket of candy (6 little goodie bags each from individual apartments that participated) everything was fine, and my kids didn’t say anything weird had happened. They were just excited to eat candy once they got home lol.The next day I took my kids to the park directly across from our apartment complex. My neighbor was there with her kids as well. The kids were playing and she took out one of those individual goodie bags with candy in it from her purse and started to loudly rummage in it. She ate several pieces of candy and my daughter eventually noticed, ran up and asked if she could have a piece and my neighbor responded “nope, this is my tax candy, remember that This was my reward for taking you trick or treating last night” I was a little weirded out by that statement and asked what she meant.She said that since she Is the one who had to take the kids out, she took FIVE bags from each of my kids as a “tax.”Her son then chimes in and said “you only took two bags from us!” she responded with “but I’m your mom, I was doing OP a favor so they get a higher candy tax” I was thinking about how to respond when I noticed that she was holding a starburst candy and decided to just smile and nod and go back to watching my kids. I let her continue To finish off the bag of candy and then said “hey, aren’t you vegan? You know a lot of those candies are made with animal products right. “I explained what gelatin was and how a LOT of those candies are made with it.She was horrified, googles it and then told her kids that they were leaving. She said something about how she was going to be sick and stormed off. Now she’s giving me dirty looks every time we see her and won’t let her kids play if she shows up at the park and we are there.My husband thinks I’m an asshole cause I should have either- not said anything about the gelatin, or said something right away when I noticed. I don’t think it’s my job to tell a vegan what is and isn’t vegan though, and she deserved it for stealing candy from little kids.Edit #1 when we got home from the park after the gelatin incident, I sat my kids down and asked why they didn’t tell me that the neighbor took half of their candy. My oldest kid is six and my youngest kid is four. Six year old explained that as they went door-to-door during their designated trick-or-treating time she would have my four year old grab two bags instead of one from each apartment for the majority of them, she explained it to my kids that they were grabbing extra bags for her to be handed over at the end as taxation. So either freaking way she was directly taking candy from my kids or taking candy *from other kids through* mine. As for the authenticity of her vegansim- I may have exaggerated when I said “super vegan” when I first posted this. She claims to be vegan and is very, very in peoples faces about the benefits etc. it’s 100% about the health side- she brags about veganism curing cancer, diabetes, even some mental health issues. I have never once heard her talk about the benefits for animals. She also sells herbal tea products, customized gym clothing etc. so she totes a pretty big vegan “lifestyle” if that makes sense. Now for the gelatin. She knows what gelatin is, she knows what it’s made out of, she knows that there are obvious things that she can’t eat. But she had no idea that a lot of candy specifically had gelatin apparently. When I told her that they had gelatin in it, she knew what gelatin was but googled the candies to see if I was correct.I think she is either really dumb or she eats non vegan stuff all the time when no ones watching and had to pretend to be horrified about it at this point, cause a lot of you guys have pointed out that you literally can’t be vegan and not know these things. I’m not vegan, I’m not even freaking vegetarian and I know these things. About the starbursts: a lot of you have said that starburst are vegan friendly. However starburst in the USA are made with animal gelatin. In the UK they ARE vegan though! ;)EDIT #2 I cannot thank you guys enough for all the insight on this, and if it weren’t for you all commenting and me being able to show my husband, he probably wouldn’t have told me what was actually wrong. Turns out he was calling me an asshole cause she’s been parking in his assigned parking spot and giving him dirty looks since this happened. I had no idea because I work from home and haven’t used the car in days. He finally told me why he was so grumpy about what I did. He hates confrontation and was miss placing his anger at me. I’m gonna talk to her about it first, then management if it doesn’t stop. I also bought several bags of candy that our entire family has been snacking on since lol."
146,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking this girl out of my house after she mistook my UK flag for a confedrate flag? And was planning to get us fired from our jobs?,28114,iib8f9,2623,"So for a bit of background, we are all in our mid 20s and live in the USA. Me and two of my friends rent out a decent size house and we had a get together. My roommate is friends with these two girls call them Kate and Jess, and they invite with them a new friend call her Ashley. Now Ashley when she comes over I see that she is recording us, I thought she was just posting to her Instagram and Snapchat. I don't pay attention to any of it really. I notice that she is just video taping a lot, so I am like Kate can you check on your friend like whats going on? Turns out.. she thought that the UK flag we have hanging in our living room was a confederate flag. And she was getting ""Evidence against us."" When she found out that it wasn't everyone just acted like it was a huge joke. But I got pissed, like for real? you think we are racist, yet invite you over to our house, where you have our hospitality and our food/alcohol. In the meanwhile you are getting evidence to ruin our livelihoods? I don't want anyone like that in my house AT ALL. So I make a scene and get her to leave. Kate and Jess say it was just a misunderstanding. I was like no there wasn't ts the principle behind it. Some of our friends have came to Ashley's side but I don't see how you can support her."
147,Not the A-hole,AITA for being mad that my birthday gift was sex?,28104,anhw1b,2225,"On my gf's birthday I gave her a necklace that I spent $400 on.  I wasn't expecting her to spend the same as me, but I was expecting something.Here's how it went down.  After dinner she asked me if I was ready for my gift, I said yes and she started giving me oral.  She doesn't like giving oral and I'm ok with it.  She was giving bad oral and honestly I just wanted her to stop, then she gets up and pulls me into my room and we have sex.I feel disappointed.   I don't think sex is a gift.  I didn't expect a gift that was equal to what I spent, but I wanted a least something."
148,Not the A-hole,AITA for naming my child the same name that SIL named hers just weeks earlier?,28096,hn91mz,1622,"My SIL has never liked me. She had always tried to one up me. We were both pregnant at the same time. Her due date was 6 days after mine but her girl came early so she gave birth roughly 2 weeks before me. We had already announced our name because MIL wanted to make a blanket with baby's name in it.SIL said their name was a secret. Well turns out they named their daughter the name we chose and announced. She thought she had won and I decided it wasn't worth arguing with her. I gave birth and we simply went ahead with our name choice. It's a generic name like Sara or Anna but it's was also my mum's name which is why we chose it. So technically SIL could have planned for this name all along but I doubt it.Well, she's not happy at all that the two cousins now share a name. I told her tough luck and why did she think we'd change our name?"
149,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my wife that the only reason she says 'money doesn't matter' is because we're rich?,28089,ktuqop,2147,"I (48M) and my wife (47F) both have very well paying jobs. I am a Pediatric Doctor and she's an Attorney, which have allowed us and our kids (20F), (17M) and (15M) to have a more than comfortable lifestyle. My wife has a tendency to say things like 'Money doesn't matter' and that 'material things don't matter' and she says them all the time, which kinda irks me because she's right, but I was raised in a poor family, and I know that she wouldn't be saying the same thing if we were middle-class. But I haven't said anything up until this morning. I had made a comment about needing a better watch, and my wife was saying her usual 'money doesn't matter'. I told her that she was only saying that because we are rich and because she has never experienced being without money in any sense. Predictably, she got upset with me, and now I'm wondering if perhaps I overreacted and went too far."
150,Not the A-hole,AITA for forcing my tomboy daughter to wear formal clothing?,28046,il24rf,2116,"Hi all. My family is Indian-American, but I like to think I am pretty progressive. I (40F) have a son (16M) and a daughter (15F). My daughter has started to become a tomboy over the last 2 years, despises feminine clothing and style. While it has definitely been an adjustment in my perception, I have always tried to be as supportive as possible, and have let her pick her own clothings, only eliminating anything that was graphic or inappropriate.However, my niece was getting married in a traditional, big Indian wedding. While generally all the girls would be wearing formal lehangas (Indian traditional dresses), I dropped it after asking my daughter if she wanted to wear that and she said no (only mentioned it once because she really looks up to my niece and I did not want her to feel left out). When I asked her what she wanted to wear, she said that should wear a t-shirt and slacks.But, I insisted that she wear a formal clothing of her choice, whether it was a suit, a dress or traditional indian clothing. This was black tie event. I was making my son wear a formal suit. Everyone was going to be dressed to the nines. I was going to get my son a new suit tailored for the event, and I insisted that she come with and pick a fabric and suit style as well. It could be to her desire (as long as it was appropriate); like a very typical men's suit or feminine twist like what Zendaya wears.She got angry and said I was constricting her expression. I think she will have to wear formal clothing in other points in her life, whether for work or other formal events. She can express herself however she wants but dressing appropriately for the occasion is a necessary skill. The wedding has been postponed for now, but I still want her to wear a formal outfit and she is still mad at me about this. AITA?EDIT: Wow, I did not expect this to blow up like this haha! Thank you for the comments and messages! While some of you have labeled me as the asshole, I think a lot of you are saying that I am not which is good to hear. But, I want to stress that I don't think my daughter is really the asshole (a little right now) but she is the sweetest little girl in the world (I might be biased haha). She is usually  very respectful, gets excellent grades and works really hard. I am very proud of her.Some of you have mentioned there is an underlying problem that I am not seeing. I do not think my daughter is trans, but I think I have made it clear that its okay if she or anyone else is. She also generally seems pretty happy with her body; she is actually really fashionable and doesn't really wear baggy clothing or anything, but is more into ""streetwear."" She is the one who showed me who Zendaya is! Are there additional signs I should be looking for or things I should be doing?I think she is at the stage in life where she knows everything, and I, her mom, knows nothing. She wants to rebel for something, but isn't really the type to rebel with something really bad (thank god), so she decided this is a justified area to rebel. She is also at home, and I haven't really allowed her to go out because of the current circumstances; so think she feels cooped up and now everything about me is annoying her.That being said, a lot of you said to tell her she can't go to the wedding if she doesn't wear formal clothing, and I may be the asshole here, but SHE IS GOING. That is a thing I have decided to take a hard stance on. (1) because my daughter really, really wants to go! She loves her cousin and my family, and she is a really social person who would love weddings. Telling her not to go would hurt her I think and would be counterproductive in the longterm. (2) This is the first  wedding in our family and the first time my kids will see a traditional Indian wedding. They have never seen one before, so I think its important that they learn and feel connected to our culture. (3) If she decides not to go as an act of rebellion, I know my daughter, and I know she will feel really, really sad afterwards.Parenting is hard, and I was always a girly-girl and so were all the people around me, so this uncharted territory for me. Thank you to all of you for your kind words and encouragement."
151,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling a guy with autism off because he wouldn’t stop talking about something he knows nothing about?,28026,hv5qaz,2469,"I (29f) am three years into my PhD. I have published many papers and been a co author of even more. I've done field studies and teach at a uni. Basically, I know my field.I speak a few langues and teach a group of people outside of work. We meet up once a week and talk in that language. We are all friends and it's very casual. Last week one person of the group asked if they could bring a mate (K) from work who's interested in the language too. She said that her mate is on the spectrum and that he might not know when to stop talking. I said bring him along and we'll see how he fits in.The actual lesson went well and I think we were all happy. Usually some people stick around for a bit after and we just have a few drinks. This is when it started. As it turns out K is interested in my field of study. He asked me some questions and I was happy to answer. But then it started getting weird. He kept arguing with me and ""correcting"" me, telling me what I apparently misunderstood and so on. It was quite awkward and my other friends tried to gently let him know that he was probably out of line. He kept asking me about my opinion on studies and papers but in an aggressive almost questioning way. The last straw was when he told me that I misinterpreted the findings of a study that I was a co author of. I was sick of it and said ""listen buddy, I know you think that you know everything about this field but if you had actually bothered to read who ""et al"" is then you'd know that I wrote this fucking paper so please just shut up"" not my proudest moment I admit but at this point he'd been trying to ""beat me"" for over 30 minutes. He left after that but later messaged me that he'd inform my uni of my discriminatory behaviour towards people with autism.Now I'm wondering if I went too far.Edit typo"
152,Not the A-hole,AITA for giving my son a bill for half his expenses?,28004,iyl5pm,1986,"My son (17) asked me for a new gaming system and I said no because he already has plenty of gaming systems and games and doesn’t need more. If he wants one he can save up and buy one.He then comes to me with a budget on how we can “afford” the system. It was mostly just that if I buy nothing for myself for 2 months, we’ll have enough for the system. I told him hell no, it’s offensive and if he wants the system he has to save up for it.Then he comes back with another budget. He and his father calculated how much I’ve been paid in child support over the years and they decided it would be a good idea to let me know how little a drop in the bucket the gaming system would be. I told him I spend that on his expenses every month but he didn’t believe me, so I told him that if he doesn’t think so, he can pay me for his expenses every month and I’ll give him the child support.Surprise surprise, when I gave him the bill, it showed that when you factor in all of the things I pay for in a month, it’s much more than child support. Child support doesn’t even cover 30%. Now my ex is yelling at me for making our son feel like an expensive burden, but I think I was teaching him a lesson about money and unteaching him some of what my ex says about support. AITA for giving him a bill?ETA: not able to comment, but just wanted to say this isn’t a question of being able to afford the console. I can afford it, but that doesn’t mean he should just get it."
153,Not the A-hole,AITA for turning the home I inherited into an Airbnb? My sister thought it would be a “family home” forever.,27917,cevstm,3439," I will try to keep it very short so as to not bore anyone. About six months or so ago my grandpa died. For simplicity sake, let’s say hi estate is worth about $1.5 million. In his will he said that me, my sister and my cousin each get 1/3 share.  His estate was basically two cash amounts and the other share was his beach home in California. Basically the oldest got to pick which they wanted, the second oldest and the youngest which was me. MI got the beach house, my sister and cousin got $500k. For the last six months I’ve allowed my sister to stay in the house whenever she likes but I just got my first tax bill and I either have to sell it or start making some income off it. After talking to the real estate agent I’ve decided the best course of action is to put it on Airbnb. That way I can still use it if I like, but sister can pay me to use it if she still wants to go there, basically there’s not someone renting full-time. My sister is furious with me for so many reasons, first of all I know she’s upset because she can no longer use the house for free. But she’s also telling me that I basically becoming a rent seeking capitalist who is going to ruin the neighborhood which has been a total classic surf neighborhood since the 1950s. She has written me angry email after angry email after angry email calling me all sorts of names. She also says it’s not fair because her inheritance is gone for her debts but I still make money from mine, and that if she had chose the house I could stay there any time I want.  She’s my older sister and I’ve always been impressionable to the things she says to me and I’m feeling a lot of guilt and shame for what she told me. Am I the asshole here?"
154,Not the A-hole,AITA for being honest with my nephew about where I was for most of his life?,27901,cgq9zs,2195,"Okay, let me just get right into this. I [27M] was kicked out at 16 because my older sister [37F] outed me to my parents as gay. They completely cut off all contact with me and I didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and Mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. When I was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. For the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. A couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and I ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. He asked me why I wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. I asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. I told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until I eventually confessed I was cut off for being gay. He made a face and asked how my parents even found out. I told him I was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that I don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. He got a bit quiet and changed the subject. I got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that I'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by ""pretending they're bad people"" and ""making up false homophobia accusations"". I explained to her that I didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and I think he's old enough to deserve honesty. She just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. I'm crushed because obviously I love the kid. Did I do the wrong thing? Should I have lied or refused to talk about it or lied to him or something?"
155,Not the A-hole,AITA For not punishing my daughter for mocking her cousin?,27876,k2seky,2524,"My wife and her younger sister are best friends. As a result, when our middle daughter and her cousin were born around the same time, my wife really expected them to also be best friends. With sixteen years of hindsight, I can say with certainty that the expectation was misplaced. Nothing happened in particular. My daughter just doesn't like her cousin. My wife keeps pushing the relationship. This includes making my daughter spend time with her cousin during family gatherings, inviting her cousin on trips, forcing my daughter to call her. We're pretty sure I'm the favorite parent (a fact that keeps my ego well-inflated), and, therefore, my apathy towards the situation is not well-received by my wife. From my perspective, this isn't important, and I do not possess the ability to make two teenagers become friends. I'm also pretty sure that trying to push this kind of knuckleheaded stuff makes kids not want to speak to you. This is where I'm probably an asshole. Yesterday, my wife forced my daughter to video call her cousin. My daughter rejected to request, and my wife told her: ""Unless you have a valid reason for disliking your cousin, you will do this because we're family"". The call occurred. This morning, we awoke to a PowerPoint presentation titled *Valid Reasons to Dislike \[Cousin\].* Using clips from the zoom call, segments included *Why is \[Cousin's\] Voice so Grating? A Music Theory Approach, A Case Study: Conversations That Provide No Value*, *Rethinking the Idea That There Are No Dumb Questions*, ect. With the benefit of a couple of hours of hindsight, it was a very cruel takedown of her cousin's entire personality. My wife was furious. My eldest daughter and I lost our shit laughing. My wife is demanding I support her in punishing my daughter for bullying her cousin. I have refused because I feel this is whole situation wouldn't have occurred if she didn't push the relationship, but I'm starting to have second thoughts because it was very mean. AITA?"
156,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking my boyfriend's parents out of our apartment after his mom called me a bitch?,27862,gon4bm,1758,"Back in March his parents decided they wanted to come ""wait quarantine out"" at our apartment. For starters they never asked. His mother called and TOLD me that they were on their way and to prepare our spare bedroom for them. I was already apprehensive about them staying with us because his parents have always been EXTREMELY rude to me. They are overly critical of everything I say and do. They are massive control freaks who feel entitled to always be in charge. So right off the bat things are miserable. They verbally abuse me daily, tell me what I can and can't do in my own apartment, and are overall just the WORST. Out of everything, the air conditioning caused the biggest debacle. Where I live it has been 85-90 almost every day. I normally keep my air on 70, but when they started complaining, I turned the air up to 75. This is already a little toasty for me, but I was willing to be a little hot to try to keep the peace. This was not good enough for them. They don't want the air on. Period. They want the HEAT on. And they turn it on every single opportunity they get. I wake up in the middle of the night covered in sweat. I have told them to stop COUNTLESS times. Yesterday I finally cracked. I put about 10 pieces of duct tape over the thermostat with a note attached that said ""Do NOT touch the thermostat while I am at work"". 6pm I walk into my apartment and am automatically HIT by a hotter and more humid heat than it is OUTSIDE. Duct tape and note have been torn off the thermostat and they have the heat on 98 fucking degrees. I go into the guest room and say ""Why could you not follow the simple instruction of DO NOT TOUCH THE THERMOSTAT. This is my home. I am tired of you saying rude things to me. I am tired of you treating me like a child and creating your own rules for MY apartment. You either need to be respectful towards me and learn to accept my boundaries or go back to your own house."" His mother said and I disdainfully quote, ""You have no right to barge in here without knocking. That was not only an invasion of privacy but you need to take the attitude out of your tone. I've dealt with much bigger bitches than you before."" She went on for 30 minutes and I just tuned her out. When she was done talking I told her to get out. Now my boyfriend is angry with me because I couldn't just let them have their way. He wants me to call his mom and apologize but I don't think I should have to. I may have been rude to her, but it was only because I have spent the past two months dealing with her abuse and trying to politely ask her to stop treating me that way. I got tired of politely asking someone to stop treating me like shit in my own home in which I was letting them live in for free. I also got tired of my boyfriend refusing to defend me and allowing her to say and do whatever she wanted. I am trying to understand their perspective although it just doesn't seem reasonable to me. If Reddit determines I am the asshole, I will call and apologize."
157,Not the A-hole,AITA for not using my daughter's college fund for my stepson's rehab?,27867,kfi8io,2965,"The title basically sums it up, I suppose. My husband and I have been married for three years now, I have a daughter (15F) and he has a son (24M). I am friendly with my stepson, but we aren't close. He has a biological mother who is a perfectly fine woman, I'm not here to take the role of his mom. My late husband (my daughter's father) died when my daughter was 6, we both contributed to her college fund. My daughter's paternal grandparents have also contributed a large amount. Right now, the fund has about $180,000. My daughter is extremely bright, and I'm not just saying that because I'm her mom. I truly believe she has the capacity to go to an Ivy league school, and her teachers have said she has the potential as well, and I don't want costs to hold her back. Our income would be too high to get any meaningful financial aid, and while there are a few merit based scholarships out there that she will be applying too, we don't want to put all our eggs in one basket and hope she gets it when it's so competitive. My current husband and I have separate finances, he doesn't contribute at all to my daughter's fund.My stepson is struggling with a heroin addiction, and has stolen money, jewelry, hierlooms, and electronics from us for drug money. I understand that addiction is a disease, and I personally paid for an outpatient detox for him, which cost $1000, which failed. His father then paid for an outpatient rehab program, which cost $6500, which also didn't work because he barely showed up. He promised us he'd do better next time and he needed another chance, so I split the cost of another $6500 outpatient rehab program with my husband, which seemed to work during program, but he relapsed as soon as he got out of it. I have spent so much money, time, and energy and it hasn't helped at all.My husband and my stepson want to try a 60-day inpatient rehab program, which will cost $30,000. I had absolutely no idea where they were supposed to get the money for that, considering the thousands and thousands of dollars that were already spent, and the fact that we no longer had anything of value in our house. They want to use my daughter's college fund, which to me is absolutely off-limits. I feel like it's completely unfair to my daughter to punish her for my stepson's addiction, unfair to my late husband and his parents, but frankly, I don't think spending $30,000 will work. My husband thinks I'm an asshole because I'm prioritizing my daughter's education over his son's life, and he believes medical needs come first. He then asked my daughter if she'd be willing to use $30,000 from her fund to pay for her stepbrother's rehab, and she got very quiet and did not answer. He then got very upset with her and said she was being selfish. My daughter later told me that she didn't want to give her stepbrother the money, but she felt so guilty, and I am furious at my husband for emotionally guiltripping my daughter like that."
158,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I refused to attend my cousins wedding after she asked me to dye my ginger hair?,27845,ezb2co,2854,"Yes I'm aware that my cousin posted here and oh the irony as i showed her this sub last year, but I really don't care if she sees this,  maybe it'll hammer the point home. And I doubt she will see it as they are currently on their pre wedding honeymoon, legit didn't even know those were a thing. So Amy is getting married,  she has a blue and green and purple theme for the wedding. People are supposed to wear these colours including the moh and the bridesmaids. What irked me about that post was that my hair is NOT FLAMING MERIDA RED.maybe slightly more [ginger] ( in low lightThis whole thing is completely insane to me and I have no idea where it has come from.My [hair]( [2]( [3]( is what i would describe as strawberry blonde, maybe ginger blonde. Those are actual picture's of my hair not some poor stranger's instagram.Things have been awkward from the start with Amy demanding that everyone has to stick to this dress code or they will be barred by security at the damn door.She has also asked anyone with hair past their waist to cut it in a Facebook post but it got no replies and I can't think of anyone except me and maybe my sister with suoer long hair.My mum and dad are both way more ginger than me and my sister who is 8 months pregnants hair is not much shorter than mine and is super ginger, and Amy never asked her to touch her hair? if anything I got the dull hair geane.At first Amy called up to tell me she had made a post here,  I took a look and had to laugh to be honest,  She linked me early on clealry thinking people would agree with her but she said she was worried because it blew up. After things went south she decided to try and ""negotiate"" with me, still completely bizzare as my hair is not merida red.My mum and dad called round a few days back to talk about it but got absolutely nowhere with her as she's still insisting i dye my hair a dark brown for the day or get a wig. My aunt,  Amy's mom called to apologise to me and asked me to please come but I don't feel welcome, can you imagine attending a wedding where the bride stares daggers at you the whole time? and what if the security refuse to let me in. [these]( are extremely similar to the gowns the bridesmaids are going to wear, I've tired mine on and it absolutely dose not clash at all.I brought and paid for my dress so I don't owe her anything but our families are so upset that I'm dropping out. But if I go I have no choice except to dye my hair as there never was a compromise or middle ground,  it was dye it,  buy a short brown bob wig or don't come. She specified it has to be a short brown bob wig for some reason.WIBTA if I just say fuck it and stay home.EDIT  also to be fair i dyed a small strand underneath to test how it washed out 4 weeks ago, it is STILL DARK BROWN"
159,Not the A-hole,AITA for walking out after a boss tried to refuse to accept my resignation?,27841,j5o8e8,1561,"I had a boss who was a real turd. He labored under the delusion he was an excellent boss and couldn’t put together that his behavior and the crappy pay was why he had such a hard time keeping employees. He also thought it was acceptable to call his female employees hun, sweetie, and sugar. He was a condescending asswipe who consistently passed over more qualified women for promotions in favor of promoting less qualified men. I had to stay until I could find a better job because I enjoy eating, and couldn’t afford to leave unless I had something else. I got an interview with a competitor who hired me on making more than I made with him. I turned in my two weeks and he said “oh sweetie, you know you can’t leave.” I said I absolutely am leaving. He got the smuggest look on his face and said “Well, I’m not accepting this, sugar. Guess you’re here to stay.” I got so furious and decided that was it. I said “well screw this then, I quit. Effective immediately.” Called my new job, explained what happened in front of him as he sat there slack jawed and agreed start the next day. I packed my stuff and left. A former coworker said it was an asshole thing for me to just up and quit on the spot, but if he refused to accept the resignation he could easily have tried to screw me over when my last day did come. My new boss says he deserved it and I’m not the asshole for quitting like I did. My boyfriend says he can see how other employees might feel like I was an asshole by making them cover my absence, but sees how I’m not the asshole for walking out of that toxic environment. So just because I’m curious, I thought I’d ask here. AITA?"
160,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not allowing my ""disabled"" neighbor to park in my driveway and getting her car towed, despite the previous owner allowing it?",27835,j21f5l,3748,"I bought a house a few months ago and moved in last month. The previous owner was a friendly old man that could no longer live alone so he decided to sell and move in with his daughter. Just to be clear I put disabled in quotation marks because the lady in question is just really really overweight and I am not sure if that counts as disabled.Now apparantly he had been allowing use of his driveway to his ""disabled"" neighbor lady largely because street parking is extremely limited and what little street parking there is, is pretty much instantly occupied. What I am saying is unless you have a driveway you end up having to park a good 5 minute walk away and that's the best case scenario.Obviously I was unaware of this so I was surprised to see a large SUV parked in my driveway when I moved in. I ended up having to knock on several doors asking who's car it was because the movers could not stand still on the busy road too long. I figured out it was the neighbors car so after a good 10 minutes of knocking an extremely angry enormous lady opened the door. I told her to move the car and she immediatly started arguing that the neighbor said it was fine, I told her he moved out, I moved in and no it is not fine and to move it because the movers need to unload my stuff. She begrudgingly did, I ended up seeing her walking back  half an hour later completely wet with sweat.Now a few days later I went back to work and lo and behold, the SUV is parked in my driveway again. I go over there again, spend 20 minutes knocking on the door before this lady opens the door, agaon, visibly angry. I tell her to move her car, my driveway is not public parking. She protests saying her ankles can't take walking the distance and claims I can easily walk, I tell her that while that might be true, it's my goddamn driveway and I want to park there myself. Again she moves her car, again I spot her half an hour later drenched in sweat making her way home.Well it happened again a week ago and this time she would not open her door, I got tired of it and had her SUV towed. She of course came to my house to scream at me, I told her to get the hell of off my property. A few days later I had a small fence installed with a lock on it to make sure it did not happen again.I have since been getting dirty looks from her and one other neighbor and when I told my mom she told me I should be nicer to people. I do feel sort of bad too, she clearly struggles with the walk after all."
161,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my mom to not have any more kids?,27829,g95klk,1882,"   I(16F) live with my parents and 11 siblings. I'm the 4th kid, and the ages range from 20 to 1. We live in a 4 bedroom house, but it is so cramped with everyone in bunks and no privacy. My parents also put most of the responsibility of the younger kids on us while they lay down and watch TV. True, they can have their breaks but they take them so often that I don't really get to be a teenager.    Last night, after my mom told me to but J+A(3) to bed, I told her to do it herself as I need to study. She said that it is my responsibility as an older child. I lost my temper and told her that she can't take care of her 12 kids as it is, and that she should give up her dream of 15 children because she’s depriving the younger ones of a better life. AITA?TL;DR My mom has 12 kids and wants 15, and I lost my temper and said that she shouldn’t have any more because she can’t take care of all of them as it is."
162,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my drywall guy to stop bugging my babysitter?,27833,hip54w,2215,"We are doing some house renovations and so workers are in the house. Today two guys were putting up drywall in the living room while our babysitter is playing with our daughter in the family room while I’m working in my downstairs office. I hear the drywall guy asking personal questions to my babysitter until her answers started getting short and her tone changes. IE: Guy: So where do you live ? Her: North of hereGuy: Yeah but where?Her: It’s kind of a weird spotThat’s when I finally walked upstairs and told him, “What is this? The census? She’s watching my kid. Let her be. “ I thought I did it in a joking manner but I guess it came off harsher than I intended. My wife promptly informed me I was an asshole to the guy and the babysitter had it under control. I get that white knighting is a thing and that I may be out of touch with where I should be putting my foot down so I leave the verdict all of you. Am I the A-hole?Update: We spoke about the situation at just before she left. I apologized to her for the weirdo and let her know he won’t be back. To quote her, “The thirsty ones never get the hint.”The most eye opening take away from this  was when she told my wife and I, “If you think that was bad you should check out my DM’s”. Her instagram messages are from people who should be put on the sex offender registry. Guys offering her $700 a week to hold them, guys she has never met offering to buy her plane tickets, and straight up dick pics. How are dick pic people not out on the sex offender registry? It’s just street flashing with less effort. It’s insane and it’s apparently just a norm with the way she brushed it off. My wife is deflecting from whether I’m still the a-hole but I’ll take what I can get. In her defense, even the babysitter noted that while my comment was funny, my tone was actually straight up yelling at the guy. It’s a give and take like anything in this world. Anyway, thank you all for your input and here is to hoping the “thirsty” ones get a job which has them work from home and off social media."
163,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking out my dad and his pregnant wife out of the home I legally own after they sent my depressed sister to live with our aunt?,27748,fiq5ta,1475,"My mother passed away 3 years ago. The family home, where I and my sister grew up, was willed to me. It was her ancestral property, and she wanted her daughter to have it. The other vacation home went to my 16 year old sister.Our father remarried 6 months after mom passed away and moved his new wife in. My sister says that that woman has removed all of our family pictures from the main living area. She has removed our mom's pictures as well. Now all of these pictures adorn the walls of my sister's room.Recently our father and his wife announced that they were pregnant with twins. My sister didn't take it well. She's still not over mom's death and had a breakdown after the announcement.The night of my sister's 16th birthday party, she brought a lot of friends over and the party went on till the next morning.My dad's wife, who was out with our father on vacation returned the same morning and lost her cool when she saw the kids passed out on the living room. Our dad knew about the party, they just got home earlier than expected.His wife proceeded to lose her cool and had a big shouting match with my sister. She said that my sister was just like our mom and was a burden on our dad. She then asked her to leave and sent her packing to our aunt's.I was furious when I got to know about it. I showed up home the next day and asked them to leave within a week. She's 7 months pregnant and had no idea that the house belonged to me. I know I shouldn't be kicking a pregnant woman out but I don't want my spineless father and his wife to abuse my sister anymore.My father called me a cruel brat and now wants to challenge our mom's will. He can try, my mom's family has already appointed their family lawyer to fight my case.AITA?"
164,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking my girlfriend out of my place on New Year’s Eve for scaring my little brother?,27714,kok683,2672,"We can all agree 2020 was a shit year. Particularly for my (29m) family. We lost our dad beginning of the year after he had a heart attack and my little brother (12) had no one to take care of him. Our mom died when he was 3 so our dad was all we had left.  I fought for custody and was appointed his legal guardian.Honestly it hasn’t been easy. We’re still adjusting to these life changes and my brother is taking it the hardest. For months he was just not himself. Bad attitude, lashing out. I got him in therapy because I knew he was just hurting, plus stress of pandemic.His behavior has improved so much since then, even if sometimes there’s days where he’s withdrawn.Days before Christmas he was feeling sad since it was our first holiday w/o dad. That day, he asked to be left alone. We had a talk to discuss his feelings and I gave him his space after that.My girlfriend was over that day and I went out to buy groceries. When I got back my brother was out of his room and helping out. I didn’t think anything of it at the time.Yesterday my brother and I were out having some guy time before going back home to get ready for NYE. My brother opened up about how grateful he is for everything and he hopes that I don’t change my mind about taking care of him. I asked why he’d think that and he told me what happened.That day when I was out my GF went to his room to tell him he needs to change his attitude and stop moping (her exact words)because he should be grateful I’m taking care of him at all. And that we can still hand him over to the state if we wanted to. I was furious about this and had to reassure him that was never gonna happen because he really was worried about it. We went home, I confronted my GF and she didn’t deny it. She told me it’s true and there was nothing wrong with telling him to stop acting like that when he should be grateful I “gave up my life” to take care of him. And the thing about giving him up isn’t that big of a deal to her because it’s not like I’ll actually do it.I said she still scared him with that threat and told her to leave my apartment because honestly, I was far too mad and because I didn’t want her to be near him right now. She started crying, there was more fighting but she left in the end. It was just me and my brother for New Years.Since last night I’ve been bombarded with calls from all our friends for kicking her out knowing she has no family and nobody else to spend the holiday with. Everyone has sided with her and even my best friend says I may have overreacted by making her leave when she probably thought she was helping. They’ve heard my side of the story but still think I was an ass for making her cry and spending the new year alone. I’m having trouble seeing how I could be so here I am looking for internet strangers to weigh in on this.UPDATE: OK wow this has gotten a TON of feedback. Thanks everyone for your kind and encouraging words. I might not have replied to a lot of the comments that made me smile but just know that I read an appreciate them! I know I only posted this a few hours ago but I’ve had a day to clear my head and really think about this. I talked to my brother because I wanted to know if she’s said anything else to him. Thankfully she hasn’t and we had another serious chat to remind him everything she told him is completely false. I would never in a million years give him up and that shouldn’t have been put in his head. Another thing I told him was that I’m grateful he’s here with me. Without him I wouldn’t have made it through the year and I thanked him for giving me that strength to keep going. Someone who DM’d me suggested reassuring him that he’s not somehow “ruining” my life incase he feels any guilt for what she told him. Thank you for that suggestion!Now, I know you were all waiting on this news. Yes, I did break up with her. Thinking about what a lot of you said, talking to my brother about how this made him feel, and my own thoughts about how badly she acted, I decided that’s not someone I want around me or him. I can’t risk her doing something like this again and ruining any progress he makes in therapy. I know many of you think I should’ve done it on the spot, but I wanted to make this decision with a clear head and not when my emotions were extremely high. She came by my place earlier and we talked outside. Her reaction was as bad as you’d expect and she STILL believed she did nothing wrong, even after I explained it all to her. There was just no making her understand and I told her it was over. I gave her a couple of her things that were lying around my apartment and she left. My phone started going off like an hour later so I had to put it on Do Not Disturb. That’s all the drama I could handle for one night. I’ll deal with my friends some other time. Honestly, I’m exhausted. Mentally and emotionally drained right now. I think this weekend we’ll do something  to get our minds off this. I definitely need it after everything and I know my brother does too. It’s been a hard year already without all this extra drama. Anyways sorry for the really long update you guys but I didn’t want to leave anyone hanging. I’m sure more comments will keep coming. I probably won’t be sleeping much tonight so I’ll keep my mind busy by reading and replying to more of you. Thanks again for the support! What a shitty way to start the new year but here’s hoping for better things :)"
165,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my grandparents about my stepsiblings destroying my jewelry?,27707,i1hgsb,1798,"My mother died when I was 10. My father married a goyishe woman less than a year later, who promptly did her best to have as many children as she could, and had 3 in as many years. She has two older kids too, who are 8 and 7 now. 6 kids is a lot, but it's a pretty big house. I'm the only grandchild on my mother's side, and the only granddaughter on either side. My grandparents typically gift me jewelry, and I got my mother's collection when she died. As a religious custom, we don't really do costume jewelry. All of my jewelry is real and not cheap. It sounds vulgar, but my entire jewelry collection is worth about 100k easily. I came home from seeing a friend and the oldest three had a PILE of my jewelry on the floor of their playroom. They had been jumping on it, smashing it and shooting at it with BB guns (yeah, my father allows that apparently). I screamed and got my father, who came with his wife and dismissed the entire thing.  They destroyed multiple pieces, several of which were heirloom. My stepmother didn't really care. She pretended to yell at her brats. She later came home with a dollar store necklace that she ""made"" the kids get me and said that that should be enough and that I shouldn't have such ""idols"" or wear such ""sacrilegious crap"" (one of my necklaces is a star of david). I saw red at that. I got her to repeat it so I could record it. I emailed all of my grandparents, aunts and uncles detailing what happened, attaching the recording and pictures of the damage, and then I went to those brats' playroom and destroyed one of each of their favorite toys. My grandparents are now suing my stepmother for $50,000 and half of my family now hates her. My father is furious and thinks that I should have kept it within the family and let him ""work it out""."
166,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling the judge of a scholarship competition that if she already knew who she wanted to win, to cut the crap and just let us all go home?",27692,f0rue1,1190,"I'm in high school, we had a final presentation before winter break, and we had judges from the community come in to reward the best presentations. Like not actual court room judges, just people who were involved in stuff locally. The prize was some scholarship money for college. Our classrooms judge was a mom who in the school board and when we were doing the presentations she was showing really obvious favoritism to her daughter's best friend who i know is tight with that family. I know her presentation wasn't even her own, it was plagarized a lot and not very good, I saw her doing it in the computer lab days earlier.It was annoying how the ""outside judge""kept going back to coo over this one presentation even after everyone had moved on and other people had presented. It was super awkward, like she was praising this one girl after a different kid had just presented?? Like maybe pay attention to the person who's at the podium, not your little favorite??It was my turn but I'd already seen her phoning it in when watching the last few, playing on her phone even! Not paying attention. I felt like it was pretty obvious she'd already decided who would would win. And that frustrated me, I'd worked really hard on mine and if her behavior is in the last few presentations was gonna continue, I knew she wouldn't even be listening.So I went up and said ""Look, we all know you already know who you're gonna give the prize to, we've all seen you play on your phone and ignore everyone who came after your daughters best friend, so can we just cut the crap and go home? I'm not gonna stand up here and give a presentation to someone who's disrespecting our efforts and playing on their phone when anyone who's not a friend of your family is talking.""She sure paid attention then, and went to talk to my teacher in a whisper. My teacher sent me to the principal's office. The girl I expected to win, won... No surprise there. But I felt good I'd at least said something. A bunch of my friends in class said I was totally right when I called out that BS, and we all knew it, I wasn't saying anything we didn't all see.My principal kept telling me that it didn't seem like I was taking my college apps seriously and I said that I didn't think I'd be going to college, I got stuck with debt already and I'm gonna need a job right away this spring. Anyway I got detentionAITA for saying what I did instead of doing my final presentation for the project?Edit - I just found out that the girl who got the scholarship money decided to decline it and give it to the student who had the best grade in the class. I don't know if it was because I called stuff out and she felt guilty, but I think it might be."
167,Not the A-hole,"AITA for calling my body-positive co-worker ""unhealthy, deluded, and bitter"" after some rude comments she made about me?",27616,d31cjt,371,"I'm currently working part-time at a restaurant on my university's campus. I mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'Anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. She embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. Personally, I have nothing against this at all. I am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. However, I do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. I don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  However, despite being a ""supporter,"" Anna regularly comments on my body type. For example, I always bring food for my shifts since I personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). Anna will often say things like, ""You should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!"" or ""You look skinnier than last week. I told you to stop eating salads everyday haha."" She'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if I was ""struggling with my weight"" and then proceed to tell me that I look ""way too skinny to be healthy."" One time I was changing into my work shirt in the back and Anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to ""look like a man's."" I have no idea what that even means but I doubt it was a compliment.These hypocritical comments have pissed me off. I enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and I enjoy working out and staying toned. Anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. I don't think this is healthy. Finally, during yesterday's shift, this guy I kinda like came in to get some food and I was super excited to see him. He turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. Oh well. Anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, ""Maybe he's into curvier girls."" I basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. I asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. Then I told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (I called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. She called me insecure and told me I was being a rude bitch. It was reaching the end of our shift so I clocked out early and left so I didn't have to argue with her more. I was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. She said that I was right and all but that I was insensitive in the way I brought it up and suggested that I apologize. I'm standing my ground but want to hear other opinions as well."
168,Not the A-hole,AITA for giving away my grandparents’ gift intended for my fiancé,27621,klazu5,2274,"Every year, my grandparents give $300 to their single grandchildren and $500 to their married grandchildren, along with a note that says “to share with your spouse”. When opening up our gifts this year, I noticed my cousin, who had recently married his gay boyfriend, only received $300 while my fiancé and I received $500. I handed two hundreds from my envelope to my cousin in front of everyone, which caused quite the scene. My family is very religious and refuse to accept gay marriage as legitimate. They refuse to acknowledge his husband as a member of our family and tell him he is going to hell unless he changes his lifestyle. I defended my decision by saying, “we’re not married yet, and they are. I think there’s been a mistake”. Conversations quickly devolved, resulting in both my cousin and I leaving shortly after. My family insights it was not my money to give and my actions disrespected both my grandparents and my fiancé. My fiancé feels my family was welcoming her, and I rejected her in front of everyone. AITA?UPDATE: Cousin is taking us out to NYE dinner with their $200!"
169,Not the A-hole,"AITA for buying a $50,000 guitar for $4,000 and refusing to sell it back when the buyer found out the real value?",27594,ftum7d,5813,"This happened a while back. My wife and I still talk about it every once in a while. She's on my side and most of our friends and family are. However when it happened it was like WW3 between us and her co-workers and others.Here we go...I've been playing the guitar for 22 years. I know guitar values and whatnot very well. I'm very into the guitar market. At my wife's old company she was hanging out with co-workers one day after work and she mentioned that I play guitar. A co-worker who I guess is very popular at work said that his dad passed away and he was selling his dads things. His dad had a guitar and asked my wife if I'd be interested in it. My wife texted me and I said to have him send me the info on the guitar and the price. The next day he texted me the pics and price. It was a 1952 Telecaster in mint condition. He had the original receipts which was crazy! (That's how I knew the date). I asked what he wanted for it and he said he ""looked up Telecasters online and he thinks $4,000 is fair"". I texted back, ""I'll take it for $4,000"" and went to pick it up. The guitar had no sentimental value to him at all.Here's the issue at hand. The guitar was/is worth approximately $50,000 depending on the buyer and I knew it. When I got the guitar I told my wife the price and what it was worth. She was floored. Fast forward two weeks her co-worker tells my wife he just found out what the guitar was actually worth from a family friend and wanted it back. She said, ""well he really likes the guitar and he knew it was worth $50,000 which is why he was floored you offered it to him for $4,000. He really likes it and I doubt he will sell it back, but you can ask."" (Probably not the smartest thing for her to say, but she was caught off guard and it's not her fault or problem). He contacted me and asked to buy it back. I said that it's not for sale. He then said I scammed him and he was going to ""sue me and take my wife to HR for being a part of the scam."" Which was nuts, but he actually did contact HR. They were cool about it and said it's not their problem. It's between him and me. Over the next few months he made things very uncomfortable for my wife at work. He would bug her constantly about it. She eventually had to go to HR for harassment and they actually let him go (She complained twice and he was warned and didn't stop). He's contacted me several times about it so I got a restraining order for harassment too. I blocked him too. I haven't heard from him in about a year.AITA?UPDATE: Well this post blew up way beyond what I was expecting. It looks like I was voted Not The Asshole. There's over 5000 comments. I couldn't read them all, but I did read a lot. Just to clear up some things. I left somethings out because I didn't want it to influence opinions and really wanted it to be about me buying a guitar at significantly lower market value vs the people in the story. I did include the fact that the guy was harassing my wife at work not to make the guy sound bad, but because I thought it was relevant to the story. Here's some specific details I chose not to include:The guy and his dad were not close at all. So those people saying he was grieving and I took advantage of him, that is 100% not the case. When I went to get the guitar he was telling me he hadn't talked to his dad in six years and was actually annoyed he had to deal with a funeral.The dad bought the guitar new and never played it. Luckily it was stored in a closet and not in a basement or attic. There's no issue with the wood or electronics. It plays like a dream and I couldn't be happier. I am not selling the guitar to the son or anyone. It will be with me for a long time. I'm in my 30's so maybe in 30 years it will find a new home.I would have MAYBE considered giving the guy more money or giving him one of my guitars to sell on his own, but I decided not to do that after he left a terrible voicemail on my phone the day he found out the real value. He demanded it back like he was entitled to an object he sold fair and square, called me a POS, called my wife a POS and said he would ""do bad things"" if I didn't sell him the guitar back.And to those people who say they would have told the guy the real value. That's a load of horse shit. If you went to a garage sale/estate sale and saw an item worth $5000 priced at $50 there's not a snowballs chance in hell you would walk up to the homeowner and tell them they mis-priced it. You'd buy the item and then tell all your friends and family what a great score you got! Don't even kid yourself like you wouldn't do that. I don't feel bad about buying an awesome guitar at a steal of a price. I was curios what others would think and it looks like I'm not the asshole so thank you reddit. I can play the guitar with zero guilt now. Not like I felt guilty before, but now my feelings are justified."
170,Not the A-hole,AITA for going no-contact with my parents after learning they had lied to me about my allergies all my life?,27569,h808dd,2230,"Hey everyone. I am 19 years old and my parents are in their 50s.For as long as I can remember, I have been allergic to several things:* Dairy* Wheat/Flour/Gluten* LegumesSince I was a young child, my parents have completely kept all of them out of our house. While other kids ate breakfast cereals, I ate fish and assorted pickled vegetables for breakfast. While other kids had Lunchables, I had grilled chicken or fish with, again, assorted vegetables (usually sweet potatoes). While other kids ate birthday cake at the birthday party, I had an apple. I never questioned this until a couple of months ago. I was at my aunt's house for my birthday party, and she made brownies for everyone. For me, she took great steps to make them with almond flour and avoided all of my allergies. I started eating them and thought little of it until my aunt suddenly looked at me and, in a panicked way, asked which plate I took the brownies from. I pointed from the one where I got my brownies, and she immediately stood up and told me we had to get my EpiPen. She raced to ask my mother for it, and I sat there scared out of my mind because I had never mistakenly eaten flour before.I noticed my mother had calmed her down, and then she said that we don't have to worry because she had switched the plates of brownies, and after all I had eaten the ones made with almond flour. I found this incredibly odd because, really, why would she swap the plates? That doesn't even make sense. But for the time being I let the issue rest.It didn't sit well with me for about a week and I finally went to get an allergy test. The doctor started with a skin prick test, and lo and behold, I didn't react to any of the above substances. Then he ordered a blood test, and when the results came in, they said that I had absolutely no intolerance to any of the foods I'm supposed to be allergic to.I was furious and called my mother. She eventually admitted that she lied to me because she wanted me to be on a paleolithic diet, and wanted me to be able to avoid all temptations. She raised me with a lie about her own health, but she keeps insisting that I try to see it from her perspective. She spams my phone with messages about how healthy I am--that I never had acne, that I have been in great shape my whole life, that I have strong teeth and bones, and even that I got onto a D1 college tennis team. She has started calling me ungrateful for her intervention and insisting that I really should be glad I never got ""carb addicted."" I don't know what to think. I carried around an EpiPen for all those years--one that I suspect may be fake seeing as my mother never got me to replace it--and I don't even know anymore.Am I the asshole and an ungrateful son for losing it over this?"
171,Not the A-hole,AITA for changing my name? my parents named me Qur'stylle (Chrystal)?,27531,g1bn71,2589,"So my asshole scumbag parents named me Qur'stylle and my whole life i have gotten shit like ""are you muslim"" ""what language is your name originated from?"" ""what country are you from"" and people butchering its pronunciation, for obvious reasons. I have always told people to just spell it as Chrystal and my parents (mainly mom) would take huge offense to it and would email my teachers every year to make sure they pronounce my name correctly. My mom even grounded me once because I told people to just make save my name as Chrystal in their contacts. Now that I'm a legal adult i got my named changed to Chrystal so now i don't have to deal with this fuckign bullshit for the rest of my life. Having this bullshit spelling and having to correct everyone everyday was annoying as hell and everyone before they met me would always think I'm some spoiled brat bitch when that isn't true at all. Your name affects how people see you, much of it is subconscious, and having these bullshit spellings is not good. My mom lost her shit and started crying and threatened to cut me off for doing this. She said i betrayed her and our family by doing this. Im pretty sure I'm in the right but i need a sanity check here. I told my mom to go fuck herself and fuck her for causing me all these problems in my life and not supporting me and taking my complaints into considerations over my own fuckign name. My mom is a cunt and my dad is a spineless coward."
172,Not the A-hole,AITA? My husband won’t let me sleep.,27465,hjc6zy,1724,"Ok, so I work 12 to 16 hour shifts at an extremely labor intensive job that requires the use of heavy machinery. My job is dangerous and I need to stay focused while at work. This part is important. So, my husband has a friend who is a truck driver. His friend calls at odd hours every night. (Usually between 1am and 4am.) My husband always accepts these calls and then proceeds to have very loud, very long conversations right next to me which inevitably wakes me up and keeps me awake. I have asked him firmly, but politely, to either take the calls at a later hour, or to leave the room while he talks so that my sleep is not disturbed. He refuses to do this, and says that he has to answer the calls to help keep his friend awake while he is on the road. I understand wanting to help a friend, but I do not understand needing to keep me awake while doing it. So, for the last week, I have been locking myself in the guest bedroom and sleeping on the guest bed when I have a shift scheduled. Now my husband is angry and says that it hurts his feelings that I am no longer sleeping next to him every night. AITA?"
173,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my roommate that the name she chose for her baby is ‘ridiculously stupid’?,27466,j0z5qn,2615,"My roommate  (24f) is a big Game of Thrones fan. She’s pregnant with her first child right now. She decided to name her baby, ‘Arya’. When she asked my opinion of this name, I said I it was a good name with a good meaning (Arya means noble in Sanskrit), but a lot of people have named their kids Arya/Khaleesi/Sansa because of the popularity of GoT and it might be a little too common, not that it is a bad thing.The next day, which was yesterday, she said she’s found a way to name her baby ‘Arya’ and not have it be associated with other Aryas running around or the show. How? She said she wanted to spell it as *Aughreighyah*. I did a double take reading that word too, but apparently people are supposed to read it as Augh-reigh-ya or Arya. She asked me how I felt about it and I told her that, frankly, Aughreighyah looks ridiculously stupid and she should just go with Arya. She got kinda upset and said that she and her partner came up with this only because I told them that the name is very common. I said that having a common name is better than having a confusing name.

174,Not the A-hole,"AITA for refusing to share a room with a 1yr old, twin 2yr olds and a 4yr old?",27437,hjkqvx,2077,"So I F(18) was recently invited up to my aunt and uncle’s (I’ll call them aunt and uncle B) ranch house for the 4th of July, and told I could bring a friend. Now, this aunt and uncle have a pretty big house. Their ranch house has four bedrooms with queen beds, the master bedroom, and the “kids room” which is a massive room with about ~6 beds (some bunked), and a loft. They’ve got a lot of land around the house too, so I was excited to get some time to goof off and run around with my friend (also F18). I know that other cousins are going to be there, and assume that my aunt B and uncle B thought beds through and everything like that.The other people invited up to the house were Aunt G and Uncle G and their son M16 who I’ll call F, my Uncle P, and my Aunt and Uncle H.H’s are baby cannons. They have four kids under the age of 5, none of whom sleep through the night (I’ve been to their house before, it’s horrible). Anyway, my friend and I get up to the house and learn that WE are expected to share the big bunk room with the kids under five, while their parents get their own room. Uncle P, cousin F, and Aunt and Uncle G, are also in their own rooms (G’s shared one).I was upset. But, wanting to stay up there, I said okay, my friend and I can sleep on the couch.Cue a MASSIVE explosion.The baby cannons are pissed that I don’t want to sleep in the same room as their children. Their kids are horrible at night, and someone needs to watch them, so it should be me and my friend because I got to invite a friend. I said that if they wanted someone to, cousin F could, but cousin F apparently needed his sleep because he’s a “growing boy” and he “doesn’t know how to take care of kids”.None of the other people in the house wanted to get involved. The aunt and uncle who own the house didn’t care much and just told us to figure it out. So I ignore the baby cannons and set up on the couch with my friend.Cue the baby cannons mother. She throws all of our stuff off of the couches and tells me and my friend that we HAVE to sleep with her kids or we can’t stay. At this point, I’m mortified by her behavior because I have a friend. My friend is embarrassed and doesn’t know what to do.So I tell them I’m leaving.Cue more screaming.I drove up my father’s boat, if I leave, there’s nobody with a truck to drive the boat around, the world is ending.I say that either my friend and I are sleeping on the couch, without the small children, or we’re leaving.Well, baby cannons weren’t okay with that. So, I packed up my stuff, reattached the trailer for the boat, and left.Now I’m getting texts from relatives that I was rude and could have handled it better, and that the baby cannons need a break from their kids and I’m young so I can be a nice family member and deal with it for them. AITA here?UPDATE 7/1; My father has banned the baby cannon from ever going on the boat again. Aunt B is getting involved and is considering asking the baby cannon family to leave for the weekend and to not come back until they can be more considerate of relatives. Uncle B is offering to pay for me and my friend to go on a backpacking trip (my friend and I go a lot), and says that he feels bad for how the baby cannons acted."
175,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling my ex I got pregnant,27427,h83lq5,1898,"I (28 F) was with my ex-husband for about 6 years. During this time, we were trying for a baby but had no success. About 4 years into our marriage, our marriage had a rough patch. My ex had stress had work and slept with his coworker to ‘relieve’ it. He confessed to me rather quick and a week later, they sat me down and told me they were expecting a child. I was an idiot back then and so I felt like I should forgive him because I truly believed he loved me and I thought I had no one.  It wasn’t. My ex’s family treated me like their own, but my ex’s supposed daughter was the apple of their eye. As a result of that, my exs coworker was frequent presence in our lives. They felt like they had to include the mom of their grandchild for everything too and she made her way in every family picture and memory. It didn’t help that I suspected that the coworker had feelings for my ex and flirted with him when she can. People thought that she was my exs wife constantly and I finally had enough when during the baby girls first birthday party when I was told to take a picture of my ex, his mistress, his daughter, and his parents and it didn’t include me. It hit me that I was now treated as the other woman and I realized that I deserved more than this bullshit. I filed for divorce a few months later and left. It was the hardest time of my life but I ended up getting a promotion at work and met this sweet, wonderful guy. Fast forward to now, me and my boyfriend are madly in love and I gave birth to an adorable baby girl that I considered a miracle baby. I got pregnant with my boyfriend like 3 months after dating him and I thought that it was strange that this could happen since my previous failed attempts with ex and had thought that I was the infertile one. It crossed my mind then that maybe he was the infertile one and he only believed mistress was pregnant with his child because they were having an affair. I didn’t say anything though because it was not my place anymore. However, my boyfriend was so happy about my daughters birth and posted it on Facebook and tagged me in the post. I was still friends with my ex SIL on FB and she saw the post. She called me up and said that she was hurt that I didn’t let her know that I could actually get pregnant and the lack of child during my first marriage could be my ex’s fault. He took a paternity test. The poor baby girl was NEVER my ex’s. The coworker apparently was dating this ‘terrible’ guy during the time she slept with my ex and didn’t know who the child’s father was so she just strung my ex along cause she had feelings for him and thought he’d be the best father for her child. Now my ex blames me for not telling him that I was pregnant way before and him having to father this girl. He’s doing pretty bad now and I can’t help but feel guilty like I should’ve told him.EDIT: I didn’t realize that I could edit my post even after the 3000 character limit. Okay so first of all, I keep seeing that people have seen other posts like mine and some youtube video (??). If so, I’m upset that others have had similar situations as me and that some people find the situation so hilarious that they make a video out of it. I’ve also never posted on reddit before (I had a previous account for browsing not posting). I don’t think I have to prove my story and I honestly posted this not to seek validation that my ex supposedly is the worst ever, but to gain perspective since my ex and his family were MY family and close confidantes for a large period of my life. We were pretty close and I had promised to keep in touch after the divorce (which they were super upset about), but I really couldn’t after everything that happened between us. They’re now super pissed at me for the divorce and for being complicit in my ex taking on the expenses of his not-daughter and forming a paternal connection with her for longer than he should’ve. EDIT: So here’s what’s been happening right now, I haven’t spoken to them after this and have been avoiding my ex’s calls. He texted me saying that he is sorry and overreacted and felt guilty about prioritizing ‘people who were never really family’ over me. I only replied with asking how his daughter is because even though she isn’t biologically his, she’s still his girl. She seems like an adorable kiddo and adores her dad :(. My ex‘s mistress is able to support the girl financially so my ex won’t contribute to that but he says that he’s still going to see her every month because he feels morally obligated to. I feel bad for the girl so much because she seems to have lost her family unit (dad, grandparents, cousins)."
176,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my daughter that I absolutely do not support her ONLY wanting to be a Stay-At-Home-Mom?,27374,iunsyq,2541,"I don't have a problem with the idea of parents who stay home with their kids. It's not like that. I get that childcare is expensive, and that often times it just makes sense.What I have a problem with is my teenage daughter literally planning her life to *only* become a SAHM. As in, no college, no jobs, no certifications, nothing at all to support herself until that time might come.I told her that it doesn't have to be college, that not everyone needs college. But that she needs to do *something* to start making money to put away so that, if anything goes wrong with her plan, she has a way to support herself and the potential kids.Her feedback was that her backup plan was me and my husband -- she would move in with us and go from there. We would help them survive. I told her then, what happens if we die, or we're incapacitated? She said ""I don't know, Mom, this is ridiculous, none of it is going to happen.""I told her bluntly that I don't want her becoming Nancy Botwin 2.0, that if something happens, she *needs* to have a backup plan and something behind her other than relying on other people. I emphasized that again, it *does not need to be college*. She can start working retail to learn customer service skills that she can carry onto doing call center work from home if need be. She can start working as a receptionist somewhere, she can do any number of things. But she says no, she's going to plan to be a SAHM.With that all in mind, I asked her, when she graduates high school, what is she going to do? She said ""Just try to find a husband. Maybe marry someone in the military."" I asked her again, in between that time, how is she going to pay her bills? Her rent?She said she assumed she would be living at home.I told her no, and that she would be moving out. She could live at home if she gets a job or tries to get some kind of community college degree or certification. But that if she insists on being a deadbeat loser and waiting for a man to come and rescue her, she's on her own.This didn't go over well, and I am now being held up as totally unreasonable, mean, a huge bitch, etc.I don't think I'm wrong at all. I want to set her up for a lifetime of success and happiness. If this wonderful man who comes and whisks her away, knocks her up, etc, gets injured or dies, I don't want to have her come knocking at our door because she can't afford to take care of herself.AITA?**ETA:** Ohhhh my god, I posted this when I was SUPER agitated and walked away and forgot about it and came back to see all of the responses. Holy shit. Give me a few minutes to catch up. Damn."
177,Not the A-hole,AITA for accidentally calling out a new colleague on lying about her language skills?,27363,logumz,1928,"Last week a new colleague ""Cathy"" (33f) started at my (25f) work place. She instantly stood out in the team, because she seems like someone who is very... loud and assertive? Two of my colleagues, me and Cathy were having coffee in the break room (we were the only ones in there and we were sitting far apart), when the subject of travel was brought up. My colleague said she wasn't booking trips anymore because it'll probably get cancelled because of covid anyway. Cathy, immediately cut in about how sad she is because she travels so often and she goes on these far ""exotic"" trips to Europe as her hobby. When I think exotic I think the Bahamas or something instead of Europe but. Cool.Cathy then jokes about how all this ""no travel business"" is making her fear that she'll lose some of her foreign language skills. I asked what languages she spoke. She claimed to be fluent in 3 European languages, among which were French and Dutch. Cathy said she was ""at a native speaker level"" and went on about how people in Europe were always surprised when they found out she wasn't from there.I was excited, because I never get to speak Dutch over here. I was raised in Belgium, which has three national languages: French and Dutch (which are my mother tongues and the most commonly spoken there) and German. It's quite common to be pretty fluent in at least two out of the three languages in Belgium, because you're required to learn them at school (along with English) from a young age. I told Cathy ""oh leuk, dan hebben we iets gemeenschappelijk!"" (""oh fun, we have something in common then!"")She immediately pulled this sour face and asked me if that was supposed to be Dutch. I said yes. She laughed awkwardly and said she ""couldn't understand because I have a terrible accent and must not be that good at speaking it."" Now see, I don't have an accent. I speak Dutch more fluently than I speak English. I told Cathy that I grew up speaking Dutch and speak it to my family all the time.She got miffed and asked what languages I speak and where I'm from. I told her I'm from Belgium, so I also speak French and I added ""which you just said you speak as well, cool! We can speak French instead!"" I acknowledge that I was a bit of a dick here, because by that point I knew she probably lied about speaking French as well. She then shoved her chair back and angrily got up, said ""whatever"" and stomped off. It was awkward. My other colleagues just kinda shrugged and said she shouldn't have lied.However, she later approached me and told me I embarrassed her by acting ""superior"" about my European heritage. I told her there was no way for me to know she'd lied about speaking those languages. She rolled her eyes and told me I was immature. A colleague told me that Cathy had called me a ""little b-word who enjoys bullying new colleagues"" behind my back later. I don't think I was a bully at all, but I don't want this to turn into a huge thing. Do I just apologize to keep the peace? AITA?\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Edit1: I'm not sure about escalating this to HR, which a lot of people have told me I have to do. I feel like this might make me look immature to the rest of my colleagues (of which I am the youngest) and it might not need to go that far... It depends on if Cathy is willing to put this behind her and be professional. If all else fails I do have ""witnesses"" who would be honest about what happened, so I think I might be in the clear if she tries to twist the story. Edit2: Some people have taken offense to me giving the Bahamas as an example of an ""exotic"" place and are trying to make this into a race issue. I didn't know ""exotic"" was an offensive term in the US. Do I think of The Netherlands, Belgium, England, Norway, which were countries she was describing as being faraway exotic destinations, as my idea of an exotic trip? No. Not because there's a lot of white people there, but because when I think of exotic I think of a place with nice sunny weather, white sand beaches and a blue ocean. Maybe it's because I'm from Belgium, but I don't really feel like being in my home country where it's dark and rainy all the time is quite that experience. Edit3: Some people think she might not have understood me because she is fluent in Dutch, but learned it in the Netherlands, which has different accents. While it is true that The Netherlands and Flandres have different accents, I didn't speak a very specific dialect like West-Flemish or something. I spoke the general Dutch you'd see in the news in Flandres. I didn't speak quickly to try and make it incomprehensible to set her up. I genuinely believed she spoke Dutch because that's what she was saying, so I talked to her in normal, conversational Dutch. The same kind of Dutch I'd use in a work environment back in my home country, the same kind of Dutch I use with friends from The Netherlands. (But with a soft ""g"" lol.) "
178,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my cousin experience motherhood?,27329,idg5xh,3659,"I have a cousin by marriage (husband's cousin) that's 22 and dying of cancer. It was always her dream to marry and be a mom and now that's not going to happen. It's hard on everyone. She has a much older fiance (30) and they had a symbolic wedding so she could have the experience.They started looking for ways to get access to a baby that she could take care of and experience some level of child care that way, but with 2020 and ethics in general, there's not a lot of ways to do that safely. My husband and I have the first and so far only children of our generation, who are 10 months and 23 months old.I had hopes that it wouldn't happen, but her parents asked me if she/they could borrow my younger baby for ""a few weeks"". The cousin and her fiance would basically be playacting having a baby. Her parents would also join in on pretending. There would be photoshoots and everything. This makes me really uncomfortable.It's really creepy. I cannot understate how creepy I think this is. I know that her not getting to live her dreams is sad, but I don't think this is the answer.I'm worried it will be traumatic for my baby. She's almost a year old and will, well, notice that her entire family will just vanish overnight for what will seem like forever. She's also still nursing, and they don't really seem to care about this factor.I'm really worried about problems down the road. This is setting a dangerous precedent of my child living under other guardianship. Her parents will have time to get attached and they could try to use that for familial pressure if not legally. Her fiance is also a wild card in that regard.I said no, and my husband's entire family is hounding us about this because her time is running out and it's time sensitive. They say we're being selfish. They say that we could use this as a free vacation and bond with our older child because I ""popped them out so close together"". They want to compromise now by letting me come by a few times a day to bring milk. We still don't want to do this. AITAEDIT/UPDATE:Yesterday afternoon, we got an email from the cousin's parents offering actual dollar amounts for us to agree. We got enough from that to file a police report and at least get the threat in writing. We also had a call with my husband's parents and his siblings to basically clear the air. Apparently what they were telling people they asked for and what they were actually asking for were very different. Everyone on that call now had them blocked on social media except for MIL (because of the cousin)."
179,Not the A-hole,"AITA for dropping the ""We're Not Having Kids, Now Stop Bringing It Up"" bomb on my MIL?",27263,b5hirx,306," My husband and I don't want kids. My MIL is big into family in the traditional sense. She has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. Literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.My husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. Every time we see her, she asks. Everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said ""We might not even have kids"" and MIL would *not*hear it. At year 4, husband had a vasectomy and I had a tubal.So this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some BBQ and drinks and everything. When I get up to grab a beer, my MIL asks me if maybe I should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.I was annoyed by this and said ""There's really no chance.""MIL, all wide-grin, said, ""Oh come on! It's time for you two to finally get serious! Put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!""I said ""We've been official for about 5 years now, MIL,"" and drink the beer. Husband laughs with me.MIL gets more annoyed and says ""Well, you won't be REAL (Lastnames) until you bless us with babies!""Husband said, ""Mom, enough."" MIL pushed again. Husband repeated.After about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, I finally snapped and said ""MIL, Husband got snipped. I had my tubes tied. We're not having kids. You need to stop bringing it up. Period.""Well, I thought I started WWIII. She started crying and stormed off. Family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. We left. Party kinda ended. The social media bullshit started shortly after. Vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. Some meme about how ""I guess I wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother."" It's obnoxious to the point that I just muted all of them.My MIL finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if Husband and I came over and listened to her reasons that we really ""need"" to have kids. I told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said ""Well then, I guess you two aren't prepared to be REAL (Lastname)s. I'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding."" (It wasn't that much. It was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)I hung up on her. When recounting this to my friends, a few of them said that I was the asshole here for dropping it like that. But I don't think she was ever going to drop it if I didn't finally make a serious, direct comment about it. So AITA?"
180,Not the A-hole,AITA for watching GoT on an airplane?,27214,dxlxxk,4701,"Two days ago, I was on a long-haul flight. I was sitting in an aisle seat. Since I haven't seen Games of Thrones yet, I was looking forward to binge watch the first season. I made myself comfortable and set up my tablet. An hour or two into watching, the woman two rows behind me tipped on my shoulder and told me that I need to turn it off immediately. A little bit confused, I asked why. She told me that her young son could see the show playing on my tablet and it's totally not suited for such young children because of the sex and violence involved in it. While I agree with that, I told her that I'm not going to turn it off. She then basically told me that I am an asshole for not considering other people around me. Is she right?&#x200B;Edit: I want to clarify a few things that were mentioned in the comments:\- I was wearing headphones all the time.\- It was a flight with Swiss from Europe to a city in the United States. The in-flight entertainment system offered various movies and tv shows that were also not suited for children. However I have to admit that probably none was as bad as GoT. However, none of these shows was censored as far as I can tell.\- I'm not sure exactly where (aisle, middle or window) the kid was sitting since it was behind me and I think they switched seats frequently."
181,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my husband he “should have just married a white woman”,27179,iaubc9,3316,"For context I’m a black woman and my husband is white. I have 4c hair and I wrap my hair in a satin scarf to go to bed. For those of you who don’t know what that means, basically my hair curl pattern is really tightly coiled so my hair texture is kinky and easily tangled and easily breakable if not taken care of well. I used to sleep on a satin pillowcase when my hair was shorter and had a lower chance of tangling while I tossed and turned in my sleep. But recently I’ve added oils to my nightly routine and since my hair is a bit pass my shoulders now, the chances of it tangling are higher and I don’t want my pillowcases to get soaked with oils so I started wrapping my hair up again. First night I wore it my husband said that I looked like a slave which- ok was a little bit funny and a little bit true in my scarf and nightgown combo so I let him have that one. But since then, it’s the little comments when I get into bed. Like “are we doing the slave tonight?” Or “should I help you into bed grandma?” Little things like that. I’ve explained why l do it, and I think he understands that but he simply doesn’t like it and my hope was that he’d get used to it by now. Last night I was getting ready for bed and I couldn’t find my scarf anywhere so I asked DH if he’d seen it and he admitted that the hid it but wouldn’t tell me where. He wouldn’t stop joking around even when I got visibly upset and said he wished he could run his fingers through my hair or something along those lines and I snapped and said if he wanted that he should have married a white woman. He got really quiet after that and told me where he hid it. We haven’t talked much about it but there’s this air of awkwardness. The only times he mentioned it was this morning when he said that we should look into counseling for our “race issues” and that I made him feel really racist and I didn’t think about it that way. I thought he was upset because I yelled at him but I didn’t think it was the statement itself (granted I probably should not have brought race into it but I wanted to illustrate a point.) Now he’s suggesting couples counseling to get through our “race issues”? I don’t think it was that serious and I don’t want to go through all that. AITA?"
182,Not the A-hole,AITA For telling my wife her parents are not allowed to ever watch our son again,27180,iycyxr,3133,"My wife and I have a 2-year old son and have been married for 4 years.  Our anniversary was a month ago and we found a nice, secluded cabin on AirBnB and rented it out for a long weekend getaway.  My wife asked her parents if they would be willing to watch our son and they agreed as long as we dropped him off at their house.  That worked for us since it was on our way anyway.I was raised lutheran and my wife was raised catholic, but neither of us currently go to church and have not had our son baptized.  My MIL knows this and hates it. She thinks our son needs to be baptized or he will burn in hell, she's that kind of catholic.  So we go on our trip and when we pick up our son and ask how the weekend went, MIL says everything went fine and that she has saved my son's soul from the devil. I ask her what she meant and she says she had our son baptized that morning at her church. I tried my best to keep my cool so I didn't scream at MIL in front of my son, but I pretty much grabbed my son and left. On the car ride home I was fuming and told my wife as calmly as I could that this would be the last time her parents have our son unsupervised. She tried to downplay what her mom had done but I told her we need to wait until we get home to talk about it because I'm not fighting in front of my kid.When we got home and had a chance to talk about it, things got heated. I told my wife I no longer trust her parents with our son and that if they did something like this behind our backs I can't trust them to respect our wishes as parents in the future. I said this was a huge breach of trust and I will forever look t her mom differently. She continued to try to defend her mom saying that she was only doing what she thought was best for her grandson. She even downplayed it by saying that it's just a little water and a few words and we don't go to church anyway so what does it matter.I told her that under no circumstances will I allow her parents to watch our son by themselves again. I said that we can still let them see their grandson, but only if we are present. I also said that if she doesn't see what the big deal is with this situation, that maybe we aren't on the same page as parents and maybe we need to see a counselor. She started crying and said that this isn't the kind of decision I get to make on my own and I'm an asshole for trying to tell her what kind of relationship her parents can have with our son.I told her that I no longer have any trust or respect for her parents and that I don't know if there's anything they can do to repair that. I told her I don't care if that makes me an asshole, but what her parents did was unforgiveable in my eyes and they put themselves in this position to lose privileges with our son. She's been trying to convince me to change my mind for the last month, but I'm not budging. To me this is a hill I'm willing to die on."
183,Not the A-hole,AITA for being peeved about surprise tooth extractions during neutering,27139,ejkij2,3430,"Today I dropped my dog off to get neutered. He's a six-month Goldendoodle. This was part of a ""puppy package"" of care, which covered all necessary shots and wellness checks, and culminates with neutering and microchipping. I came back a few hours later to pick him up. While receiving the aftercare instructions, I was informed that they pulled a few of my dog's teeth by the vet tech (VT). Our conversation went something like this:VT: The only thing not covered by the puppy package is $20 for the two teeth we removed while he was under anesthesia, so if we can settle this up...Me: Excuse me, you removed teeth? He was here for neutering.VT: His two canines were starting to come in but the baby teeth were not loose so we removed them. It's very standard and what the vet regularly recommends.Me: Well, you did more than recommend it - you went ahead and did it.\*silence\*VT: I'll be right back....now it's important to note that I don't care about the $20 charge. Had I been contacted and told that they recommended this, I would have OF COURSE went with the vet's recommendation! But come on, at least act like I'm involved in the process rather than making me feel like I'm being suckered into a forced up-sell situation. A few minutes later, she came back...VT: I spoke with the doctor and we are going to discount the $20 since we did not consult you first.Me: It's not about the $20. I'm more concerned about the fact that I came here for one procedure, and without any conversation or discussion, you expanded the scope of the visit to include tooth extraction.VT: It was necessary. If we were to have done it at a separate visit, it would have been $250.Me: I'm not concerned about the money if it's necessary. I'm concerned about not knowing about it or approving it beforehand.VT: It's a very routine procedure. We regularly extract teeth while puppies are already under anesthesia.Me: If it's so routine and done so regularly, why was it not discussed at one of the many prior visits or even this morning?VT: You know if we didn't extract the teeth, it could have lead to issues with alignment, bacteria, and other complications.Me: I'm not debating whether the extraction was necessary. I'm upset that I was not consulted first.VT: I'll be right back....this time she brought my puppy back with her. I thanked her and left. To be clear, I was not trying to be rude, difficult, or cheap in any way. But I got into the car with my poor sedated pup feeling like I was being rude, difficult, and cheap. I spoke with a few coworkers after I got back to my office, but I could use some other opinions as well. So, AITA for being peeved about surprise tooth extractions during neutering?&#x200B;\*edit: this has, obviously, gotten way bigger than I had ever thought it would. To anybody that posted on here to vent their spleen and then hit the front page, you know what I mean... that being said, I wanted to offer a few points of clarification because I've seen quite a theme in the comments:1. Most important of all: my puppy is snoozing next to me and seems to be in overall good shape - for that, I'm grateful to the vet.2. It amazes me how many of you post things like ""you're obviously NTA, why would you even post this""... scroll the comments and look at some people on the other side. The reason I posted this is that I was conflicted and was wondering what people thought - and wow, you folks did not let me down.3. I don't plan on talking about who the vet/clinic/hospital is or where it is located. I was not pleased by their customer service, but I am not trying to hurt their business in any way (I will not even post a negative review even though I will be changing providers).4. I'm not upset about the fact that they made a decision that they thought was necessary. I'm upset that they could not explain that decision, or perhaps felt it was unnecessary to explain to me. Please keep in mind that I'm not a vet. I went to school for history and business. If someone had explained things to me, I might have quickly calmed down and the situation deescalated. This would have been best handled, in my opinion, had the vet came to speak to me.5. For the men that are messaging me thinking I am a woman: I'm not.To maybe lighten the mood a little bit, how about a laugh at how silly a Goldendoodle's shaved arm looks? []("
184,Not the A-hole,AITA for flipping out on my sons school after they lied to him about donation prizes?,27057,j6qi9b,2056,"I will try not keep this short with just points rather than description. If INFO is needed, please ask.Son is in 4th grade. School is only open on Mondays. The rest of the week he is home with me. They dont do virtual learning during the rest of the week. No zoom calls are made. No teacher actually checks in. Homework at home is not to be sent back to the school and instead they get a participation grade the following week if they tell their teacher they completed it. Its backwards and your students arent being graded for the work they actually do.Every monday we get a new flier in the mail asking for donations. Last week we got a flier that said to send out 20 emails to individuals to ask them for donations, with the promise of prizes for participation. They also had other prizes on this flier. Basically, the more people who donate using your name, the bigger the prize you get. My son wanted the headphones prize. No where on the flier did it say how many donations was needed. I called the school to ask and they said 12. I sent out the 20 emails. 14 people donated. The donation list was to be emailed to the school with the student ID and we were to pick up the prizes this past Monday. Son was losing his mind excited because he got the 12 donations needed for the headphones. We walk in and they proceed to tell me and my son that he did not qualify for the prize because in order to be eligible, you needed to get those 20 donations. Apparently the prizes for donations started counting AFTER you recieved the 20. They turned damn near every student away, not just my kid.So I sent the boy out with his father and pulled the teacher and principle aside to let them know that I thought it was fucked up that they got these kids hopes up for absolutely nothing and that all they accomplished was destroying the children's spirits by lying to their faces. I then told them that I was told by the secretary that he only needed 12 donations for those headphones. They said ""Sorry you feel that way. This is just how things are right now due to Covid."" So I responded with ""Oh. So lying to students and breaking their spirits is okay because of Covid? Failing to provide virtual learning for the rest of the week like other schools is okay because of Covid? Asking for donations when the kids are only here once a week must be okay too right?"" I then walked out. Well, my son got the headphones in the mail today with a note from the superintendent that said ""I'm very sorry for the actions of the school system and the confusion formed around the donation drive. We are trying to work with the families, not turn them away. Please accept this as an apology."" My son is over the moon. My husband says that I was being a Karen and that we should have just dropped it because it teaches our son that life isnt fair and that I now look like an AH helicopter parent.AITA? I dont think I am."
185,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving the family restaurant and starting my own after finding out I wouldn't inherit it?,27050,gul6fn,2752,"My dad owns a pizza place that was handed down to him from my grandfather.I've been working at the pizza place my while life, even part time while I got a business degree.I found out last early last year that my dad had willed the restaurant to my stepmom. His reasoning being she needs to be taken care of after he dies. And that it would go to me after she died.I was pissed and ""quit"" the next day. My dad ended up hiring two people to make up the work I was doing.Now this is the potential asshole part. A month after I quit, I found a great location where another pizza place had shut down. I bought it and had it up and running in two months. My restaurant is take out only, but my business is doing extremely well. My dad reached out to me last September and said that his restaurant was losing business because of me and to please come back to the family business. He offered to buy my business so I would get something out of it.I declined the offer. Now the craziness of 2020 happened and because my restaurant was already setup for takeout, I'm only seeing a 5-10% drop in revenue.The family restaurant however, is going under.  Now there's a whole lot of arguing about me causing my dad's family to become financially ruined.AITA?"
186,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to return a tip AND telling a couple that I dont have time to play mediator?,27046,j1d4gn,1659,"I'm a 22 year old, female waitress at Texas Roadhouse. This is one of my two jobs to put myself through college. Most days are fine but other days are a living hell.Yesterday I was assigned a table that had a husband, wife and what appeared to be a teenage daughter (maybe 17). Everything was going smooth at first and the wife ordered a margarita. The husband then tried ordering a beer. The wife instantly lost her noodles and said ""Uh, no. He will not have a beer. He will have a water."" She then turned to him and said something along the lines of him not needing to drink because he was driving. He said no, the daughter could drive. It was childish.Anyways, he keeps telling me he wants a beer. She keeps telling me no. In this industry, situations like this are a lose/lose for waitresses. If I get him the beer, wife wont tip. If I dont get him the beer, he wont tip. Damned if I do, damned if I dont. So while they were arguing AT me, I said ""Listen, I really dont have time to play mediator here."" They went silent. I went and got both of them their alcohol. Daughter gives me an apologetic look upon my return, presumably because her mother was acting bat shit crazy upon seeing me bring a beer in tow.Flash forward to after their meals. Husband has had 2 beers at this point. Wife has stopped drinking and glares at me everytime I return. Wife and daughter go to the car while husband pays. Husband drops me a $40 tip on a $68 tab. I told him I couldnt accept it. He insisted. Eventually I pocketed it. Wife comes in an hour or so later demanding that I give her the $40 her husband gave me, stating that I was a terrible host and went against her and I dknt deserve a tip. She got my manager involved who said ""She is not obligated to give you her tip. You left the restaurant and the tip has already been processed. Have a nice night."" She was fuming, screaming at me about how much of an AH I was for supplying her husband alcohol after she said no. Other guests started chiming in saying that she was being ignorant and that I was doing my job, which is to provide guests with what they want and said that it wasnt MY fault that she was a controlling wife. She storms out.Given the fact that I was put on the spot like that, I feel insanely guilty. AITA?"
187,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking out a girl from my daughter's sleepover bday party?,27030,f9m670,2765,"My (34M) daughter (14F) had a sleepover b-day party last saturday, and she invited 5 girls from her school.There was this one girl that she invited who I could tell from her attitude, was a spoiled brat. When she rang the doorbell, she walked in looking down at her phone, didn't greet me or my wife, and handed me her jacket without even looking up.The whole night she was on her phone doing whatever the heck 14 year olds do on phones. I thought she was just embarrassed or shy because maybe she didn't know anyone, but according to my daughter, she is a ""super duper cool girl"".Anyways, towards the end of the night, my daughter was opening her gifts. SB made a comment about every single gift. (not exactly snarky, but more like she was just unimpressed)The final gift was from me and my wife, we bought her an iPhone 7 by pooling all of our remaining extra money to buy her it.the SB scoffed because she had the newest gen iPhone. I helped my daughter set up the phone with a sim card, and the rest of the night they just hung out in her room.My daughter came down a bit later and she was just sitting on the couch, I asked her what was wrong and she just went back up while saying ""why couldn't you have just bought me the newest iphone??"". That was really out of character for her, as she is always grateful for receiving anything.My daughter left the phone on the table. I grabbed my daughter's phone to see a bunch of texts going back and forth between SB and my daughter, they exchanged numbers and the convo went something like this:D ""hey its me""SB ""thanks for inviting me to ur lame slumber party lol, and congrats on the iphone SEVEN haha""D ""what""SB: ""arent u mad that ur parents and friends got u such lame gifts""SB ""slumber parties are for little girls lol, but wtvs its cool""D ""u dont like the party..?""SB ""I jus wish i could go home looool""\~endIt was around 1AM and the girls were still up talking, I knocked and asked if I could speak with SB, she looked confused, I told her she needs to grab her things something came up. (I did this as to not embarrass my daughter in front of her friends).I took her downstairs and asked her to call her mom, she asked why and I said ""because thats what you said right? that you wish you could go home? so go."" She was tearing up a bit, and made the call.I talked w/ her mom for a bit when she came, I showed her the texts and she apologized profusely and said ""its just a teenager phase I guess. I'm so sorry, but dont you think she could stay? If not I understand.""I thought ab it for a bit, but her staying probably would have made it awkward for everyone, so I told her it was best if they just left.My wife said that I overreacted, and I should have just talked with SB rather than immediately kick her out, I firmly believe I taught her a good lesson that she needed to learn. It was MY DAUGHTER's bday, and I didn't want the rest of her night ruined because of some spoiled brat who was making it all about her. I guess she didn't exactly do anything wrong, but at the same time her attitude was unbelievable. AITA?"
188,Not the A-hole,AITA for cutting off my mother when she got a paternity test for my daughter?,26976,hd7upi,3433,"I've been with my wife for 8 years. We have 2 children, a 5 year old daughter and a 2 year old son. I've known since my wife got pregnant that there was a possibility our daughter wasn't my biological child. I don't care. She's my daughter and my wife has never been unfaithful. However, I don't want to know if she is or she isn't biologically related to me, and I've never wanted to know.Edit to include the full story as people are assuming she cheated:  My wife and I were together for around 2 years when we had a fight and broke up. We were broken up for 3 months, during which we both slept with other people, and then we got back together. After approx 2 months of being back together, my wife found out she was pregnant. We knew there was a possibility of one other man being the biological father, and it was a toss up between me and him, but it was more likely to be mine. My wife was honest with me that she'd slept with other people when we got back together, and I was equally honest, and the window of conception for our daughter was just large enough we couldn't say for sure if she was conceived when we were together or apart and while she offered to get our daughter tested, I didn't want to know. My entire family were aware we broke up and got back together.Visibly, she looks like her mother. Same dark hair, same dimples, same bone structure, and I see bits of myself in her, too, mainly in her mannerisms, with the only part that doesn't match up being her eyes, which are brown, while mine are green and my wife's are blue. Meanwhile my son, with his green eyes, blonde hair, and bone structure, looks like I cloned myself, and looks very different to his dark haired, dark eyed sister.My mother has noticed, and remarks on it often. This really gets my wife's hackles up, both because of the reality behind that, which my mother is unaware of, and because she and my mother have clashed a few times in the past. They are very different people, and their personalities just don't mix.Then a few months ago my wife's sister and my best friend (they're married) got into a car accident, they were in the hospital with one of their 3 kids, while the other 2 were home alone, so we asked my mother to watch our kids while we helped them out. Our kids were with her and my dad for about 5 hours.Last week mum came over and said she had something important to tell me. When she had my daughter unsupervised, she did one of those DNA test kits on my daughter, comparing it to her own DNA (which she apparently ordered months ago for this exact purpose and was waiting to use it) and it confirmed my daughter isn't biologically related to me, and she began to tell me about a lawyer she could get me in touch with to begin divorce proceedings. I told her this changes nothing, she's still my daughter and that's my wife she's talking about. Mum was shocked, and called my wife some names I don't care to repeat. I told her to get out of my house.It's been nearly a week. I've told my wife, blocked my mother on everything, and there's been constant calls and texts. My mother is furious I never told her that I had an inkling, and has since disowned my daughter, but says my son is still her ""special little guy"" so she wants a relationship with my son but not my daughter. In addition to my mother, all 5 of my siblings (3 sisters, 2 brothers), and dad are angry with me, they want me to get back in touch, and a couple of them have even said I should thank mum for what she did as she was looking out for me and now I know. However, I can't justify my mother going behind my back to get a DNA test on my daughter without consulting me.I feel I'm in the right, but I also feel I could be overreacting, and I would appreciate another perspective as I'm seriously considering cutting contact with my mother over this.AITA?&#x200B;EDIT: I DO NOT GIVE CONSENT FOR THIS TO BE TURNED INTO A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE"
189,Not the A-hole,"AITA for refusing to babysit my nephew, even in a family medical emergency, because my brother and SIL lied before?",26934,ip8hw1,1804,"I am my brother and SIL’s only relative in the city. When SIL was pregnant I made it clear that I’d only babysit for them in the case of a serious emergency, e.g. someone has a medical emergency. I won’t babysit if they just wanted time off from being parents, because I don’t have the free time for that. I work 60-100 hours a week, so if anyone needs time off, it’s me. Last year, my brother and SIL asked me to babysit on the day of an informal work meeting, a lake retreat organized by my company. Everyone is expected to go, and it’s frowned upon if you miss it. They wanted to go on a date. I said no, I have an important work event. They continued to nag me about how they haven’t gone on a date for so long. The night before that day, they called in a panic and said their friend Mike from the next city over had been in a car accident, and I needed to babysit nephew for a few hours so that they could go visit Mike. I reluctantly agreed, with the stipulation that they’d be back by 7 am the next day to pick nephew up so I could leave for my work event. They did not come back until two days later. I had to cancel on my superiors morning of, which looked awful. My brother and SIL never responded to multiple texts and calls from me. Their excuse was that Mike’s life was in danger and they were too busy helping his girlfriend. I accepted that, since I had met both Mike and his girlfriend at a party in the past and thought they were good people, but I emphasized that this absolutely could not happen again. Throughout the next two months, my brother and SIL regularly used the excuse of aiding Mike in his recovery and needing to visit him in order to make me babysit my nephew.Mike’s girlfriend’s company and my company had a meeting two months after Mike’s “accident”. I ran into her and asked her how Mike was recovering. Apparently, she had no idea he had ever been hospitalized. Neither did Mike. Mike had never been in an accident, and although brother and SIL had gone to visit them recently, it was for drinks and bowling, not bringing them chicken noodle soup in the hospital. I confronted brother and SIL, and they denied at first, but finally admitted they had been lying about Mike’s accident so that they could go on date nights. They claimed I “gave them no choice since I would never help them out when they needed time together because parenting was so stressful and difficult and I had no idea and it was just a little white lie”. I made it clear that after this incident, I would never babysit for them again, and I’ve stuck to that. Yesterday my brother and SIL begged me to babysit for them because there was an actual medical emergency in SIL’s family. They even sent me proof of the relative’s hospitalization. I still said no. They didn’t care about betraying my trust, so I don’t care if they can’t afford childcare or if their relative is in the hospital. They said I was a bad aunt, needed to get over my grudge, and a petty asshole. AITA?"
190,Not the A-hole,AITA for going to my sister’s dream school when she just got rejected?,26884,b84xxt,2491,"[UPDATE](, I got into Cornell last week. Honestly I think it was fluke. I’m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...My twin sister is the opposite of me. She’s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn’t and still don’t mind, it’s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn’t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don’t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). Well last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn’t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. Well anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn’t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I’m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don’t know how but I did. I really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she’s been crying and solemn and sad. She’s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She’s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn’t been herself. I haven’t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn’t get in because she didn’t). Am I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it’s Cornell. I couldn’t in a million years imagine I’d get in. I’ve been researching obsessively about it and I can’t shake the desire that if I don’t go, I’ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it’s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. Am I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don’t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she’s worked compared to me...TLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn’t. She’s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?UPDATE: so everyone here told me that I should go, so I decided to tell my sister. Well, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn’t I tell her earlier and she’s so proud of meBut seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. She went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. Like uncontrollably bawling. I tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...I going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.Update 2: Please let me know if my updates are annoying; I only expected 3-4 comments and didn’t know so many people were interested, so I thought least I could do is update So after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. It said:> I’m sorry for how I reacted; please don’t be mad. I’m so happy for you and your accomplishments. It’s just that after I got rejected, I at least had the consolation that I get to go to school with you and we can go together. But now you’re going to be where I wanted to be and I’m just so sad. I worked so hard and did everything I could to go to the best school I can and I just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. I’m sorry I’m ranting I just need more timeI’m not going to lie guys, when I read this, I cried. A lot of you are saying that I obviously I have to have attributes that made me desiresble but I really don’t. I don’t deserve my acceptance. I did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest AP classes available, etc. Meanwhile I see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. She deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. I’m really strongly just considering going to NYU with her. Everyone at Cornell will just be just like her and I don’t stand a chance. And I know if I go to Cornell, we’re going to drift apart which would suck because we’re best friends and I just don’t want to lose my sister :(Update 3: So I told my parents and they did NOT react how I would've expected them to. First, they tried to insist that Cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be IMPOSSIBLE; if we applied to the same school within Cornell, like we both applied to Arts and Sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. They couldn't have mixed them up). Then they went on to explain how I should go to NYU with my sister. I thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to Cornell if I didn't get in. My sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would I not go to Cornell, and they said how it was unfair that I basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. I don't know if I'm being dramatic, but that hurt. I knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that I don't deserve my spot sucks. Even though they're probably right.I stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. She asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that I 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. My parents were SHOCKED because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. This started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. I'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. I realize that I have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. I'm glad I have my sister actually believe in me.I still don't know if I want to go to NYU or Cornell, mostly because I just don't want to go to school without her. She's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. At the end of the day, I ALWAYS thought the NYU was going to be the school I was going to, so I wouldn't lose much by choosing it over Cornell. I'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. Thanks again everybody for your comments; I wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that I got in.Update 3.5: No new news but I just wanted to say that I'm reading every single comment and I apologize if I don't get to you individually and I appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! You guys are amazing :)"
191,Not the A-hole,AITA for using my moms religion against her after insulting my sons hair?,26811,ie1fvh,1591,"I (32F) was raised Mormon but I’m not now, nor do I follow any other religion. My mom is still very much in the cult. As such, she has the typical Mormon mindset regarding gender roles and all that bullshit. Granted, I still think she’d be this way without her religion, though maybe not as bad. We get along splendidly, except when the topic of her religion comes up, which doesn’t often.She’s visiting right now. I don’t see her in person much but she came down for my birthday. It’s also important to note that I have two sons. My 5 year old has a Mohawk. My 3 year old has shaggy, shoulder length hair. He’s never had a haircut for a multitude of reasons, none of which would even be asked if he were a girl. Not long after she got here, she started going in on his hair. This is not the first time she’s given her opinion on it. Why don’t I cut it? Don’t I want to prevent him from being bullied? Or from people thinking he’s a... GIRL??? Because he hasn’t asked and I want it to be his choice. Because he acts like I’m murdering him when I brush his teeth and hair. Because he also flails around like he’s having an exorcism so imagine that with a pair of scissors. Because if someone sees long hair and assumes “girl,” that’s on them and a simple “he’s a boy” corrects it. But mostly it’s because I don’t fucking want to. She got pissed and said what she really thought, which was: “Well I just don’t like long hair on boys.” Clearly. Yet she has no problem with my other sons MOHAWK. Guess that’s boyish enough for her. AND she said it in front of both my sons, which pissed ME off. I said the first thing which came to my head, which was: “If you have a problem with long hair on boys, I suggest you take it up with your lord and savior Jesus Christ. You can start by asking him to get a haircut. Call John the Barber.”Bruh. If looks could kill, I’d be in outer darkness right now. She steeped in her anger for a while but didn’t say anything else. She hasn’t changed her opinion nor will she, but I don’t think she wants to get roasted again either so she won’t bring it up anymore. I feel like we’re both assholes. As much as I hate her religion, that was also a low blow and I have a tendency to speak first, regret later. Though I don’t necessarily regret my words, I do regret how they made her feel. She is my mom after all.Update: Oh my Heavenly Father, I didn’t expect this at all. Thanks for the rewards and honest responses. I’m glad I could make so many of you laugh. I’m here all night. Seriously though, working until 7 am and gonna waste it all reading comments. See you all in the telestial kingdom."
192,Not the A-hole,AITA For Refusing to meet my sister on Christmas after she called CPS?,26804,kebg11,2497," ●I M37 lost my wife of 10 years and it was so devastating for me and my daughter. It's unfortunate but life goes on no matter what happensMy family knows how much I struggle as a single dad and my sister doesn't really get it. She had issues with my late wife in the past but now started ""helping"" with my daughter. She re-decorated my daughter's room without my consent, she'd insist I let my daughter go spend days at her house but my daughter is comfortable at her home. She then started calling my daughter with another name and I'm still trying to understand her logic behind this. I told her to stop doing those things and to be respectful and supportive and she defended herself saying I'm lashing out of grief.I recently. started teaching my daughter to do stuff on her own like brush her hair/clean her room/wash her cups/make sandwiches while I take care of bigger stuff. My sister said that what I'm doing is wrong. That I'm giving her more than she can handle. She's just a kid and although I told her I'm teaching my daughter to be more independent she said that I'm clearly doing this for my own benefits and avoiding responsibility.I got into a fight with her about it. Told her she has zero say in this. And the next day. A CPS Officer came to my house and took a tour around the houseMy first thought was ""maybe he got the wrong house"" until he started reading the report to me saying that I'm never home and that I make my daughter do things that aren't her responsibility, neglecting her education  (btw she's homeschooled) and that I'm not taking care of basic hygiene and whatnot. I told the officer my story and explained that I'm adapting as a single parent and he proceeded to aske my daughter some questions.It was clearly a false report. However I was told that I will have a permanent record with CPS. and I was shaken up by this. I told my family about it and my younger sister told me that my sister was the one who called CPS after we had a big argument. I was so mad I confronted her after she hid herself. Called her immature and stupid to pull this crap (she's in her 40s) and that she's no longer my sister. Then cut contact. It's been months and now my dad started bringing her up knowing how uncomfortable I was. He said that my sister feels sorry for what she did and wanted to talk things out on Christmas dinner.But I said no. He and the others insisted saying that I should be the bigger person. the family will be incomplete without me and my daughter on Christmas. Saying I refuse to be a ""civil adult"" to solve the issue that is dividing the family. I yelled and said that my daughter and I don't have to go after what she did, doesn't matter if she has issues on her own and didn't ""mean it"" and was just concerned. wtf was she so concerned about? They demanded that I at least let my daughter go be with them >>and her auntie << on Christmas.Edit: I don't want my daughter to go and I plan on going to my in-laws instead. I want to talk to her about it and see what she wants to do."
193,Not the A-hole,AITA For walling off my backyard because I dislike 2 kids and depriving everyone else as a result?,26798,hstpcc,1650,"I sure feel like TA but I don't think I am so help me out here.I live in a non English speaking European country and because of history that means land borders between properties are sometimes very weird. Well that is the case with my house and the neighbors, all our houses are about the same size yet out of all the land behind our houses my area is huge I own like 90% of all land there reaching all the way to the woods far behind our houses, meanwhile all my neighbors essentially got tiny strip right behind their houses.Now the part right behind my house is fenced off yet the rest is pretty much open and my wife and daughters like to use it for gardening. The field is used by most of the neighborhood boys to play football on as it is the only flat piece of grassland around they always ask for permission to use it before hand and I always allow it on the condition I get no complaints if I tell them to leave and they don't litter. I also recently had a pool installed to the far back of my property and fenced it off, this is important later.Well this is where the issue starts, recently a new family moved in and they seem to think it is public land. I kept catching their kids running around through the flowers and vegetable garden and they even moved their grill on the field and held a picnic on my land. I keep telling them off and informing it is my land, but they just ignore me and the kids sometimes wont leave when I tell them to. A month ago the kids even climbed over the fence around the pool  and when I got them out and went to their parents they just said ""Oh we figured it was a public pool"", I had hoped that was the end of it yet these people build a fire pit in the 3 days I was away from my house and when I got back I found it with a bunch of empty beer cans around.That was the last straw for me and I hired a company owned by a buddy of mine from when I used to do construction work, bought all the supplies, and 7 days later and a lot of money lighter my entire property was walled off and whenever anyone asked I told them why I was doing that and who they could thank for it.Well now the new family is treated as if they are a pest and all the neighborhood kids are gutted they lost their football field which has resulted in them picking on the new neighbors kidsI honestly feel pretty terrible, but I also feel like I gave them plenty of warnings before taking drastic actions."
194,Not the A-hole,AITA for suing my biological father for unpaid child support?,26759,hyowye,1740,"I don't have a relationship with my biological father. He left her when she got pregnant and never acknowledged that he had a child, always saying she was lying. She did prove paternity in court and got an order for child support. At the time at least, he had a job making well over 6 figures that was handed to him by his parents as well as rental properties, so the ordered amount was pretty high. He refused to pay it at all and somehow got away with it. My mother has died and I'm her only child. He's never had a relationship with me, and in this matter, I wanted justice for my mother. While I couldn't independently sue for that back child support, I could essentially sue on behalf of her estate. I won, and he owed me almost $350,000, plus my legal fees. He cried poor, but the judgment was paid almost immediately, so either he was not, or his parents bailed him out.I've seen his wife's social media, and she's posting about ""bastards wanting a payday"" and other tears. Some of my friends and family think that I shouldn't have just used the legal system to get money that wasn't technically mine. AITA?"
195,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my boyfriend name our daughter Renesmae?,26750,lmp6fs,4521,"My boyfriend and I are both 18, and 35w pregnant with our daughter. Since the day I found out we were having a girl he was hell bent on naming her Renesmae, absolutely refuses to compromise. He's a massive twilight fan, I personally hate it and would much rather that we don't name our baby after a fictional character. It kinda hit boiling point last night, for weeks I've been telling him we are coming up with something else becaudr I'm not naming my child that. I went onto Instagram where he had posted a picture of us and said in the caption ""I can't wait to meet you Renesmae.""I got really really mad my this. I told him to delete that, or change the caption because I'm not naming our daughter that. He refused, saying his friends knew now so we had to stick with it. I said ""I haven't fucking agreed to naming our daughter after some stupid made up character from the worst books ever fucking made. Delete the post now or get the fuck out of my house"". He left to spend the night at a friends and my parents who heard the argument said I should just let him name our daughter that, saying it probably means a lot to him and that I'm being an unreasonable asshole. AITA?Edit: Feel the need to add, I have a stutter and can't even say Renesmae out loud, I would much rather name my child something I can say.Stop trying to adopt my child. She is very much loved and wanted."
196,Not the A-hole,AITA for moving out mid-lease and stranding my roommate with full rent after his girlfriend keeps accusing me of being “creepy”?,26740,ifk8n6,2315,"So I’ve been living with my current roommate for 2 years now. I’m actually subletting and I’m on my 2nd year which is month-to-month, but we’ve had an unofficial “verbal” agreement that I’d stay until the end of the year. I mean it’s a pandemic, I didn’t think I’d move either. Anyways his gf moved in beginning of this year. It’s been...a lot. She’s obviously had some trauma in the past. I didn’t dig but I believe she was the victim of a home robbery a few years back.Well when she first moved in my roommate had some “ground rules” for me so his gf would be more comfortable. She obviously wasn’t thrilled about having another roommate.He said I couldn’t talk to her (like strike up a convo) if he wasn’t there because she doesn’t want to have to talk to me if she didn’t have to. He also said it would be best if we tried to not use the same facilities at the same time (like if she’s cooking in the kitchen, I should wait until she leaves before I grab food, etc.) Like yes it’s strange but I figured it’s his place so whatever. I’m not trying to befriend her either.Things got worse in recent months cause we’ve all been working from home. It’s REALLY hard to avoid someone 24/7. So obviously I’ve slipped up more. One time I came home from Costco and offered her a spare bottle of coconut water I couldn’t fit in the fridge. Big mistake. My roommate had to have a “talk” with me that night about how I should know she would never drink my drinks and it’s weird for me to even offer. The most recent one was when she was watching some GoT in our living room. I just absentmindedly watched a bit standing behind the couch. I laughed at a scene which startled her when she looked up and saw me standing behind her. I got another earful from my roommate about how I needed to stop “creeping” on her now that I’m home all the time. Long story short, my friend just had a place open up that’s cheap and I’m gonna move. I told my roommate and he’s pissed, because of our unofficial agreement and how he’s probably gonna pay full rent for a while. I feel bad because yeah, I did say I wasn’t gonna move. But I’m also pretty sick of both him and his gf. However, I feel kind of guilty because I agreed to their weird rules before all this started back when I thought it’d be ok."
197,Not the A-hole,AITA ruining my friend's birthday party by taking back the cake I baked for her?,26735,jnxiz8,1223,"My friend is quirky. She was never diagnosed with anything but she is very clueless sometimes. I have had to spell things out for her a lot. Few months back, she borrowed a dress of mine. I really love that dress. There isn't any sentimental value but I got it when we were on vacation few years ago. She also loved the dress and one day just transferred the money to my account and told me that she was keeping the dress.I spoke to her but she just told me that doesn't matter as she has paid me. Her birthday was a week ago and her mom asked me to bake a big cake for her. I usually sell cakes cheap (little more than ingredients cost). On her birthday, I went over to her house with the cake 15 mins before the party was due to start and then decided to talk to her mother. Like I said, sometimes my friend is really clueless sometimes and I was hoping her mom would speak to her and get my dress back. I was very shocked when she also said that as long as I was paid what does it matter. She told me to just move on as it was just a dress and that my friend really liked it. She told me as long the dress was paid for, what am I complaining about. I got really pissed off and pulled out the amount she paid me just paid me, put it on the table, picked up the cake and left. She got mad and started yelling at me that I was ruining the party. I kept walking back to my house. She kept telling me to give back the cake and that I couldn't take it back just because I want to be petty. I just asked what she was complaining about as I had paid back the money. My friend ended up having a cakeless 16th birthday because of this. AITA here?"
198,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling everyone exactly why I'm getting divorced?,26682,i4vv3t,1446,"My ex and I have one child together. We found out during my pregnancy that our child would be deaf, and wouldn't qualify for the surgery that some deaf people are able to get due to a combination of problems. While the external issue is a fluke, the internal issue is apparently something that I always had a 25% chance of passing down to a child. Not to toot my own horn, but once I learned this, I made an effort to start connecting with the Deaf community in my area and learn ASL. He did not, and while he stayed for the birth, he moved in with his brother right after dropping me off at my home. I own the house, and did before I met him, so it's not part of the divorce. He was nice enough to give me 2 months worth of a cleaning service and a gift card to GrubHub. He ended up telling everyone that I am the reason he doesn't see our child, and that I filed for divorce because I overreacted.  The truth is that I have sole custody because he cried, in court, that he couldn't ""deal"" with the baby and wanted to just pay support. While I did file, it was because he abandoned me and said so many horrible things that I couldn't get over. I have text messages he sent me which say that he wouldn't have married me if he knew that we would produce ""problems"" and that he couldn't handle raising a ""r******"" (the only thing wrong with her is hearing). I don't want my child to grow up in a home where she's hated. I was starting to hear all sorts of crap from my family and his, who started to take his side because divorce isn't really a thing here, so I took action. I made a social media post publishing the text messages so that people would finally see the truth. I'm now getting calls and messages for ""making a private issue public"" and ""parental alienation"". AITA?"
199,Not the A-hole,AITA for saying my secret workout routine is depression?,26684,k58bog,1559,"I (25F) had a miscarriage in early January this year. I lost my mother to a completely unexpected heart attack in February. We used to be very very close and her death, coupled with the loss of my child devastated me. I slipped into depression, developed anorexia and lost a huge amount of weight in a very short time. I used to be 165 pounds and now I'm at 120 pounds. I attended my best friend's wedding yesterday (tiny ceremony). It was the first social event I attended this year after my ""transformation"". There was an acquaintance there who seemed enthralled by my body. She's very into fitness but she's not someone I am particularly close and she kept asking me about diet plans and said that she needed to know my ""secret workout routine"" for her clients. I politely deflected the questions at first and said something along the lines of ""I just was not in a good place, lost my appetite and it just happened"". But she kept pestering me and said I should help other people lose weight too. I lost my patience and told her that ""I actually developed an eating disorder and severe depression. I don't think your clients would like this routine"". She made a face and left me alone for the day. I thought this would be the end of it.Turns out, after the celebrations were over, she went and complained to my best friend's husband (she's his sister) and he called me and asked me to apologise for ""embarrassing his sister on his wedding"".

Her and her husband had been discussing getting a house keeper to help clean the windows and bathrooms since she said it took a long time.  I was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. Out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. She got defensive and upset, which i wasn't expecting. She said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so I can see how long it takes her if I want to know so badly. So, I did. I got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. Sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. Then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later I was done. I guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what I did in half an hour.  She once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that ""fine I lied about how long it takes because I HATE cleaning those!"" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.&#x200B;I noped out of there fast as I could. I didnt mean to expose a lie, i was just trying to understand my sister more. WITAH?"
201,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my sister to stop telling people that she has my illness to gain sympathy for being overweight?,26665,gl3ib7,1464,"I (22f) have an older sister (25f). My sister is very sensitive about everything. When we were young, if I made the smallest comment like ""I prefer pink over blue"" it would make her cry because she thought I was aiming at her by saying it. My parents would always ask me to apologise to her since she's sensitive and I'm ""emotionally stronger"" than her. My parents never controlled my sister's diet growing up, letting her have what she wants since they found it too difficult to control her. I was skinny as a stick when I was a kid, so even though my family has a long history of thyroid disease my parents didn't think there was an issue with me. However, my sister has been overweight the majority of her life, so my parents thought she'd be the one with the thyroid issues. They took us to an endocrinologist when I was 10. I got a diagnosis for Hashimoto's Thyroiditis while my sister didn't, and instead got told to exercise and watch her diet. I got hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's, and have been on medication ever since. My sister and I moved back in with our parents due to what's happening these days. I leave my medication in a cabinet near the kitchen since I know I won't take it unless I have to actually get out of bed to do so. Apparently, I left a box before I moved out of my parents house when I was a teen and one of her friends saw it while they were over and asked if it was hers. My sister told them that it was, and that's why she was overweight. The box has ""Euthyrox"" written on it in big bold letters with a little picture of a thyroid gland next to it. So yeah, pretty obvious it was meant for a thyroid condition. She's held up this farce for almost 4 years. I only figured it out when I saw her take a box of it out of my bag one day. I confront her on it, and she starts crying and telling me that she just didn't want anyone to mean to her because she's fat. She also says that it's not fair that the one with the normal weight gets the thyroid disease.I'm just staring at her gobsmacked. She's complaining that she doesn't have an auto immune condition? I tell her to knock it off, and that she can't lie to get sympathy from people. My parents talk to me later, and they say that I was too harsh calling her a liar and she probably needs a therapist or something and the classic ""I should apologise since I'm more mature"". They even tell me that they were hoping that she was the one with the thyroid issues as a child, so that they could justify her weight gain. I ask them ""so you wanted your daughter to be sick instead of admitting that it's your fault because you bought her mcdonalds whenever she wanted it, and never made her exercise?"" Now they're mad at me too."
202,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my parents they made my sister getting pregnant ruin my life?,26632,gekfhn,3824,"shes 23f im 18F. Grandma died 8 years ago, and she left more than enough money to pay for all her grandkid's colleges educations with a few stipulations: dont get arrested, do drugs, be a drunk, get pregnant / get someone else pregnant. The money was put into accounts in the parents names since we were all kids then.In sophomore year my sister got pregnant. Shit hit the fan panicking about college, the baby daddy left & she hasnt tried to find him/get child support, & the stress from that caused a hard complicated pregnancy. both are ok.Mom * dad still let her go to college as long as she didnt have another and maintained a 3.5 gpa. which she did. She graduated last December with about 2 grand in debt, I figured her money must have been used to help raise her kid and pay for her pregnancy the past 2.5 years so she had to get a bit of a loan. which seemed understandable.Boy I was wrong! I got accepted to my dream college on the other side of the state, but mom kept trying to get me to go to a cheaper one near home so I dont need a dorm and it would be a cheaper school. I asked her why she was so insistent, grandma left plenty of money i thought. Turns out, they flushed all the money that was supposed to go to me down the toilet to take care of my sister & her kid & her expensive pregnancy, turns out was a lot worse than I was led to believe.I broke down and just lost it crying harder than I ever have. Shouting how they fucked me over and ruined my life for the kid that fucked up. now I'll have at least 70k debt if I go to school. I guess this upset my sister and she asked in a very upset tone if id rather her be out on the streets destitute and unable to care for her kid(who she 'reminded' me was a living being) because she didnt have an education/support system just so I could go on to college and have a good life.I said yes, how its not fair that she got to fuck up, get drunk and sleep with so many guys she doesnt know who the baby daddy is(something she told me but apparently not mom or dad), kept breaking rule after rule while I havent ever even had sex with my bf. And now Im the one that has to be punished for it.everything just keep devolving in to more yelling/fighting until I left. Ive been staying with my bf for the past few days. I know with the rona i shouldnt gp anywhere but i just wanted to be with the one person i feel like actually gives a damn about me.moms been texting/calling trying to get me to come home, saying if i can just be reasonable and not vilify my sister we can probably work something out. I told her unless she has money grandma left for me dont talk to me until I have my college loans paid off in 50 years.Did I go too far? A lot of it was driven by emotion but i really feel fucked over here and like im being punished despite being the one that followed the rules.I've since slept with my bf, i figure if Im getting punished same as if i would have broken all the rules i can at least have fun.3000 char limit is an AHEDIT: been texting sis some this morning to try and mend stuff with her since i didnt think mom and dad spending the money was her fault. she was told about it after she graduated and was asked to keep me in the dark. She has offered to pay for 'a book or two' but not more since she wants to move out to 'get out from under mom and dad's thumb'. probably to party again since she doesnt hide how much she misses it.edit 2: there was a bit left after sis got done at college and was told about it all. They decide to use it to get her a car so she'd be able to get to work. and she went along with it.... now im pissed at all 3 again.EDIT 3: emailed my copy of the will to the  laywer. he says due to how it was set up he cant be certain right now we have a case but theres a good shot.EDIT 4: lawyer says they may have violated the trust grandma set up so hes contacting a trust lawyer friend of his to help make sure hes reading it all rightedit 5:(holy shit so many edits sorry!) auntie got back to me. Shes mad at my parents. when she called to see what was going on all they did was (her words) try to justify it. Turns out dad and mom offered to pay for an abortion and sis didnt want one(understandable i wouldnt ether but still dont always get what we want). and sis thought going on government assistance was trashy and refused. so mom and dad felt like this was the only way to keep her 'safe'. She says they still arent sorry and mom said shed do it again if she had to do it all over. and of course as you might imagine they're mad at me for telling people. But since its just making others mad at the mim just laughing at this point."
203,Not the A-hole,"AITA for having security at my mother's funeral, having certain people barred entry?",26616,ejuz1p,2321,"My parents divorced ten years ago, my father initiated it. He was seeing someone else and wanted to see if the grass was greener on the other side. I neither am for or against his reasoning but I was against how he treated my mother after they finalized their separation. One key event that stands out is in deliberating how assets (or rather, debt) was divided, my father promised my mother that he'd still around, still be in her life, even be friends, and see if they could rekindle their marriage, but only if my mother took every penny of debt. My mother was naive to agree to it, because once the divorce was finalized, my father was on a plane in a matter of days, off to live his new life. It should be obvious that none of us were happy with my father, and I've been no contact the entire time.My mother passed three weeks ago. She is survived by my two siblings and I. I was in charge of the funeral. I knew some of my cousins on my mother's side blamed my mother for their divorce and actively stayed in touch with my father. Imagine that, my mother's family took my father's side in all of this. I also knew there would be a nonzero chance my father would show up, and if he did, it would not be to pay his respects. So I hired security for the funeral and church service.Long story short, my father and his new wife showed up. They were barred entry. One of my aunts got very upset and caused a scene and let slip her daughter, my cousin, invited him. So I had security escort my cousin out of the funeral, too. This event has caused a rift between families, or at least embiggened the one already there. A few of my aunts and a lot of my cousin think I went overboard, some even removing me from Facebook.Was I the asshole in this situation? For what it's worth, I was not super close to those who were ejected from the funeral, nor the ones who caused a fuss. I can live a happy life having zero contact with them again, so I've lost nothing. I'm still no contact with my father (who flew out for the funeral).edit: I appreciate the awards but this is a throwaway account. Why award a throwaway with anything?There's nothing I'm really hiding here. I was the one who knew about the affair because my father left his e-mail open at home when he went off to work, and me being an immature teen decided to snoop. In them, his mistress-now-wife tried to convince him of fantasy things my mother did and tried to turn him against her. Things like she would ask my dad something my mother did to him that was maybe insignificant at the time and twisted it around so it became a bigger deal.Like one instance is when I was much younger, my mother went to bingo without telling him. My dad was the sole income maker at the time. My mom won a fair bit of money but my dad was upset she never told him she went beforehand (with his money). Something that was resolved 10 years prior and which was insignificant in the grand scheme of things, she blew it up to bigger than it was. Many such cases like this she blew things up to convince him to leave my mom.This is why I don't fault my dad for the divorce or separation: I fully blame the other woman. It sucked being 17 at the time but that's life, people get divorced, and it's not my place to get in the middle of my parents' relationship. However, I was upset with his behavior after the fact and the one event I mentioned. Much of my mom's extended family are more *traditional* and view divorce as a tragedy no matter the circumstances. They blame my mom for not ""trying harder"" to keep the marriage together. Once the divorce was finalized, my mother became an outcast to most of her family. This is why a lot of them favored my dad because he convinced my mom that she was why their marriage fell apart. He was a textbook manipulator."
204,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my girlfriend she isn’t welcome at my house anymore unless she seriously fixes her attitude regarding my best friend?,26592,inoaua,1305,"Disclaimer: no, I am not seeking relationship advice or validation on it. I am seeking judgement on refusing to let her come to my house. I (30M) live with my best buddy Mark (30). We decided 2 years ago, we were sick of paying high rent costs and having shitty roommates so we pooled our money together to put a deposit down on a house. It’s a good arrangement as we both have our own separate spaces, it’s cheaper paying a mortgage and we do everything jointly. We’ve also been best friends for 20+ years and enjoy living together. It’s also important to note that I am straight and Mark is gay, but this has never bothered me and it doesn’t impact how I see him. Mark is single after a breakup right now and I’ve been seeing Hannah (was seeing her?) for about a year. I told her right from the start about my living arrangements so in case she ever came to my house, she knew Mark lived there too. It never seemed to be an issue until Mark and his boyfriend broke up and Hannah’s attitude changed. She started making comments saying she was uncomfortable with him around me and that he was “making eyes” at me a lot. I told her she was being ridiculous, so did Mark and we both laughed at the idea of being into each other. We’re complete opposites and are more like brothers and it weirds us both out that Hannah is making comments.I have told Hannah multiple times to stop as this is Mark’s house too and I won’t have him feeling shitty. Hannah just keeps ramping it up and her comments are getting worse to the point she even said he wanted to make a move on me. I finally snapped. I told her that being gay doesn’t automatically mean he wants to sleep with me and her attitude is disgusting. She said she was joking and I said it didn’t feel like a joke. I told her “if you seriously can’t change your attitude and treat Mark like a person, then you’re not welcome here anymore. You’re 30, act like it. Get out.”Hannah has been calling me an AH for treating her like a child and some of her friends have messaged me saying I am being too harsh. I’m asking for judgement as I may be the AH for being too firm and not trying to talk to her about why she is speaking about Mark this way instead of downright refusing to let her be near him.Update: I have come to the conclusion Hannah and I are no more. Thank you for your comments.Update 2: this post received a lot more attention than I thought. I will happily do an update post for all you lovely people.Final update: love who you love! Gay, straight, bi, pan, whatever, who cares? Love whoever you wanna love and enjoy your lives!!"
205,Not the A-hole,AITA for sending my son to school in a dress,26572,d1jjlx,1458,"My son started second grade last week. I get the kids ready for school while my wife sleeps (she's got a graveyard shift). He's got a twin sister. I told them both it was time to get ready for school and his twin sister pulled a bunch of dresses out of her closet. My son picked one up and said ""I want to wear this."" I'm thinking, whatever dude, we're running late just put some kind of clothes on and let's get out the door. I'm pretty politically neutral so while I wouldn't say I was particularly happy he wanted to wear a dress, it also wasn't nearly as upsetting to me as the idea that I could be late for work if we didn't get out the door. I figured ok, I wouldn't ever tell my daughter not to do something because it wasn't ladylike so I shouldn't tell my son not to do something because it isn't manly. I drop him off and get to work. Three hours later we get a call to come pick up our son because his outfit is distracting to the other kids and he's being bullied. He was very sad when my wife got there and the whole morning had been upsetting for him. My wife is irate asking how I couldn't have realized that was inappropriate and I was setting our son up to fail. So is just about everyone else I've run this by. My wife thinks damage has been permanently done because he'll be in the same school system as these kids the rest of his life and he'll be known as ""the one who wore a dress"" and I was being thoughtless or willfully ignorant because I was in a rush and our son suffered for it. At the time, I truly didn't think it was that big a deal, but that doesn't change that I put my son in harm's way so now I'm not sure whether I made the wrong decision or not or how to feel about it. AITA"
206,Not the A-hole,AITA for not donating my liver due to a lawsuit and the person died?,26571,hysbcq,1802,"My (24M) partner's (23F) close friend and boss (50'sM) at the mechanic shop needed a liver transplant. They had been on the list for a while and getting nowhere. Lots of us got tested and I was a match. We were all happy and thrilled that this direct donation could take place.A week before the surgery date, police showed up at our house to arrest my partner as her boss (person who was getting a piece of my liver) had accused her of theft. Claimed she'd stolen thousands from his bank account and stolen from the cash box. The police showed us the Cctv in which she reaches into the box, takes money and walks out of frame. 15 times, 15 days, 15 accusations. The police admitted they had no proof it was theft and no clue on the amounts taken as she used the box to take customers money and change. The police also said they didn't see how she accessed the bank accounts, and that they felt this was some sort of insurance fraud and they needed a scape goat.I immediately rang the hospital and my transplant coordinator and backed out of the surgery. We got on with our lives, partner found a new job and attended the court date where the case was thrown out 6 months later. A week after the case was dismissed, we got word boss had died. No one else had been a match or willing to get tested after news got out, and they never found a match in the transplant system in time.I feel so guilty. I allowed someone to die, pretty much murdered them. I let pettiness get in the way of saving a life. Partner and friends feel I did the right thing, none of this is on me and not giving a piece of me to the person possibly putting my partner in prison for a long time, a week before surgery, is my choice and the right choice. Bosses friends and family have been ringing non-stop, harassing us at our jobs and posting online a lot how I'm a murderer and killed boss. That I should have given the liver anyway and been a good person. I feel I should have given it, but who bites the hand that feeds? I didn't want to get cut open, risk dying and other complications for someone who didn't care for me and mine, but now someone is dead from something I could have prevented. I'm conflicted and losing sleep over this. AITA for not giving my liver to the person accusing partner of theft and them later dying?Edit: thank you for all the positive and informative feedback. I think seeing the outside, impartial view on this has helped me put it in perspective. I've only been focusing on my selfishness causing his death, as opposed to his actions contributing too. I'll be getting some counselling, as suggested, to help deal with the constant what ifs in my brain and to help me move past this and to stop shouldering the burden.Edit: Well, this blew up. Thanks for the awards and positive vibes everyone, much appreciated. Clearing up a few things- gf didn't steal, she was just doing her job getting change/paying invoices. The wife (who admitted to stealing later) simply used footage of her accessing the cash box to try to make it seem like she stole. I didn't state she was innocent as its innocent until proven guilty, and she wasn't found guilty, my mistake. - it's been pointed out that with boss so unwell, perhaps it wasn't him doing this, but his wife. That's a great point I never considered, and now makes me feel even more guilty. I should have checked.- we are in the UK so I guess our legal system works differently to the States in that I didn't have to pay a bail, just simply take her home and take her to the court dates. This could be why the policemen told us straight it seemed like bull and were very candid and kind to us; they even bought us lunch when one went to Subway.- also as said, the surgery would have probably been cancelled anyway as I did have another welfare check (or two) scheduled for that week with the transplant team at the hospital and I was hugely stressed out. My work gave me that week and the following off anyway for being such a good sport.- thanks for the dm's calling me a murderer, appreciated...."
207,Not the A-hole,AITA for not inviting the neighborhood snitch or the HOA board to our neighborhood BBQ?,26458,fkrfu6,1677,"There's around 10 houses in my neighborhood of 120 that are not in the HOA, mine included. We (or previous owners) were smart enough to not join the HOA. As a result, i am able to make extensions and I have a pool, which I host neighborhood parties occasionally. My HOA is one of the worst HOAs, constantly fining people hundreds of dollars for parking violations, painting their fences the wrong shades of brown, wrong  color curtains, having 2 flags etc. They're not the worst HOA but they're bad. We also got a shitty neighbor, Jessica, who likes to go around and snap photos of people's violations and then post it on the next-door app to shame them. She prides herself in this thinking it makes the neighborhood better when she shames the Smiths for having a fence thats 2 inches too high, or the Johnsons for having light brown door instead of a dark brown door. Jessica is a fucking cunt, she's probably cost neighbors thousands of dollars in fees or forcing them to renovate. I absolutely lost my shit when Jessica posted in the next door app about how Mrs Jenson (85 year old woman, currently having serious medical issues) has a lawn thats a couple inches too high. She obviously can't mow the lawn and was too busy to notice. The HOA then fined her 500 dollars.I made a post in the next-door app about the next-door app saying that the suburban fascists on the HOA nor Jessica were invited to my BBQ at my house. Jessica went on a ran saying how much of a angel she is and how she protects the neighborhood doing her duty and I told her she's a low life scumbag busybody and is a pathetic loser with nothing better to do. A couple people said I was bullying and excluding her and like 4 of her friends are ""boycotting"" my party and hosting their own party. The party happened and nobody else showed up to theirs and ours was a blast. She apparently cried over it.EDIT: did not expect this post to blow up like that, thanks for the awards and the comments.

208,Not the A-hole,AITA for not allowing my father to meet my dying mother at the hospital?,26448,e2nxtz,4124,"I'm a 25 year old guy and my parents were in the process of divorcing when my mother got diagnosed with a terminal illness. After the diagnosis, my father stalled the divorce proceedings. My father filed for divorce after 26 years of marriage after he fell in love with his younger business partner. She recently gave birth to his child. My mother was a stay at home mom for 25 years who took care of the entire household while my father worked long hours. She was blindsided when my father told her about wanting a divorce. He told her that he would always love her as his best friend and as the mother of his 5 children, but he was also in love with this other woman. My mother was devastated and stopped eating properly. In the middle of the divorce, she was diagnosed with terminal illness and was only given a few months to live. All this time, we, her children have looked after her. I took her to her appointments and we paid for the treatment by taking loans. We didn't ask our father for money, even though he was willing to cover the expenses. Legally, at the time of her death she was still married to my father. During her last days, my father had to move to another city to be there for his daughter's birth. My uncle made a facebook post asking for blood donation (she has a rare blood type) and stated that she was critical. When my dad got to know about it, he immediately flew down to our city. When he showed up to the hospital, he was in a bad shape. His clothes were unkempt. He wanted to see my mother one last time. I told him that there was no use of that as she was unconscious. He begged and cried in front of everyone, I still didn't allow him to meet her. (The hospital authorities let her family decide who was allowed to visit her) My mother passed away the next morning. He still didn't leave and wanted to be there for the funeral and memorial service. We banned him from attending.I believe that he lost the right to see her in her pain when he was the one who caused her immeasurable pain. My buddy tells me that me and (my mother's family) are the assholes for not letting him see her one last time. ---------Edit : I want to make some facts clear -1) When my father told my mother that he was in love with his business partner and wanted a divorce, the other woman was already pregnant with his child. 2) I was/am her legal representative (edit : Power of Attorney, to make things clear ). I had the legal right to deny visitors. My mother's entire family supported me in my decision to not let him see her. My grandma wanted the same. My siblings wanted the same.-------------Edit 2 :3) During her last days, when she was in the hospice, she got to a stage where she could no longer communicate verbally. And she never expressed anything about wanting our father there. In fact, she didn't mention him at all. 4) I realize that this means the end of my relationship with our father. I have accepted that and I have no interest in pursuing a future relationship with him, his new woman or his child. My siblings are on the same page.We have accepted the fact that we have lost two parents forever.I plan to be there for my younger siblings as their pillar of support."
209,Not the A-hole,AITA for acting like a conspiracy theorist to get out of political arguments with my Dad?,26444,egncbw,1576,"My Dad loves to have political arguments/“discussions” with me and other members of the family. I honestly think he does not care about half these issues and just wants to have fights with me and other people in the family. I have tried to simply opt out of them, but my Dad will get upset at me for “not participating with the family dynamic” and “never talking to him.” I also don’t really want him to have these discussions with other members of my family, since they almost always end up in hurt feelings. I’ve been looking for a redirect for a while. I read a post online on doubling down whenever someone says a conspiracy theory, for example if someone says “they faked the moon landing” you say “haha, you sucker, you believe the moon is real?” I decided to implement the strategy after getting into way too many political arguments and upsetting myself and everyone around me.My Dad saw something about climate change and started talking about how the Chinese government partnered with Obama to make it all up. I truly did not want to get into this political discussion. Instead I said, “oh, you’ve heard that, well get this” and discussed my new theory about how the federal government has created a tornado machine to set on people who want to vote Republican in the next election. He was truly flabbergasted at how stupid this was and decided to stop talking to me about this. It was wonderful. I’ve been doing it even more, and I haven’t had a political argument in a whole month. This Christmas, he had a doozy planned. My aunt and her wife are feminist and very pro-choice. At the dinner table, he tried to do a toast to the “death of Planned Parenthood.” Let me note that he is pro-choice, really doesn’t care about this issue, and has said so several times. I think he just wanted to start a fight for the sport of it. Time and place! I said, “oh, thank God you mentioned it, I have to tell you this news I learned” and I talked about how Planned Parenthood does not in fact perform abortions, since it’s physically impossible, but instead removes entire uteruses and replaces them with dog uteruses. I received a lecture about “not taking people’s political views seriously” from my Mom. I said it was just a strategy I use to diffuse political discussions. My Mom said, “you’re just making yourself look dismissive at best and insane at worst.”"
210,Not the A-hole,AITAH for giving guardianship of my son to my aunt over my mother after I die of my terminal cancer,26434,h8ditf,937,"I (21m) have a son who just turned 1, his mum who was my girlfriend died in labour along with the other baby she was carrying. I was diagnosed with terminal cancer 3 months ago and I don't have very long left (two months at most) I have accepted that I'm going to die but now I have to think about what's best for my son.I had to decide who my boy would go to and I thought my mother(55) naturally but then I started to think of her situation as my older(29) lives with her along with his 5 kids all aged under 5 and I decided not to as mum works and my brother tbh isn't really raising his kids, more dragging them up and can be neglectful. I wasn't going to put my son in that environment as I want someone to actually care for him. So I then thought of my aunt(33) on my dads side. she is a good mother and her husband a good father to their 3 girls and I know they could provide for my son. I asked them and they agreed.My mother however found out that I wasn't leaving my son with her and she got angry with me, that she's loosing me and now loosing her grandson. I gave her my reasons and that she realistically can't raise him while she's basically raising a man-child and his kids. It all ended in an even bigger argument and now I'm cooling off at home. I understand that things are terrible for her right now as I won't be here soon but my aunt is a much better choice.

211,Not the A-hole,AITA For asking my GF to pay for a new prosthesis?,26421,ieksvk,3184,"I (M24) had an auto accident over 2 years ago that resulted in a left leg knee amputation, I thought that would been the end of my active lifestyle, I loved all kinds of sports as a kid and I still do.I had a very hard time adjusting to my new normal, my parents were able to get me a prosthetic leg that allowed me to get back to running and going trips with my friends like we always do every summer.The guys were planning an RV trip on the weekend, we had already chosen a destination which was spending some time out in nature and getaway from stress.My girlfriend asked if she could come along, I told her no, this is a guy's trip, Told all my buddies' girlfriends wanted to go but they were firm and put their foot down, she laughed at me for this Then tried to convince me to let her come cause she was feeling stressed out from being at home 24H, I already made up my mind, I wasn't going to ruin the trip just because she wants to be on a guy's trip, I promised her a trip when I get back, she got upset and didn't like the idea.Later on, before I went to sleep, I took my prosthesis off as I do every night, this is my second prothesis, I've already completed a wearing schedule during first year and had to get another prothisis to accommodate any physical changes I had.I woke up in the morning and I couldn't find my prosthesis, I looked where I put it but it was gone, I asked my girlfriend who was doing heavy cleaning around the place, and she said she didn't see it, I was confused it was near my bed, I asked her to stop being childish and playing games and give back my prosthesis because I knew she took it.She's a bad liar couldn't even deny it, she said she wanted to hide it so that I won't go on that trip and leave her alone. I got mad at her for this, I was stunned to find my prosthesis hidden underneath an auto part in the garage, it had been damaged, it was placed in a possession where it had a crack, it was abvious it no longer functions properly, I mean I could still wear it but can't put my whole weight on it cause it would break.I yelled at her and showed her what she did, she said she didn't mean it, I told her she did mean it because she was being childish and jealous over a trip and now she caused me 7000$ worth damage, I told her she ruined everything, that she owed me a new one and that she needed to pay for a new one.She got mad and left, I basically had to use my old crutches it felt absolutely horrible, I called the guys and told them I wasn't coming, it's been a few days, she's mad that I'm still asking her to pay for a new prosthesis and called me an a**** for not apologizing and preferring a ""plastic leg"" over her.I had to call my parents today to tell them they told me she should at least help pay half the expense of a new prosthesis since she caused damage to it, and then consider my relationship with her.Have I been an a**** to her ?Edit: for those asking about where I am, I'm in Asia, From Philippines."

We live in India, Shanaya is an Indian name. I am ALSO Indian. I did not ""pick a black sounding name to make this post sound racist"" or whatever nonsense people on r/amitheangel are spewing and DMing me about. Surprise surprise! People of other ethnicities, religions and nationalities exist, we have names that are not Christian or white sounding, not everyone in this world is  John or Kristen or Micheal or whatever. I don't care if you think this post is fake, but to assume that just because here is a name you are not familiar with you think I am bound to be racist, it makes you racist yourself.&#x200B;I live in a not so well off area. I am not well of by any means, but I have a wifi connection. My wifi has a 4 device limit, its the cheapest plan they have. My neighbours have a 12 year old daughter who has to attend online classes, I know her well because she comes over fairly often to hang out with my daughter as they are friends. Her name is Shanaya. Shanaya's parents told her they cannot afford wifi, so she asked me if she can use mine. I agreed, and said the only condition was that she has to study hella hard and do her best. She agreed and has been using it for a while. Over the past 2 months, I have been finding it hard to use my wifi. The web portal for the wifi says 4 devices are constantly connected to it when all I am using is my phone and my daughter is using her laptop. Sometimes, my daughter can't connect to her own classes and uses data.I asked Shanaya about it last week, and she said her parents forced her to tell them the password and that they have been using it. I went and spoke to her parents about it, and said that it is only for her to be able to attend classes. They said they will stop using it. But over the week, 4 times my daughters classes got interrupted because there were multiple devices trying to use it. Yesterday, Shanaya told me that our other neighbors also have the password and are also using it, that her parents gave it to them. I went and warned her parents again, said I will change the password, but they made false promises again and shut their door. I changed the password and gave shanaya the new one, but her parents forced it out of her again.My daughters education needs to take priority, her classes are important. I can't let her education take a backseat, but if I change it again and not give shanaya the password, her education will get affected. WIBTA if I change the password and not tell Shanaya?&#x200B;&#x200B;"
213,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking if my cousin made her first million yet?,26330,knpbi5,1361,"Hello friends, I'm from the future. Throwaway, yada yada.Well, technically we're a few hours away from 2021. So advanced happy new year.I'm currently outside on our terrace while my family is gathered in the livingroom after having asked me to step outside for a bit, because apparently I've ruined the mood. I'm turning to you guys to ask if I'm the asshole for what I just did.Family from all over the city has gathered to celebrate the new years. Covid is thankfully low in my city and we've taken the necessary precautions.As is typical of Asian family reunions, the old people in the family love to 'check up' on their nieces and nephews. One of my aunt's A, loves to show off her kids' achievements, particularly her daughter Pat. While listing off her daughter's achievements (passing the bar, recently getting married to a fellow lawyer), my aunt turned to me and asked what I've achieved in 2020. She began to list off all my lack of achievements, like how I'm thirty and still unmarred (I'm a dude, if that matters), about how I'm still living at home with my parents and how I'm still driving my shitty 2000-something civic. My other cousins joined in on the jeering and listed all the other failed aspects of my life. Now, I graduated with a degree in architecture, but after multiple attempts just can't seem to pass the exam. This has been a point of contention in the family because my other cousins are lawyers, teachers, etc, whatever. These days I basically work freelance from home. I don't know why, but my aunt's condescending voice got to me and I said ""I made my first million this year. Has Pat made her first million yet?"" Then turning to my cousins I asked the same, ""You guys made your first million yet? Because I have."" The room fell silent. I basically killed the mood. My dad asked me to go outside and relax because apparently I might have just ruined everyone's new year celebration.Was I an asshole?P.S. First million in our local currency not USD."
214,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my parents they were bad parents to me?,26304,kqg77y,1358,"I (19M) have an autistic brother (20M). He’s fairly manipulative because he realized pretty quickly that the threat of a meltdown would get him his way every single time. He is considered high functioning by medical personnel, but he’s got my parents convinced he just doesn’t understand what he’s doing, and they don’t ever punish him. Doctors have told them that he understands and that he knows what he’s doing. They think they know better. They also expect me to revolve my entire life around him. I was never able to do anything I wanted because it upset his routine. I wanted to play a sport, nope his routine. I wanted to get a job? Nope, his routine. Friends? Yeah forget about that. I tried not to be resentful, but I am.The problem: My parents are flipping out because I plan to move several states away and in with my grandparents soon to attend school. They keep trying to guilt me into staying because of my brother. I usually just say that I’m sorry that they feel that way, but I’m still going. Well here’s where I might be the asshole. My mother was going on and on about how the world doesn’t revolve around me and how I was being really selfish and how I was going to ruin my brother by doing this. How they’d always been the best parents they could be to both of us and we both got equal attention.I got frustrated and told her that she was delusional if she thought she or my father were ever good parents to me. They made my life revolve around my brothers, I had nothing of my own, he had to be the center of everything. I said He wasn’t the center of the universe even though she tried to make him it. I told her that the only people who were selfish were her and my father because they actively ignored me in favor of babying my brother who played them like a fiddle to make sure he always got his way. I told her that his routine was not my problem, that it was up to them to make the appropriate adjustments, and asked if she really thought I’d just not live my life because of him?She started crying and I walked off and shut myself in my room. My father is demanding an apology for what I said, but I’m refusing. My grandpa said he’s proud that I stood up for myself, but my parents are still demanding an apology for being an asshole. I don’t think I need to give them one. AITA here?"
215,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking a 47 year old man who is dating my 22 year old niece some pointed questions that made him “uncomfortable”?,26304,dpppvj,3358,"Using a throwaway. Some context; I live in CA, and my wife’s niece wanted to come visit us for a few weeks. She’s 22, I’ve known her since she was 4. Her dad walked out on her family when she was 8. She’s very sheltered by her mother. Anyway, I told my wife it was fine with me if she visits. She’s a good kid, and our 5 year old son loves his cousin and really wanted to see her.But then my wife goes, “And she (the niece) wants to bring her bf.....he’s 47.”I’m 41, my wife is 42. I was like “You’re kidding, right?”She wasn’t kidding. At first, I was like “Hell no.” But after about a week of talking, I gave in....with one caveat. I told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, I’m going to ask some questions he might not like. She wanted to know what kind of questions, and I gave her some.1. How did you guys meet and who made the first move? (If the dude made the first move, it’s weird).2. Has the dude been married, does he have kids?3. Why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?4. Are you (the dude) aware of the young woman’s history with her father? 5. What’s the end game here? A serious relationship, marriage? Have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?I know, I’m not the girl’s father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. Her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). So, fast forward to the visit. Niece and old dude show up. I’m cordial. I wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and I invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. Just me and him. Then I start asking my questions. After only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. He told me this is “None of my business.” I got a little pissed at that. I told him he’s staying in my home for a week, I can ask him a few questions. And the girl is my niece, I’m not out of bounds here. He told me I was making him “uncomfortable”. I replied that I’m uncomfortable having a dude who’s clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. I said You can answer my questions and act like you’re a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.Well, he left. My wife and niece were upset with me. They said I acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. Again, I was told it’s none of my business. They have since broken up, which I am glad about. Not sure if my actions were the cause.So Am I an asshole for questioning this guy?EDIT: some info:I asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got “uncomfortable”.I would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. When I took the old dude outside for a beer, I neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. We discussed the new Star Wars movies of all things.I would love to discuss more with some of you, but I was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. So it goes.Edit 2: Some of you here asked what’s up with my wife and her sister. Her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. They’re wonderful people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.FINAL EDIT: Some of you wondered if I would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. Of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and I wouldn’t have a problem. Talked to my niece this morning. She and I are totally fine. Knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. I apologized for my actions regardless. Asked why they broke up.The guy was cheating on his wife. He confessed it to her and said he would get a divorce for her. Has three kids. All her age or older. She dumped him."
216,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking out my sister after she sabotaged a meeting with a fertility clinic?,26274,iotv4b,1563,"8 years ago, my (29f) sister (32f) got pregnant. The father wasn't involved and my sister didn't want the baby, but she also couldn't bring herself to terminate or adopt out to strangers. She approached me and my (now ex) husband, and asked if we would be willing to adopt her child. We weren't sure as we were concerned this would lead to issues down the line but my sister insisted that it wouldn't so we ultimately agreed. Before Lucy was a year old, my husband left us both because my sister lied about Lucy's father.When Lucy was 4, I got together with my wife, and we married last year. My sister has said that seeing me and my wife with Lucy (who is now 7) confirms to her that she made the right decision.When I first adopted Lucy, my husband and I told my sister that we wanted multiple children, which she said she was fine with at the time, but now my wife and I are looking into our options and my sister objects.My sister has been staying with us since July because her boyfriend kicked her out.She keeps asking Lucy if she's sure she wants siblings (Lucy has said that she does), and telling us she's worried we won't be able to give Lucy what she needs, and then today happened.We had an online consultation with a fertility clinic to talk about sperm donation. We told my sister about it and asked her to keep an eye on Lucy while we talked. The wifi went randomly on and off 3 times during the session, booting us out of the call each time. The third time, my wife went to check it and saw my sister holding the power cord, and Lucy trying to plug it back in. Lucy saw my wife and said ""auntie keeps turning the wifi off"". Wife plugged it back in, but we could no longer get into the session and we got an email from the doctor saying that if the wifi is going to be this bad then maybe we should try a more local clinic as we can't do online consultations.When we confronted my sister she admitted that she wants Lucy to be an only child so she has 100% of our undivided attention, and then said in a sarcastic tone ""forgive me for only wanting what's best for my daughter"" to which we responded that Lucy isn't her daughter. Things escalated until I said that my sister should go stay with our parents, and my wife drove her to their place.Since leaving (a few hours ago) she's apologised and begged to come back, and my parents have also asked me to take her back, but I've refused. They've all called me an arsehole for kicking my own sister out after one argument, because now she's unable to get to work (no car and too far to walk) and she's back in her childhood room while at our place she had a studio to herself behind the house.AITA?"
217,Not the A-hole,AITA for secretly feeding my sister vegetables?,26269,duadu9,3140,"My sister is 16 and heavily overweight. She's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. She's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. Diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! I'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of ""fun"" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the EDM and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely HATED it all. The other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in ""acceptable"" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.As a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago I decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. For breakfast I made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the ""green"" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. I make ""cheese"" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. I mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. I have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.It was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. She started this whole argument about how it was ""unethical"" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where I told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (She thinks apple pie is healthy???) My mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but I really think I was making an honest effort to help? I feel bad for yelling at my mom but I dunno, was I really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?**EDIT:** I really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. I just want to emphasize that I'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, I just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. I will try to be more self-informed in the future. I've taken note of her possibly having ARFID, thyroid problems, or PCOS and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up. Also, my mom is really hard-headed but she's still trying, I feel bad that I've made such a horrible impression of her. She has type 1 diabetes that she has to manage on top of her job and taking care of us 2 kids so please don't say she's terrible :( Also, everyone asking me for my recipes can check my comments, I made a comment on this post detailing how I did the cheese sauce and stuff. Thank you very much for your suggestions, I really appreciate them.**EDIT 2**: My mom has type 1 diabetes, my grandma on my dad's side has type 2. According to the doctor my sister is at risk for Type 2 because of her high blood sugar + high cholesterol."
218,Not the A-hole,"AITA For refusing to listen to my parents and wanting to sue my cousin for a ""prank""?",26258,kiaovf,2619,"I 31M) recently had my cousin M21) move in with me after he got kicked out of his college dorm and had no job to pay for rent. My parents told me I needed to step up and help because I own a house, live alone with my two golden retrievers and two birds that I had since last year. My cousin would make fun of me whenever I call my pets ""family"" and thinks I'm crazy. He has a bad sense of humor and thinks he's funny. He calls me funny nicknames like robot/terminator/optimus prime and others because I wear a prosthetic leg that I've gotten after I had an infection *2 years ago.I been patiant with him causing a mess and not even doing his own laundry it's been 3 months and it's too much already. So Recently he started doing pranks and using personal things in his pranks. Like clothes/my phone/stuff from the kitchen etc. I usually take off my prosthesis before going to bed and since I work all day I got to bed early unlike him he stays up til 3-4am. He decided to do a prank and hid my prosthesis somewhere.I saw that it was gone in the morning (*he did it twice before and hid it in his room and the garage) I had enough of his bullshit I asked him where he took it and he joked and said that it was inside the fridge I was livid. I started screaming at him to stop it and to tell me where my prosthesis was before I kick him out. He realized I was being serious and told me that it was in the attic I let him go get it and when he brought it to me he looked worried and started apologizing when I saw the socket had cracks, the adjustment pyramid and pylon were damaged. He told me he hid it under the old tv and didn't think it was this fragile. It was there overnight so the damage has already been done. I lost my shit I yelled at him while all he did was apologize saying it was just a prank ""bro"" which made it worse I told him to leave and called my aunt to tell her about what her son did and that she needed to pay for the damages. her reaction was shocking. she said that it was my fault because I knew how her son is and decided to take him in anyway and that she won't take responsibility for his actions. I told her I'd seriously sue because I'm broke and have no money to pay for a prosthesis and crutches are unbearable. I was so angry. I kept lashing out at everyone. Especially my mom and dad who argued with me and said that I can't sue ""family"" and this is my cousin and he meant no harm. I told them that he created this situation and needed to fix it. They called me awful for refusing to wait til Christmas is over and family gathering is over then they'll figure something out. I told them to stay out of it but until now they're telling me to not cause an issue we're in the holidays and suing my cousin will make them look bad to everyone. I'm stuck here with crutches feeling awful after they all tried to shut me up and told me to wait til holidays are over then they'll ""raise"" money for me and my cousin gets away with it.EDIT: My dad offered to fix it himself but this is ridiculous he thinks that this is some object like a CD player or a tv he can fix. I called him ridiculous to his face And I didn't let him touch it. He clearly thinks it's no big deal. I stopped taking his calls after that because he doesn't realize how big of an issue this is."
219,Not the A-hole,AITA for dressing nicer than the couple getting married?,26225,cpti8j,4281,"A few months ago, my brother and now SIL announced their intention to marry. The invitation to the wedding stated ""No dress code. Wear whatever is comfortable for you."" In hindsight, I think they put that there since the event was at a lake. I didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, I should dress respectably for such an occasion, and I have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. I chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.Yesterday was the wedding. When I showed up, I noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than I was. I'm talking Polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. I did feel a little out of place. My brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my SIL was wearing a modest white dress. The only comment I got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying I looked like I'm marrying the SIL, but that was it.A few hours ago, I got a call from SIL. Holy shit, she is pissed at me! She was asking why I dressed like a pimp, I upstaged her and my brother, and I stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. I referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and I was dressing respectfully. She was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. I told her that she should've specified ""not formal"" to leave less interpretation freedom. She asked if I was that retarded. I told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. I hung up. She spammed my phone with calls, so I blocked her and texted my brother I'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.Was I in the wrong?Edit: clarified she said I stuck out on the photos.Edit 2: My brother said I'm welcome to come over for dinner later. I unblocked her number. No call spam, so that's a good sign.Edit 3: Had dinner with my brother and SIL earlier. She showed me the pictures, and I can kind of see what she was talking about. I told her I'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because I did notice I was out of place and I should have tried to do something. She said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she's still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head. So yeah, I don't think we're gonna be on Jerry Springer as far as I can tell."
220,Not the A-hole,AITA for banning my father from my home because he banned me from his when I was younger?,26190,i8znou,1909,"When I was 15, my father married a woman I just could not get along with. And there was a lot of friction with her daughter as well.Eventually, the fighting got so bad that my father told me that he would exercise his custody at my grandparents house instead, effectively banning me from his own home.I said thanks but no thanks and stopped seeing him as per the custody schedule.He did make attempts to fix our relationship but I wasn't interested. We would see each other at family events and we were nice enough to each other but that's it.It's now 13 years later and I'm married with a 1 year old.His wife has passed away in an accident a few years ago and I'm assuming he's lonely now.But I don't really want to be his backup plan.He comes to see my son once a month and I only see him at the park and don't engage much with him myself.Last December, he point blank asked me why I never invited him to my home for dinner or why I never accepted his invites to visit him.I told him the the truth. He was very upset but it's the reality of the situation.Was I the asshole?"
221,Not the A-hole,AITA for DEMANDING my SIL replace the expensive fabric she and her children DESTROYED with EQUAL fabric?,26149,e4nn5v,2901,"I am STEAMING mad about this and everyone around me is pretending like I'm being a cunt. I'll let you people decide. First, I sew my own clothes. My husband and I live in a very nice house with a HUGE room filled with gorgeous sunlight for my hobbies.We hosted Thanksgiving. My SIL and her three kids were staying with us, despite that she always treats me like shit for preferring pets over kids.On Tuesday, as I went to do some last-minute shopping, my SIL texted about a tablecloth for her kids to put down while they did Christmas ornaments. I walked her through the closet with the VERY. CLEARLY. MARKED. TABLECLOTHS.I got home 3 hours later and checked in on everyone. When I went into the hobby room where everyone was gathered, I saw it. SHE PULLED MY FUCKING ATELIER BRUNETTE FABRIC FROM THE CLOSET. MARKED. FABRIC. This particular style was discontinued several years ago, but I snagged for $25/yard. I had 6 yards. Let me note that fabric is EXPENSIVE and I have always sourced from thrift stores, deep clearance, etc. This was a GIFT to myself.I fucking screamed ""What the hell are you doing?!"" and ran to the table. She looked alarmed and acted like she had no idea what she'd done. Her fucking kids spilled all kinds of paint all over the fabric. I told everyone to STOP, put DOWN the crafts, and get OUT.After I fucking cried over that fabric and tried my best to salvage it, I demanded she replace it, and said how. She argued that she had no way of knowing that ""ugly ass"" fabric was for something other than a tablecloth, because it didn't look like anything anyone would ever wear seriously. I said I expected 6 yards.Black Friday she and the girls handed me a JoAnn Fabric bag. They handed me 6 yards of an absolutely hideous Keepsake Calico fabric. Typically $9.99/yard but on sale for $3.99 this weekend.I asked her if she was being serious, and she said yes, here's 6 yards of ugly ass fabric. I deadpanned ""Get the fuck out of my house. Now."" and she got very angry and started arguing with me that it's not her fault that I have expensive taste. I told her to leave, now, and not to come back unless she has EQUAL. QUALITY. FABRIC.Of course I'm being told what an awful, evil person I am because I wouldn't ""graciously"" accept her insult of shit quality quilting cotton. For those who don't know fabric, this was like presenting someone with a 2001 Honda Civic after crashing their 2020 Maserati.AITA?**EDITED AT THE REQUEST OF A POSTER:**  To be very clear, SIL had to go *far* out of her way from where I directed her to grab the fabric. It was not even kept in the same room, let alone closet, as the tablecloths which were CLEARLY marked. There was no reason for her to be IN the fabric closet. The was not an ""honest mistake"" by ANY stretch of the phrase. When we were on the phone, I directed her SPECIFICALLY to the linen closet. She had to DELIBERATELY go OUT OF HER WAY to grab the fabric.**SECOND EDIT:**  The linen closet is next to one of the bathrooms, where I directed her. Each shelf is labeled with what they're for, towels, guest towels, bed, guest bed, etc. I said ""You see the shelf marked tablecloths? There's one with paint on it. You can use that."" The fabric closet is in the master bedroom (NOT the craft room even), and each larger cut of fabric is kept inside of a plastic tub, often times in a vacuuum sealed bag, labeled with the yardage, manufacturer, and fiber content.**THIRD EDIT:** Several people seem to have a personal issue with my writing style, use of caps, explanation of my large hobby room, etc! These aren't part of the issue, but seem to really upset some of you. I find that very interesting and wonder if it would be the same if it was a man describing his video game dungeon and battle station! I take a lot of pride in coming from a working class background and having a room dedicated to my hobbies. I hope you all get to enjoy a space of your own eventually as well. <3"

I have pet rabbits, dogs, cats, and a tortoise i like to roam the yard and all of them eat or at least nibble and lick the grass so it’s literally poisoning my pets.So anyway, I kick her the fuck out and take all my pets inside.Now 2 of my rabbits are dead and another is in critical condition. I’ll never be able to let my pets outside again to eat the grass because weedicide takes forever to go away because it can sit in the soil for who knows how long and Im worried that the dogs and cats might end up having a reaction too since they also nibble the grass (call me overprotective or over cautious IDC I love my animals) So I’m suing her for: damage to my property because it is now unusable for my animals, veterinary bills, and emotional damage due to the deaths of my two rabbits.I’m also trying to get the cops to pursue a case of animal abuse or at minimum criminal damage because she did basically poison my animals but I doubt anything will come from it because I have to prove ill-intent but they are pursuing her for criminal trespass. She’s a Karen. I think she deserves it for thinking she had any right to be on my property at all; and especially because it’s killed my pets and now Idk what to do about my lawn because I’m not risking another animal’s life by letting them out (at least unsupervised for at least a year. However my parents and my girlfriend think I’m being unnecessarily cruel because it “was an accident and she thought she was just being a good neighbor, and that Im making it to be a bigger deal than it is” and should just ask for her to pay my vet billsEdit: info, she has asked me about the weeds beforeI don’t remember it verbatim but Basically the conversation was along the lines ofHer: “hey I see you have a lot of dandelions/ weeds have you noticed that too” Me: “yup i enjoy the look of a natural lawn” Her: “Something about my new car.”The endSince she has a kid that she always asks can come over to play with my rabbits I assumed she knew they ate them if she was looking over my fence that often she’d notice the dandelions were only ever flowering in 1/4 of the lawn at a time because my rabbits got cycled in a way that most of the lawn was mostly weed free while the part they couldn’t get to that week would be sproutingEdit again: thanks for the messages guys. Im taking the advise and getting a security camera and a padlock for the fence; also i am in fact getting a necropsy done.Edit edit edit: i have talked to her. Told her that my rabbits died after the fact and there was staining on their pen. She said “it’s weedicide not pesticide; they were probably just sick”Edit edit edit (last edit this is blowing up too much I gotta walk away sorry if i didn’t answer your question) but my rabbits were actually outside when she did this and there was a stain on their pen. I can’t prove it but Im pretty sure they got a direct spray.UPDATE: I got a call from my vet monday morning the necropsy is back my rabbits died from corrosion to several internal organs and had corrosive burns lining their mouth and nose. My 3rd rabbit can also come home today and only has minor injuries to his throat and a small injury resulting in superficial hair loss and mild irritation on his nose. He’ll be on pain meds and just in case I have critical care ready For those without rabbits when rabbits are in pain and sometimes in mourning they sometimes refuse to eat so critical care is basically a mix powder you can syringe feed to keep their digestive system functioning because GI stasis can be life threatening.Also I’ve contacted a lawyer to move forward with a lawsuit, but they haven’t responded, probably won’t until later today because i contacted them yesterday through email. And for the lawn and garden people from my last post the vet thinks the stuff the neighbor used wasn’t a commercial herbicide because of those chemical burns as well as because it killed my crabapple tree and the bit near my fence and pool are bare.Please in the future; avoid messaging me for updates I have no reason to keep you guys updated for any reason; my life and my animals at the end of the day is my business not yours. I will try to keep you updated but remember this is my LIFE. Getting a message every day asking for an update IS RUDE. Also definitely NEVER EVER comment on another one of posts asking for updates or for information that’s just beyond rude STOP IT. Im allowed to make other posts without being reminded of this; you’ll get updates as they come and as I please not as you demand. Thank you."
223,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to cook meat when my husband broke our (lonely) daughter’s only friendship because he hates vegans?,26095,kajk15,2793,"obligatory throwaway because I don’t want angry vegans in my inbox.My husband is from the south and let me just say this, he hates vegans. His family is a stereotypical country one and they get ridiculously mad when they see beyond meat etc adverts on the tv. They’re practically vegan phobic and hate any menu which says suitable for vegetarians or vegans etc. This never really bothered me and I thought it was funny because I ate meat and I didnt think it was a big deal.My daughter (now6) was born allergic to a lot of things, like eggs and is also intolerant to lactose and grass, pollen etc. She rarely got to go to birthday parties because we couldn’t let her eat anything there. when she was a baby my husband ate an egg sandwich and kissed her and she broke out in hives and we had to take her to the doctor. All new foods were tried under medical supervision.While she can eat meat she can’t eat any fun meat like nuggets because of egg contact. One of the kids she recently met with is our new Neighbour who is around four houses away. They are completely vegan and their son doesn’t eat anything they don’t. So at his birthday she could eat the actual  cake and not a muffin I’d sent. It cheered her up and they had play dates even when we weren’t supposed to. I was glad she made a friend.His parents  hadn’t called for a while and didn’t pick up ours. When I saw his dad while I was out I was like ‘hey what’s wrong‘ and he was really hostile, telling me to never talk to him or his wife again and that he’d pray for my daughter. I thought that was crossing the line. He pulled his phone out and showed me a very rude text from my husband. I didn’t believe his story that my husband started a fight, but when I asked him about it he was proud that Shelia wasn’t hanging out with hippies. I remembered the vegan hate and I was like until he apologized to that family and they agreed to let their kid play with ours I’d never cook meat again. He said I needed to get over it and do my Job but I am cooking, just not what he would like. AITAEdit: I will try to find couple’s counseling although I don’t think he’ll agree to it. I hope Ina forgives me (vegan mom, since this blew up, I’m really very sorry and I won’t bother you again.) thank you all for your responses."
224,Not the A-hole,AITA For Refusing To Crochet Something For My Brother's Future Baby After Years Of Teasing?,26059,jwc9l1,2145,"Throwaway AccountI (24m) have never been like the other men in my family. I'm introverted, artistic, and would rather cosplay than play sports. At age 14 my great-grandmother moved in with us and she taught me how to crochet. I loved it but my brothers, Jim (27m) and Tim (27m), used to tease me constantly for it when she wasn't around and whenever I would complain my dad told me that life's full of people that are going to call me names and that I need to ""toughen"" up. I honestly think he was just disappointed that I wasn't an extroverted jock like him and his other sons, felt like he could just pressure me into becoming more like him.When my great-grandmother died she didn't have much but she specifically left me her crochet ""hooks"" and I was very touched. She also left my cousin an unfinished baby socks that she was crocheting for the my cousin's baby, and I could tell my cousin was disappointed. We kind of had this tradition of our great-grandmother making things for the coming babies. I offered to finish what our great-grandmother started, using her hooks, and my cousin was thrilled at the gesture.After that I kinda inherited the position of crocheting things for any new babies in the family and I rather enjoyed it because I felt as if I was carrying on a legacy. Although, it did nothing to stop my mediate family from making jokes and calling me names. Despite the constant attacks against my sexuality Jim, ironically, came out as gay and has since apologized for his past treatment of me so we're on good terms but Tim is still a jerk to me.When I went to college I went low-contact with Tim and my father and would just tolerate them at family events. Last week Tim announced that he and his girlfriend, Tina (24f) were engaged and expecting their first child over social media and everyone was thrilled. During a zoom meeting with the family Tina said she would love a matching blanket, little hat and shoes for the baby from me, and I asked her to send me a copy of her registry for baby clothes. Tim laughed and said everyone knows that it's tradition that I make the items. I told him flat out that he doesn't get to make fun of my skills as a crocheter and then expect free labor from me.My dad said that I was being rude and needed to apologize. I countered that if Tim was hurt by my refusal to crochet for him then he should just ""toughen"" up and get over it and then left the call. Since then I've been getting text messages from my parents and Tim saying that I'm being petty and a jerk to Tina and the baby, but I haven't responded. AITA for refusing to crochet something for my brother's baby after years of teasing?Edit: Okay since I keep seeing this I'm just going to give some info. Yes I am aware that you crochet with HOOKS and not ""needles."" When my great-grandmother was teaching me she referred to them as a ""needle."" Granted she obviously made a mistake but when I was first learning it just stuck so that what I always refer to them personally and I will correct it.Edit For More Info: For more information the last time my dad and Tim made fun of /harassed me crocheting something was last year at Christmas. It's not like they stopped teasing me, calling me rude names, or questioning my manhood when I went to college."
225,Not the A-hole,"AITA for letting my brother call me ""dad"" and refusing to tell him the ugly truth?",26048,ehmsme,1121,"I'm well aware that this story sounds extremely hard to believe and fake, and I'm aware that there will be many ""shitpost"" comments below. Sorry, but this story is 100% true and it is a hot topic of discussion in my family at the moment.I was born when my parents were both 19, and my only other brother (let's call him Josh) was born when they were 42. They divorced shortly after Josh was introduced to the world (he was 4 months old at the time), and they both wanted nothing to do with the child. At the time, I was 23 and I was living alone with my then-girlfriend who was 21 (now my wife), and I done my best to convince at least ONE of them to take care of young Josh for his sake and the family's sake, but they refused adamantly and said that I should be taking custody of him instead. So I became legal guardian of my brother and he's been living with us for the past 12 years and things have been going really smooth for us.Josh, now almost 13, has been calling me ""dad"" and my wife ""mum"" and our two children (4F, 9M) his siblings and he has absolutely NO idea about his real parents, and to be honest, I let all of that slide. He has NO idea that I'm really his blood brother and not his father, and I'm starting to feel guilty and a little weird.Some of my uncles and aunts come to visit occasionally and they are really disgusted at the fact he calls me ""dad"" and they are surprised I haven't told him the truth. They constantly messaged me, talked to me in private and I cannot chat to them without this one particular topic rising up - badgering me to let him know already but I refused.I discussed this with my wife and she thought it would be wrong to tell him the truth because none of my parents wanted to take care of him and I'm the only person in the world who gave him the ""father figure"" everyone deserves.I feel that he has the right to know what he is to me and what I truly am to him, but he's suffered enough already and I just want things to continue how it is. Reddit, AITA? WIBTA if I let him know the truth?**UPDATE**: About 70% of the comments are advising me to tell my son who I really am to him, and some are saying ""sooner than later"". I've just got up to discuss this with my wife and now after a lot of hesitation, we've decided that it's best the truth comes from us and it has to come now. Right now, it's late for us, but we shall address this to him first thing this week, or even tomorrow. Thanks guys."
226,Not the A-hole,AITA for reporting my teacher over a very uncomfortable joke?,26043,gwh6qk,1467,"I (F20) have been in a bakery course since September and every Wednesday we have an 8 hour hands on class. The teacher (M50) is a very friendly man, but his sense of humour is kind of on the edge of acceptable. He'd been making sex jokes about me and some other girls in my class all year, but they were still kind of funny. Last week he called me from the other side of the room saying his friend sent him a video and it made him think of me, as a joke. I approached  him and he gets the video out, everyone else was busy doing their thing. He showed me the video and skips through it. It was a lesbian orgy porn. I got super uncomfortable and froze. I couldn't do anything but chuckle in shock. I laughed it off, didn't say anything about it and went back to what I was doing. I know I should've said something then but I just couldn't. It's been making me lose sleep since last week. I feel grossed out, objectified and my self worth has plummeted. So today I decided to call someone at school who I trust. I told her what happened and that I wanted to arrange a meeting with witnesses where I tell him that he crossed a boundary. But she said she wanted to tell his boss and get an investigation started. Now he's gonna get in trouble because of me, even though I wanted to give him a warning first. AITA for reporting my teacher over a joke?Edit: I thought I'd post this because I had a lot of trouble trying to figure out the things I was feeling. Never in my wildest dreams had I expected this much of a response. Thank you all for your thoughts, upvotes, and the awards. I've gathered some useful information and I feel better knowing that people support me, even though they're strangers on the internet. Thanks guys."
227,Not the A-hole,AITA for putting my dog's wee-wee pads on the bathroom floor b/c my BF has bad aim and keeps missing the toilet?,26031,gdhfdi,4029,"My boyfriend (30/M) and I (28/F) have been together about a year and when our city implemented lockdown for the virus, he decided to quarantine with me at my apartment as I live alone and have a nicer apartment and he has several roommates.Mostly it has been going well and thankfully we both still have jobs, except in the first few weeks I started noticing that the bathroom floor was suddenly always wet around the toilet. (The sink is across the room from the toilet so it's unlikely to be from the sink.) At first I thought it might be water but soon realized that it was definitely pee. I asked BF about it nicely, and he apologized and said sometimes he has bad aim. I asked him to try a little harder and he said sure.The floor continued to be frequently spattered with piss, and a few weeks later I confronted him about it again because I think it's pretty gross to step in his pee several times a week, and it seems like an easy thing to fix. If he misses the toilet, I think the very least he could do is make sure to wipe it up with toilet paper or a Clorox wipe. (The cleaning supplies even live in a cabinet directly over the toilet.) He said sure, sorry, he would try to remember to do that. Another week has passed and while maybe he's doing this sometimes, I've continued to step in splatters of his pee and wipe it off the floor and clean the floor several times a week. I thought about asking him to just pee into the bathtub or something instead, because I don't understand how you can pee on the floor by accident so often and not notice and not clean it up.Last night I got up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and absolutely stepped in piss for the 12312301298th time. I had HAD it and I didn't want to pick a fight or ask him again since it seems clear he can't or won't change, so I got one of my dog's wee-wee pads from when he was a puppy (he is well trained now) and cut it up a bit and taped it down to make a sort of ""skirt"" or mat around the floor near the toilet to at least absorb the piss. BF saw this morning and is FURIOUS with me, saying that I'm calling him a dog, comparing him to an animal, etc. Honestly, I was not thinking that at all, I just was trying to be resourceful and solve the problem for myself since I don't like piss on my bathroom floor and don't like stepping in it, I didn't feel like arguing about it anymore, and putting a material specifically meant to absorb pee around the area he keeps peeing on by accident seemed like a practical solution. AITA?"
228,Not the A-hole,AITA for pressing charges?,26014,jn5elo,3092,"My cousin turned 18 recently. She’s in high school. She doesn’t have a car, and during her birthday weekend, thought her parents were going to buy her one. They didn’t get her one and she was pretty upset. I should note that I’m not very close with my cousin. Or the rest of my extended family for that matter. I only heard about this through the grapevine from my dad. AnywayMy cousin texts me on the Friday before her birthday asking if she can take my car (I just leased a new Ford escape) to the mall and then for an out of town road trip with her friends over the weekend. I tell her no. She begs and pleads with me. I tell her no again. My car is for me to drive and for me only. If she wants her own car she can save up and buy one. She calls me a bitch and says that I ruined her birthday and that she’s embarrassed because her friends think she got a car for her birthday and she doesn’t have one. I don’t respond to her and think nothing of it. The weekend comes and I sleep in very late on that Saturday, waking up at 1:00 pm (don’t judge lol). Even though my car is parked in my driveway and my gate is closed, I come to realize that someone egged and TP’d my car. With many, many eggs and 5-6 rolls of TP. And since the weather was warm outside, the raw egg baked into my car, along with the dried up toilet paper, destroying the paint. Since I have security cameras around my house, I decide to go back and watch. At around nine thirtyish that morning, I see my cousin and a bunch of her stupid friends vandalizing my car. I’m surprise she didn’t smash the windows and poke holes in the tires too.To save my post from the 3000 character limit, I obviously pressed charges and my cousin is in legal trouble. Her and her parents are pissed off at me for pressing charges, her parents telling me that she’s “just a kid” and that she’s been through a lot of ‘emotional stress’ doing virtual schooling for this past year and that I should take that into consideration, and that I should be ashamed of myself for pressing legal charges against my baby cousin, that I’m almost 30 and dont I remember what I was like at that age? (I do remember, and I wasn’t stupid enough to egg anyone’s car) and can’t she work something out with me like doing chores around my house for money if I drop the charges... that she’s young, that she doesn’t need a felony on her record, etc. and that it was just a prank. Right after I press charges, my cousin was calling and texting me over and over saying that this could’ve been avoided had I let her take my car. Am I the asshole in this situation?I need to add that my cousin already has a felony on her record, a DUI. She’s not remorseful of anything.Also, my aunt and uncle will not pay me for the damages. They just want me to drop the charges and pay for everything myself like nothing happened. They are cheap."
229,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my grandma she looks like Ronald McDonald because she wouldn’t stop telling me I look like a bull with my nose ring in?,26008,cre4qy,2415,"Edit: getting a lot of comments about this so thought I’d make an edit. My piercing is NOT a septum which makes the weird insult even more stupid. Septum piercings are usually tagged as “looking like a bull” (I don’t agree with that) but I have my hoop in my nostril.Here’s how it happened. Every time I see my grandma, she tells me something to the effect of “take that thing out of your nose, you’re ruining a pretty face by putting a hoop in it like a bull.” The last time she said it to me I politely asked her to leave it alone or next time I wouldn’t be so polite. To be fair this is the first time I spoke up because I’m not confrontational but the older I get the more I stand up for myself. And for that matter, I shouldn’t even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. Fast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. I immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like Ronald McDonald. A lot of people are pretty pissed off at me but A) I warned her and asked her to stop and B) she’s insulting my appearance so why is what I said any worse than what she has said to me a million times? I’m usually all about respect and politeness but my nose ring (in my nostril not my septum by the way so the bull comment doesn’t even make sense) does not “ruin” my face and even if it does it’s really not her place. I’m a grown ass woman and I refuse to be bullied by any even older grown ass woman. So, was I the asshole?"
230,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my mom I'm not making her choose because I'm happy to be left out,25993,jsdt8d,1937,"I'm (26f) recently divorced after learning my sister (27f) and husband were having an affair. I cut my sister off the day I found out. We have not spoken since, we have not been in the same room for more than ten seconds and I will not have a relationship with her moving forward. This year has been rough and Covid made some things easier regarding there was no visiting family so the pressure was gone. But recently my mom wanted to have a family dinner again and I told her I would not go because I did not want to be in my sisters presence. She told me I can't avoid her forever, she's my sister and we share family. I told her I can and I will. Her response was telling me I am being unfair making her choose between us and I said I'm not making her choose because I'm fine not being invited, I know my stance means I will end up being excluded. But I will not play nice with her and my ex. Especially now that they are getting married too. We're never going to play happy families. I don't want to be civil to them. So I would rather not have anything to do with them. And they will never have anything to do with me again.My mom thinks I'm being very unfair.AITA?Edited to add since this was asked: My dad died 9 years ago."
231,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my sister see her kids?,25983,g6zfpa,1578,"I (28f) obtained custody of my sister's (35f) kids (9m,4f,2f), back in 2018, after she left them alone for two weeks to go on a ""trip"" (read. drug bender). Of course this was a huge transition for the kiddos, they had to be moved schools and daycares, and of course couldn't see their mom anymore. Now, the kids are doing better and definitely lead happier lives. Recently, though, my sister was released from prison, and wants to see the kids again. She called me, begging to have a visit with them, and telling me that I could give them back because she was out of prison now. I've had a talk with the 9 year old, and he says that he doesn't want to see his mom yet, and that he still hates her for leaving him alone. The girls have no memories of her, and the smallest one was only three months old the last time she saw her.I do feel like I could have helped them foster a better relationship with her, but I don't want to force the oldest into meeting her when he absolutely doesn't want to.Still, my close family has told me that the oldest doesn't know what he's talking about, and it's my fault the little ones don't remember their mother because I didn't take them to see her when she was in prison. They also told me that it's my responsibility to force them to meet her, even when they don't want to, because that's what's best for them and they shouldn't grow up without their mother.So, AITA?Edit- I have spoken to a professional about this, specifically the oldest's therapist. They have advised that it should be up to him. I just want to know if I'm being a jerk to my sister. Also, I have adopted the kids, and have full custody of them."
232,Not the A-hole,AITA for cancelling on a group of very out of shape women that hired me to train/guide their hikes?,25926,canwj2,712,"First up please know I am trying my best to be kind in my wording. I run a small operation where I guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. I have served all kinds of clients.I got an inquiry for a group called ""Womens+ Adventures"" and because it was during Pride Month, I thought maybe it was an LGBTQ+ group. I chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and I started the training plan.The group wanted to work up to ""A 14er"" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. Going off what everyone reported, I decided Gray's Peak. One of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.When I arrived for our first group hike, I learned ""Womens+"" meant plus-sized women rather than LGBTQ+. No issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  The first hike was... awful. It was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. Several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. When we got started hiking, it was very slow. One woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. One ate all of her snacks after the first break. Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. After we got back (6 hours later) I pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. She insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that I didn't believe them. When I suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. I gave them all ""homework"" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. Several of them laughed at me incredulously.2nd Hike went even worse. I had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. So I called the head and told her that I thought it was best if I refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. Well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that I am fatphobic, I'm mocking them, etc.Please, PLEASE keep in mind that I have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. I consider myself to be VERY patient. One of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. Simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. I refunded the money and ended contact only to find my Social Media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. You can guess what I was called. I felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me I was an asshole for not powering through, that I should have given them THREE chances, that I should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.AITA?"
233,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling the cops when my bf's sister left her children with me for a few days which ended with her getting a felony charge?,25912,ijffjm,2987,"I am pretty sure I am the AH and I did not think something this bad would happen. This happened about a year ago. Me and my BF have been together for 5 years. His sister, Claire, has a 1 year old baby, Alex. Claire is a single mom and sometimes drops her baby off at our place when she has some errands to run. I will be honest here. I have no clue how to take care of a baby. I play with the baby but other than that my BF usually takes care of Alex. My BF work is onsite. So he usually isn't home for 4 days and then comes home for 3 days. One day, Claire asked my BF if she can drop off Alex for the day. BF was supposed to leave for work that evening. Since she had said that she will pick up the baby by evening, he didn't mention that. Big mistake. He left around 5 pm. I was waiting for Claire and kept calling her. She picked up the phone around 8 pm and told me that she went to a place few hours away with her friends. She told me to tell BF to take care of Alex for next 3-4 days. I told her that BF already left for work. Then she just told me ""Then you take care of Alex. I will back in 4 days."" And then she hung up on me and switched off her phone. I freaked out hard. I cannot call BF because he is unreachable onsite. Neither of us have family in the state that we could have called. I called few friends but no one gave me anything helpful. The bag she gave with Alex only had diapers left in it. The baby was crying her head off and I didn't even know what to feed her safely. I literally didn't know how else to do. So, I called the police and told them what happened. They directed me to a social worker. While the social worker was helping me take care of the baby, the cops called the cops where she was to locate her. The cops found her high marijuana and she had enough on her for them to classify it as possesion and intention to sell (Edit: I don't think she actually sold anything. She probably just brought enough for her and her friends for the next few days). She didn't get any jail time. She had to do community service and plead guilty. Unfortunately, that also meant she got a felony conviction. This got her fired and she hasn't been able to hold on to a good job since. In my defense, I only wanted her to come back because I didn't want anything to happen to Alex because I am not capable of taking care of her. I did not think she was doing anything that would get her arrested. In her defense, she has left Alex at our home plenty of times, so it's not unreasonable for her to think that I would have no problem taking care of Alex for a few days. Also, this was probably the first time she took a break for herself since Alex was born. My boyfriend was pissed in the beginning but came around later. Their parents also think I wasn't in the wrong. She obviously hates me and thinks I ruined her life because she wanted a break for a few days. This got brought up recently at a family dinner which is why I ask. AITA?"

When my daughter turned 4 months old, he married his current wife. I met my husband when my daughter was 2 years old and married him when she turned 3. My daughter is now 7 years old and I have a 3 year old son with my husband. My ex has two daughters with his wife, who are 6 and 4. My ex has an every other weekend visitation with our daughter. Now my daughter used to call my husband 'popi' , but ever since the birth of my son, my daughter has started calling my husband 'daddy'. That's what I call my husband when I address him in front of my son, and my daughter has kind of picked up on that. We never told her no, because my husband loves my daughter and thinks of her as his own. He has stayed up nights taking care of her the times she has been sick.Now, she doesn't have the same relationship with her stepmother. She has always called her stepmother by her actual first name, and it has always been that way, even though her stepmother has known her for a longer time than my husband. Here's why I'm wondering if I'm the asshole. The other night, when me and my husband went to pick up my daughter from her dad's, my daughter ran out of their door happily saying ""mommy and daddy are here, I'm going home!""When my ex heard her address my husband as 'daddy', he turned visibly upset. Later when we got home, my ex blew up on my phone saying that I was emotionally abusing my daughter by 'making' her call another man ""daddy"" and that I needed to make her stop. I said that our daughter has all the right to call my husband daddy if it makes her happy. He then asked me how I'd feel if he made our daughter call his wife ""mommy"". I told him that if my daughter hasn't called her "" Mommy "" after 6 years of knowing her, it is because she never wanted to. I said that it isn't my fault if our daughter feels closer to her stepfather and actually loves our family together. After saying that, I hanged up. The next day my ex mother in law called me accusing me of parental alienation. This is honestly messing with my mind. My husband loves my daughter. Is it really bad if we let her call him ""daddy""?. He loves it and in fact, he always says that he has 2 kids."
235,Not the A-hole,AITA for changing the package pickup each time someone uses my email for orders?,25828,heoy9x,1466,"So pretty much, there’s this guy who keeps ordering things with my email. He isn’t using any other personal information of mine so i don’t think it’s a privacy concern. So back to the point, I will occasionally get emails from random websites about an order confirmation. I’ve never heard of most of those websites and I know for a fact none of my family members used my email to buy something.With most emails, there’s a number, name and an address (I’m assuming it’s the persons address) attached. I’ve tried texting the number and even calling but I’ve never gotten an answer. I’d always get emails from ups to confirm the pickup/drop off area. Ever since I’ve gotten the emails, I always change the location for delivery. So instead of it being delivered at his doorstep, it gets shipped to a post office 20 miles away. He can’t change that since like I said, it’s all attached to my email.I recently got an email from the guy and turns out, the reason he keeps writing my email is because his and mine are both almost identical. (Imagine mine is “abc” his is “acb”) so he always switches one letter therefore I get the emails. In his email, he calls me an asshole for making the pickup so far. When I asked him why can’t he just use his own email he said: It’s always a typo I do and I don’t feel like fixing it because it takes too much time.I’m not even joking, that’s exactly what he said.So AITA for sabotaging this guys packages?"
236,Not the A-hole,AITA for exposing the real reason my sister and her bf broke up.,25760,byiwjh,2263,"throwaway, and I will be keeping this is Anonymous as I can, every name will be fake. my sister (cas) 25f and her boyfriend (jon) of 3 years 24m broke up last week, I'm good friends with jon and we chat in a discord server often. I assumed it was a mutual breakup and so asked Jon if he was doing ok, he then asked me if I knew the reason they broke up. I said no and he explained that it was because he was bisexual, he even showed me screenshots where it showed how homophobic my sister is, I was shocked and apologized to him. the next day I was scrolling through Facebook and noticed my sister had made a post about the breakup, turns out she is claiming that he cheated on her. she must of blocked him so he could not show the actual truth. with Jon's permission I posted all the screenshots on my Facebook page.  it caused my parents to call me and tell me I have to take the post down as my sister has had over 30 people unfriend her, I've also had messages from my sister that where not so nice. my mum has told me that I'm now ruining my sisters life. AITA?edit 1 I've seen no proof of my sisters claims besides her word. and from what the screenshots showed she absolutely hated the fact that he was bi and wanted nothing to do with him."
237,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my boyfriend's co-worker that we're not married?,25759,la3xpq,3843,"I've been with Boyfriend for about 5 years. We live together. He does not want to get married, which I'm fine with now, but it was a point of contention early on in our relationship.Boyfriend was talking to Co-worker on zoom when I brought him some coffee. Co-worker said something like ""so this is the lovely wife I've heard so much about"". I said something like ""thanks but we're not married"". He said ""oh, Boyfriend always calls you his wife"", and then introduced himself, I introduced myself, then ended the conversation and left as quickly I could while still being polite because both Boyfriend and Co-worker were giving me a weird vibe.A little while later, Boyfriend came out of the office and asked ""what was that?"". I didn't know what he meant so I asked ""what was what?"". Boyfriend then said that there was absolutely no need for me to correct Co-worker and that it's better if people think I'm his wife. I said I'm not his wife, I'm his girlfriend, and he never told me that he told other people that I'm his wife.This somehow becomes an argument, with my side being that Boyfriend never told me that his co-workers think we're married, and Boyfriend's side being that I should have figured that being called his wife indicated that Co-worker thought I was his wife and I shouldn't have corrected him, and when I said I thought he'd just made an assumption, Boyfriend said that wasn't the point, the point was that there was no need to correct him, that it was rude, and that it make Boyfriend look like a dickhead.He then said that the solution to this is that when he next has a video call with Co-worker, he wants me to come in again, strike up a conversation, and say that I was messing with him, and that Boyfriend is actually Husband and us not being married is an inside joke I thought Co-worker was in on.I then said that was the dumbest fucking plan he'd ever come up with, and ""no fucking way am I doing that"", and he said I was being an arsehole, that I got him into this, and now I have to bail him out.AITA?&#x200B;Update: We talked. He's fucking a (female) co-worker. Apparently ""I can't leave my wife for you"" sounds better than ""I can't leave my girlfriend for you"". So now he's going to have to tell people we've divorced."
238,Not the A-hole,"AITA for asking for pocket money because ""I am a kid too""",25748,d2mewl,2103,"I am 19F, have a little brother who is 8, and living with my parents at the moment. I am still studying so I cannot pay rent yet, but I do earn my own pocket money from part-time jobs.My father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. They have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. That plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. I had been arranged to join the kids' group, when I tried to protest they insist that I am a ""kid"" too, so I just had to submit to my fate. Clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they ""adults"" get out and enjoy their reunion.So I spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. That includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to Science Park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an ""adult"" when needed. To be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when I sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(I admit, I am not really babysitter material). The kids seem to like me, so I guess it went well too. However, I still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. When my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. Almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. Now, I don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes I can easily earn in a few hours, but I am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, I was skipped for being an ""adult"" this time.I put on the biggest smile I and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. They were a little taken aback. I said as sweetly as I could that I deserve pocket money too for being a ""kid"", they said so themselves. In all awkwardness I got my pocket money. Needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.I got the biggest shit from my parents after they left. In their words, I am a major AH to have deliberately made my parents lose face, and so on and so forth. AITA?"
239,Not the A-hole,AITA for turning off the wifi when my husband camps in the bathroom for extended lengths of time.,25753,elpvjj,4540,"My husband and I are the parents of twins who are less than a year old. Anytime my husband SHOULD be doing something with the children ( it's his turn for a diaper, a bottle, even just soothing a fussy newborn) he ALWAYS goes to the bathroom first. We are both on maternity / paternity leave currently.My husband is on medication that makes him spend a lot of time in the bathroom about an hour after a meal. It's a medication he has been on and off several times over the past year. He is never on it for more than a few weeks, and it does not effect him all the time, but he always claims that is why he is in the bathroom. ( I did ask, the doctor didnt say it was impossible, but highly unlikely. Doc wanted him to come in for a checkup if this was the case and husband said oh it's not THAT bad and refuses to go in )I would rather let him use the restroom first than have to put down a baby mid task, but over the past couple months he has been spending more and more time in there. He always takes his phone. He is always watching youtube. His average session is 25 minutes in there, often longer, rarely shorter.It's the most frustrating when it comes time to feed them ( one of the twins needs to be held specifically for health reasons, so I can not double feed ) because we will get up, I will warm up bottles, change one baby bum, get the first one fed, burped, and laid down in their crib, get the other baby changed and be setteling down to feed baby number two before he can be bothered to emerge and figure out why one child has been screaming because they had to watch their sibling eat l, and then the other when cry when they dont get to cuddle at all because I have to immediately set them down to feed the hysterically sobbing child. Yesterday was a week and a half sence I started truly keeping track, and he, only twice in 10 days, not ditched me to go camp out in the bathroom and let me finish %80 of the childcare.Today I started a new rule. If he is in the bathroom for more than 10 minutes, I flip the wifi off. He has not spend more than 15 minutes in the bathroom at a stretch today, but is extremely upset. I feel like the fact that without the wifi his uncontrollable toilet issue cleared up rather quickly proves why it needs to be done, but he feels I am being unreasonable, and I need to make sure sleep deprivation isnt makeing me an asshole.TLDR: AITA for turning off the wifi when my husband is in the bathroom for extended periods of time, avoiding domestic and fatherly duties.Edit: to answer questions that people have been asking.Yes, I have talked to him about this. 10 days ago we had a conversation about the situation, and he denied how long hes been spending in the bathroom. This conversation is also the one where I proposed he see a doctor.Yes he has down time. He spends a good deal of time working on his car and plahs diablo about 8 hours straight every day. He spends most of his time on the other side of the house on his PC in his office."

241,Not the A-hole,"AITA for rejecting the role of ""cool aunt"" because it was really more like unpaid babysitter?",25723,i62p53,2369,"My sister and I have always been very different. Growing up, she was your stereotypical nerdy/geeky girl. Very into sci-fi/fantasy, video games, etc. She bonded a lot with my parents over it, because they are the same.I always felt kind of ""different"" from the others because I'm not very ""geeky"" and while I did my best to fit in (Star Wars movies, Harry Potter, etc), I took my first opportunity to leave the area for school. I went to FIT and got a degree in fashion design.  I always loved making my own clothes. To frame it one way... I made my prom dress from my own pattern, and my family smiled politely. My sister threw together a Harry Potter costume and the picture is hanging on the walls.Well, sis had kids a while back. I sent polite gifts, including a quilt to be handed down. Sis received them warmly, but I found out she doesn't use the quilt because the room is ""Harry Potter"" themed.Due to COVID, I ended up moving back closer to home into a condo I'd been renting out (tenants were not evicted or anything). Once Sis found out, she got really excited and started making all kinds of plans. I was thrilled because I thought *she* wanted to spend more time with me.Except the plans were like... I take the kids to the zoo, I take them to the park, I take them for ice cream, the aquarium, etc, so Sis can have some time to herself and relax, play video games, etc. I inquired about when she and I would spend time together, and she actually said ""It's not like we have anything in common we can do together.""I was really hurt by this, and declined her requests for me to basically babysit her kids. She asked me why, and didn't I want to be the Cool Aunt, and this is where I think I'm the asshole.I said ""I don't know, it's not like I have anything in common with them that we can do together. Sounds like you want an unpaid babysitter.""She was shocked and went stomping to Mom and Dad, who immediately took her side and told me that I should be thankful to spend time with the kids. I said why, it's not like anyone in the family has *ever* made it a point to spend time with me doing something *I'd* enjoy. She told me that if I'd tried harder to be more like there rest of them, instead of ""chasing popularity and doing my nails"" maybe I would have more in common with them.I'm lost now, because on the one hand, I don't think I was wrong to decline being a free sitter for my sister. But maybe my Mom is right and I've been a shitty member of the family because I couldn't just get into Star Wars and all that.**EDIT:** I just wanted to chime in and say that Star Wars & Harry Potter aren't the only geeky/nerdy things they like, they were just the things that popped into my head. I remember back when we were in high school, my sister laughed in my face because I didn't enjoy the Sabriel books and she told me they were ""too advanced"" for me to understand. She found me reading the California Diaries (offshoot of Babysitters Club books) and laughed in my face again because they were ""dumb books for vapid little girls.""**EDIT 2:** One thing I'm curious about is why so many people are telling me, first thing, in their comments, that they're geeky/nerdy! Why do you think that makes things different? "

Approximately five nights of the week, he'll play games online from the time that our son goes to bed at 8:00 or 8:30 to about 12:30, so at least four continuous hours. That in itself is not at all an issue for our relationship. He spends plenty of time with me and our son, and I have my own hobbies that he isn't interested in that I engage in when he's online.A few nights ago I was doing laundry while he was playing online, and I stepped on a toy that my son had left on the basement stairs. I fell pretty hard and dropped the basket. Luckily because of the way my weight was shifted I fell backwards rather than forwards, resulting in a bruise on my butt but I was otherwise fine. The laundry basket clattered down the stairs, ricocheted off some basement furniture, shot laundry everywhere. It was a huge racket. It woke up my son. My husband, who had his headphones on, heard literally nothing.It dawned on me that if something really bad happened to me, my husband wouldn't know about it for potentially four hours - like what if I broke my leg falling down the stairs? So I asked if he would be willing, for my peace of mind, to just pop out of his office at the mid-point each night just to check on me. Like literally, just say hi and go back to gaming. He thinks this is a huge overreaction and a waste of time. I know for a fact that he isn't actively playing the entire time and he sometimes takes breaks to go to the bathroom or get a snack or whatever, so how is this different? AITA?"

Lately, she's been talking about how  such a tiny living space is not enough for the four of them.&#x200B; When she got to know about the house I had bought, she became very upset and told me I was being ""wasteful"" as I'm single and don't have kids and  therefor don't need such a big space. I reminded her that what I do with my hard earned money is none  of her business. She went on to complain to our mother about how ""selfish"" I was being. Yesterday evening, I got a call from my mom telling me I should let my sister and her kids move into the house. MY house.&#x200B;I told her that no one was going to live in the house that I paid for but me, and that extra space would be great for my dogs to play in. My mom also got very upset with me and told me I was being unreasonable.  That my sister's kids are growing and need the space more than my dogs.  I offered to help my sister out financially  so she could rent a bigger place. My mom got my sister on the phone who shot down the idea, telling me I *needed* to let her and her kids live in my house. When I refused again, she very generously suggested a ""compromise"". I could live in the house with her and her kids and would not have to find somewhere else to live. She said this as if she was doing me a favor. &#x200B;I told her she had lost her mind and hung up.

He is has a group of friends in the neighborhood that he always hangs out with, they all enjoy skating and longboarding and stuff so that's what they're doing most of the time. The boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their parents are hella weird. They have a groupchat where they're secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. My mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it's honestly ridiculous they'll sent texts like ""I saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago"" ""They were in our garden 5 minutes ago I think now they're headed to the skate park"". I think it's hilarious because our neighborhood isn't dangerous at all.One of the moms in the chat is especially annoying because she keeps calling our house and asking if her son 'Jake' is there. We once were put in a groupchat together for a church project and since then she has my number and texts me all the time asking about the boys, because my mom won't respond. Now yesterday I was home alone at about 2pm because my mom was at work and my siblings were out. Jakes mom had called my phone two times but I didn't answer cause she was annoying me. My boyfriend came over and we were just sorta chilling in the living room talking and listening to music. We were sitting on the couch and started to kiss and make out a bit. It was all nice and peaceful and suddenly I hear a really loud knock. It really made us jump because it was just so sudden. I turn to look and there's Jakes freakin mom outside, knocking at the window. I nearly hit the ceiling I was so angry. I go outside and she's all like blah blah sorry to interrupt I just wanted to ask because I haven't seen Jake in almost two hours ect.ect. Apparently we didn't hear the doorbell because of the music so she just walked around the house to investigate and look in the windows. I really blew up at her saying that she's a weirdo who stalks her son everywhere and a freak to look in other peoples windows. I also asked her if her obsessive stalking was the reason for her divorce which probably went a little to far.My boyfriend thought I was justified and my brother thought it was funny but my mom is mad at me because all the other parents are now blowing up her phone. She also thinks I shouldn't have said that stuff about the divorce.  I feel sorry for putting my mom in this position but I feel like someone needed to tell that lady how annoying her behavior is."
246,Not the A-hole,AITA For walking out of my father's funeral?,25478,gs4smm,993,"Thowaway account for obvious reasons.Important info:- I'm a caucasian F, early 30's. Married to a lovely mixed M and we have a 2yr old.- I've cut contact with my family about 5yrs ago, mostly due to my mother's narcissistic behaviour and her being pretty darn racist (she hated me dating my now husband), and the rest of my family condoning the crap she put us up with. - Most of my other relatives cut ties withwith my family before I was born or shortly after, I'm thinking it's once again because of my mother. The only one that kept in touch was one aunt, from my father's side.This happened yesterday.Last friday I got a call from my aunt that my dad got into an accident 2 days prior and didn't make it (he died on impact apparently). She asked me if I'd heard anything from my family, to which I replied 'no' (important to know that I've been using the same cellphone number and email since I was 18 or so). She figured they forgot and asked me if I wanted to come to the funeral. After a few minutes of thinking I told her I'd come if my family was okay with it and if SHE wanted me to, I explained to her that I wouldn't be going for myself or my father/family, just to support her. She said she'd want me there as she'd have no other support and called me later to tell me my family was okay with me coming.So, yesterday was the day of the funeral. The past few days I did not hear a single thing from my family. When I got to the location my family members jumped right on top of me, telling me how happy they were that I came/that we should go to dinner/told me all kinds of stories about thing that happened the last 5yrs........they basically acted like those 5yrs didn't happed and we weren't there for a funeral. I know grieve does things to people, so I let it slide and played along, but it made me feel really uneasy and I made sure not to give any details about my own family or job, as they know nothing about that and I wanted to keep it that way as it was not the time and place for an argument about my husband.During the ceremony they insisted I sat next to my mother. Everything started out okay, but when it was time for speeches, my family insisted I'd speak. I quietly told them no, that I had nothing prepared, but they didn't accept it. So I got up and quickly said 'he'll be missed' and sat down again. They visibly were not happy with me and my mother started shouting at me, telling me I was a worthless bitch, that I'd always treated them without any respect and that I was a bicth for not giving an actual speech about how amazing my father was in front of the +150 people that had shown up.So, I looked at her for a few seconds, mostly trying to figure out wth just happened..........stood up, told her to enjoy the rest of her day and walked out.My husband told me I did the right thing and he was proud of me for keeping my cool instead of starting a shouting match, so is my aunt........but I've been bombarded with messages from people that say I went too far.

247,Not the A-hole,AITA for propositioning a girl in the gym?,25466,bgyfr0,1705,"Please hear me out before you judge because while I did say what you’re thinking I didn’t say it in the way you’re thinking.The gym I go to is very small. Not a lot of machines and not a lot of patrons. This means working out fairly close to people even if you don’t mean to. Yesterday I (23 f if it makes a difference) was on the extended leg press doing my thing when a girl and her boyfriend began working out on the machine beside me. (One would do a set while the other waited beside them) The girl looked at me, rolled her eyes and muttered to her boyfriend “Ugh I hate girls who only come to the gym to get a big ass.”I shrugged her off, and kept doing my thing. I was on the assisted pull up machine doing an exercise where you put one foot on the pad and push downwards (apologies for not knowing the name, my trainer showed me it so I’m not entirely sure if it’s an actual well known exercise) The same girl looks at me, tuts and says to her bf “Look there she goes again, and her forms terrible.” Which is possibly true but she pissed me off.At this point I call her out. I said “Oi, you.” She immediately looked like she shit herself and ignored me. So I called her out again specifically “You in the purple top.” She turned round and asked what I wanted. The following conversation happens:Me; Do you want to fuck me?Her: What?!Me: I said do you want to fuck me?Her: What the fuck is wrong with you?Me: Well you keep staring at me, so I’m assuming you either want to fuck me or fight me, so which is it?She went bright red, grabbed her boyfriends arm and went to the changing rooms. I carried on with my workout and didn’t see them again.When I told my friend what happened, he said I acted like a dick and that as a woman I should know how much it sucks to be objectified in the gym. He also pointed out that I embarrassed her in front of everyone and ruined her and her bfs work out. My defence is she should also know how much it sucks to make people make disparaging comments about you in the gym and that she shouldn’t talk shit if she doesn’t want called out on it.I’ll admit that I’m a pretty confrontational person and I could have reacted better but I also think she should mind her own business."
248,Not the A-hole,AITA for forcing a confession out of my wife about spying on my kids therapy sessions,25404,gy8z0s,1808,"So for those that don’t know, I have two children M20 and F19 and ever since the world went to hell, I got them therapy sessions at their requests because they said that this was taking a huge toll on them.On Wednesday when my daughter went to attend the zoom session my wife had left to go take a nap. I didn't think much of it, but she came back exactly 3 hours later after both of them finished looking sad. Today the same thing happened and when I went to wake her up for dinner today I found her watching a recording of my daughter’s session. I lost it. That conversation was supposed I will be private we had promised our kids that we will respect their privacy and do our best to help them when they need it.I made her confess to our kids and told her. They were heartbroken and they hate her. She claims that it’s my fault but she dug her own grave. Both of them feel betrayed and don't want anything to do with their mother. So Reddit am I the asshole for forcing a confession??Edit: Thank you for the Platinum award strangerEdit2: Thank you for the Silver award strangerI really do appreciate both of themEdit3: Thank you guys for the overwhelming support. I really do love this subreddit.Edit4: Thank you for the gold kind strangerEdit5: For the people wondering about her intention for spying on the kids. She hasn’t said a word about it. Just got up and left saying that “I don’t need to take this shit”Minor update:Hey so many of you wanted an update, but it’s too soon to tell what will actually happen.As of now my soon to be ex-wife is staying at a friends house. I did receive some calls from her and her friends about how I’m an asshole but after I explained everything to her friends they apologised and sided with me.My kids do want a divorce but I feel as tho she has already put that plan into motion. I’m not too worry as I am able to afford better lawyers than her. My kids are actually grateful that I did what I did because they now realised that their mom is a control freak. Funny enough a friend had found the post after a mutual friend told them and showed it to my wife.Sorry if this is short, but this is all I have as of right now."
249,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my husband he is either married to me or his co-worker?,25388,jki2fy,2220,"My (37f) husband (40m) has been working at his company for 10 years as a maintenance supervisor. About a year ago they hired Tabitha\* to work in their accounting department. Since the day she first started working there, she has had an infatuation with my husband that is now becoming unprofessional and inappropriate.This started when the heat went out in her office. My husband's job as supervisor is to assign tasks to his employees, however, she is never satisfied with the work they do, even though he says that they do great work, so she demands he work on her office. She constantly calls him on his work phone for mundane things (carpet is loose in a corner, loose screw on her coat hook) and he goes and fixes them without issue. Last year when we went to the company Christmas party (pre-plague times) she was very flirty with him, constantly grabbed his hand. When he introduced us she just grinned at my and said ""look there's Peter,"" and grabbed his hand and walked away. When we sat at the table she damn near pushed me out of my seat to sit next to him, and my husband told her to get up that it was my seat. She walked off in a huff, and when she saw me in the restroom she shoved past me. I told my husband what happened and he said it was fine, that she was harmless. I told him that she was not fine, and that she clearly had feelings for him and she was acting like a jealous girlfriend. The past few weeks this has ramped up to an astonishing level of inappropriate. She recently moved into a new house and my husband and some of the other guys from work helped her move and put things together. He gave her his personal cell phone number, and she has been calling and texting non-stop about things she needs help with. Multiple times a day at all hours of the day and night she will call and text him for help. Last night at 2:00AM she called about her heat not working right. My husband said he would go over and look at it after work. I broke down. I told him he was not going, that she could call a technician like everyone else, and that he is not her personal maintenance man. I told him very clearly that she has feelings for him and he is so dense he can't see it. I told him that while it is nice to help on occasion, she calls him all the time asking for help with things that she can do on her own (move boxes/furniture) or pay to have a repair person come and fix. I told him that once he gave out his personal phone number that he crossed a line, and I am not comfortable with it. He said that this will most likely be an easy fix and it won't take long, so I cried and told him that he can either to be married to me, or married to her, but I wasn't going to be the third wheel in my own marriage. He says he does not have feelings for her and that I am overreacting to him just wanting to help a friend. I feel otherwise.AITA?"
250,Not the A-hole,AITA for being upset and leaving when my sister in law stole my pregnancy announcement?,25327,ivrh66,2800,"[UPDATE ONE]( [UPDATE TWO]( I (36f) found out that I am pregnant. I am overjoyed as I have always wanted a child of my own. I focused on my career in my life and since I am single, I wasn’t sure if having a baby would ever happen.I was excited to tell my family the big news. My older sister has one child, my nephew (7m). My brother is married but he and his wife have made it very clear they will always be child free.Last night we had a family dinner and I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to share the news. Since this will be my only child I wanted to make it special and I also wanted to involve my nephew.I got a shirt that read “this is what an awesome big cousin looks like”. I slipped away with my nephew before dinner and had a special moment with him while I told him he was going to have a cousin. My nephew was very excited and put on the shirt. He put his sweater on over it and I told him he could take the sweater off whenever he wanted at dinner.In the middle of dinner he took off the sweater and waited for someone to notice. Soon my sister jumped up and excitedly screamed when she saw the shirt.They all then immediately assumed it was my sister in law. I wasn’t hurt my them assuming this and I kind of expected it because she is married.I was hurt because my sister in law didn’t try to correct them. She just went along with it and began to rub her flat belly while laughing. I must have looked completely hurt because my mother yelled at me to stop being rude and to congratulate them.I tried to explain that I was the one who gave my nephew the shirt. They all didn’t even hear me and just continued to fawn over my sister in law. My brother stood frozen in shock just asking his wife if she was serious.I got up and went home. I received multiple texts at this point from them telling me what an asshole I am for making this about me. They said things like it wasn’t my sister in laws fault that I was jealous. I didn’t reply to anything and just cried myself to sleep.This morning my sister in law must have finally let it slip that she is not pregnant. They have now all called me to apologize saying that they just got caught up in the moment.They said I shouldn’t have left the dinner and that it’s my fault I wasn’t clear enough that I was the one who is pregnant. My mom said I could have a redo dinner so I can get it right and they will all act surprised. My sister in law sent me a message that said that the way I chose to announce was how she wanted to do it if she ever got pregnant. She said that since she is not ever having a child that she just wanted to experience what the moment would be like. She also said I can have my chance at the redo dinner. I told them no and that I will not be doing a redo. Every single person has now told me I am being selfish and an asshole because I won’t let them make it right.To me there’s no fixing this. I will eventually forgive them but I don’t want to do a second announcement so they feel better.AITA?"
251,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my new neighbours that I've been trapped in a basement for a week after she told me not to check my mail box on weekends?,25309,dh6wvr,1477,"I've been away since Thursday, house sitting for my mum, and it's currently Sunday afternoon where I live.  Here, mail doesn't deliver on weekends, they only do that Monday to Friday, which means I had 2 days worth of mail in my mailbox. My 30 something year old neighbours moved in on Friday when I wasn't here, and she was in her front yard when I was collecting my mail. She goes ""Don't check your mailbox on weekends. They don't deliver on weekends. So don't check it."" (In a rude Karen voice, if you know then you know.) Already, I know we're not going to have a good neighbour relationship, and I'm hungover and can't be bothered dealing with her shit, so I said ""I know, it's just I've been kidnapped in the basement for a week so I had to check the mailbox."" I don't have a basement, barely anyone does in my country. She seemed shocked, but it was an obvious joke with my overly sarcastic tone. Then we both went inside and that was that. About 25 minutes later, the police knocked on the door thinking I was held captive in my basement which I don't have, so I explained to them what I had said and they just laughed and left.Just before, I was putting rubbish in the bin and she came out and called me a c*nt for making her think I was kidnappedAITA?Edit: spellingEdit 2: Thanks for your judgement everyone. I honestly thought it was going to have a different outcome because I felt horrible after the police arrived, like what I said was incredibly wrong of me (which it is, don’t do what I did). But I’m disabling reply notificationsAlso, I am Australian"
252,Not the A-hole,AITA for showing my boyfriend my used sanitary towel in an argument?,25287,fbv7ty,3682,"Title sounds gross I know, maybe it is a bit gross.Background: me (F23) and boyfriend (m22) have been together for 6 months, good relationship, healthy sex life that we talk about a lot and communicate our needs etc. A month ago I had the implant fitted (contreception) which has given me weird frequent periods. The doctor told me they should go back to normal in a few months and to wait it out, which I'm doing because I like the convenience of the implant. English isn't my first language so sorry for any bad writing.We were in bed yesterday night watching TV and he went to initiate sex. I moved his hand away and said I was still on my period. My period had been going for about a week now so we'd not had sex in that time. Then my boyfriend made a really loud dramatic sigh and moved away from me. I said 'sorry, I can't help my periods.'He replied 'yeah sure.' I said what was that suppose to mean? He wouldn't give me a straight answer and kept saying 'whatever'.We didn't talk for a while and kept watching TV in silence. Then he said 'if you don't want to have sex you can just say you know.'I was kind of pissed off at this because I felt like he was saying I was faking being on my period. I told him I really was still on my period. He said no periods last longer than a week, and I told him that the doctor had said this was normal for some people on the implant at first and it will settle.He told me that he didn't believe me and so I called him an idiot (which wasn't nice I know). He then started ranting that how could I call him an idiot when I was clearly a liar who must be cheating on him and getting sex elsewhere which is why I am lying about my periods. I couldn't believe he was saying this because he's never freaked out on me like this. Cheating has also never ever been mentioned in our relationship ever so I don't know where this came from. It annoyed me so much that I got out of bed and pulled my trousers and pants down so he could see my sanitary towel that was bloody and shouted Could I fake this??He screamed that I was fucking disgusting and left the room. I started laughing because of the ridiculous of the situation and that pissed him off more, as he grabbed his keys and stormed out of the house.I tried to text him but he ignored me, so I left him to it as I was pretty annoyed by his behaviour. I then got a text a few hours later around 11pm from his sister saying he had gone to his mom and dad's house and told his sister what happened. She said what I had done was really disgusting and he's refusing to come back unless I apologise. I told my friend what happened and she said he was being an idiot but that I also needed to apologise because what I did was 'abhorrent'.I'm annoyed with what he did but also think it was pretty gross of me to do that. I don't really know why I did it it was just a spur of the moment thing. So AITA?&#x200B;Edit: Just wanted to offer an update. This has really changed my perspective on things. I think I was so thinking about the sanitary towel thing that I hadn't really realised how bad his behaviour was. His mom actually sent me a message on facebook saying what I did was disgusting and really abnormal and that she doesn't think me and my boyfriend should date anymore. I can't believe his mom is messaging me about this. I blocked her and messaged him that he needs to come and pick up his stuff that he's left at mine. Luckily it isn't much. He hasn't replied but I saw that he has shared a post on facebook about women being crazy. So I guess we're done.Thanks to everyone who took the time to respond. And sorry to everyone else who is dealing with annoying periods due to controception! It sucks!"
253,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my roommates gf that she's not woke if she's wrong,25256,lltqwg,2560,"**Edit: Whoa, I didn't expect this post to get huge. Thanks for all the feedback & opinions, everyone (even the ones who think this is fake. I sincerely hope you never meet someone like Anna in your life).** **Just some clarifications to clear the air:**1. **Why did I write this post? I've faced many Anna's in my life, but my comments about how its inappropriate has always been shut down (i.e., you're too sensitive/ they're just trying to be nice/ you're not being welcoming) by others (in other similar situations). It's confusing/ distressing, but I feel like Anna really hit my limit & I wanted to make sure that I'm not TA**2. **Is Anna white? She's of mixed heritage (Caucasian & African American). I personally feel like it added another sensitive layer in this entire mix & indirectly goes back to the point above**3. **Did I talk to her about this entire thing? I moved out of SEA to get rid of that 'you're not Chinese enough' mentality (I faced that from my own countrymen multiple times) & I don't celebrate Lunar New Year (thanks to those who recommended that term) outside of my home country for personal reasons (my family sucks & I don't have good memories attached to that holiday). I didn't think I would need to justify/ defend myself** ***again.*** **As for the separate incidences, not really (& that's my fault). I just told her don't do that again cause I don't like it. I should have explained to her why, & I accept responsibility for that**4. **How did she confuse kabuki masks & think hell notes were decoration? Based on what her bf said, she went to some Chinese website that sells everything & the translation was whacky so she just thought it was all the same**5. **The entire organ meat incident: she didn't expect me & SO to eat them raw. She expected SO & I to cook it cause she's seen me cook some herbal soups before (non had organ meat though)****Hope that clarifies things for everyone!**Husband (28M) & I (25F) are ethnically Chinese from a SEA country living overseas. We rent a house with SO's college friend who moved his gf (Anna) in during lockdown & she's been with us ever since (with landlord's permission & she pays her share of bills). They're not Asians, which matters.Anna was initially nice, but started acting very weirdly a month after she moved in:1. Telling SO & I that we can practice our 'real' religion (which apparently is Buddhism, not Christianity even though SO & I come from Christian families). She even bought incense (which gives me migraines) & a random Buddha statue. We politely explained to her that we're not Buddhists, but she continued to insist & promised that she didn't mind.2. Telling SO & I that we can speak our 'real' language cause she overheard SO's family talking to us in a mix of English & Cantonese. I explained to her that I can't speak Cantonese (SO can) even though I can understand it. She was, for some reason, really disappointed in me & said that I was throwing my heritage away. Plot twist: my own father is only comfortable speaking English.3. Buying raw internal organs for SO & I to cook, even though we don't eat those. I told her we don't eat that (not our thing), & she was again disappointed. She told us she read that there were lots of nice recipes & maybe we haven't found the right one to remind us of home. SO told her he's never eaten it ever in his life, & I've never liked it. She was really upset, but had to toss it since no one was gonna eat itChinese New Year was when things got really really weird. She started ordering 'decorations'. I wouldn't mind, but she had ordered hell notes (the ones burned for deceased ancestors). I immediately told her to stop pasting them all over the walls because they were weirding me out. She ordered banners with SO & my name on it (some bastardisation of our *legal* English names) but they were written on white banners (again, for deceased people). I told her to please take it down. She got upset (again), but then ordered kabuki masks. I told her that those masks were not Chinese, & she just snapped. She started yelling at me that I should be helping her & not critiquing what she was doing. I told her:1. She never asked2. CNY is not a big deal to me, so I wasn't planning on decorating but if she had asked, I would have helped3. She never askedI told her I don't understand her fixation with us. She said she wanted to surprise me & SO, that we've been so 'colonised' we've forgotten our roots, & that we should be embracing our culture. I told her it was a nice gesture, but she needs to stop forcing stereotypes down our throats. She could have just asked & she's not being woke when she's getting everything wrong.She burst into tears & brought in her bf. He understood where I was coming from, but thought I could have been nicer. SO stands by me, & now things have been tense, but I've been tolerating this for a while now & it was getting on my nerves."
254,Not the A-hole,AITA for not speaking to my parents again after they put my cat down,25205,fdyy9z,2292,"For context: I'm 28, the vets office is literally 10 minutes away.I had them take him because I have two herniated disks and can't carry the carrier and open the multiple doors and hold the carrier without fear of dropping it.  I thought he had a little cold with the only reasoning being that his ears felt a little warm, he wasn't eating as much as he normally does and he was due for his shots anyway. So I cooked dinner for all of us while they took him to the vet on my dime. I called them after an hour and asked how things were going and my father told me everything was good and he had a little fever. Fast forward another hour, they come back and let themselves in and I open the door to my mother sobbing and my father slinking in the corner. Turns out the vet found a large mass on his Kidney and suspected it was stage 3-4 cancer. So my parents, without calling me, had him put down to ""spare my feelings"".I told them both to leave and that I never wanted to speak to them again. That it wasn't their decision to make and they should have called and told me the situation so I could at the very least say good bye and be with him. That by failing to tell me, they stole an opportunity for any closure I could have. I raised that cat from a feral kitten with his mother and his brother from the time he had his eye's open. He was only 10.I'm equally heart broken and furious and they can't seem to understand why. They proceeded to berate and belittle me, going as far as to say I wasn't sad, just angry and that I was: ""ruining a beautiful and tragic moment"" and that it was my fault because I didn't go with them. Edit: As just to be clear the never wanting to see them again bit was after this attempt to make me feel bad for being angry.Am I the asshole here?Edit: I'm turning off reply notifications. 99% of you can form a reasonable response, NTA/YTA/ETA. I'm just sick of the ""YTA because it was just a cat"" people, who are clearly miserable assholes themselves. I hope they never have a pet for that pet's sake.&#x200B;"
255,Not the A-hole,AITA for pushing off a girl my lap and making her cry?,25204,i1z11d,1395,"I \[19M\] just started dating a girl I really, really like a couple months ago. I was hanging out with my friend (I'll call Joe\] who is also 19, and has a crush on this girl ""Sarah"" \[18F\]. Anyway, we were all hanging out and there were no more seats in the car, so I suggested she sit on Joe's lap, but she chose to sit on mine, so I put a jacket on my lap so she wasn't directly on me. I felt really uncomfortable because she's just sitting her bony ass on me and I have a girlfriend, who she knows I have.Anyway, when we stopped to get gas I made her sit on my friend's lap instead and she started to full on cry because I didn't want her to sit on me and I had put a jacket. I felt awkward and bad for my friend who likes her and she was just crying on his lap and said I was a jerk.She ended up texting me saying we have to talk about us and I said, ""what are you talking about 'us?'"" and she said that I was giving her mixed signals because she thought there was something between us. I said nope, I'm like this with all my friends, and she said I thought you were like that with Joe as a joke because he's just your friend but me it's because you liked me, and that it made her confused because she knows I have a girlfriend. I said ""nope, I'm like that with everyone"" and told her I'm happy with my girlfriend and I don't want to date her. She called me an asshole and I haven't seen her since. Her best friend texted me and said I was being an asshole. I told my girlfriend \[19F\] against my friends wishes (who are also her friends, not Sarah, but Joe is) and she laughed and said that boys are so oblivious and that she could tell Sarah had a crush on me but she trusted me to make the right choices. Basically, she didn't really care, just thought Sarah was kind of crappy for trying to go after a guy with a girlfriend.So, AITA? I legit didn't really know she had a crush on me. It kind of dawned on me that night. I never pursued her. I slept over her house once because I was too drunk to drive but I slept on the floor and didn't let her near me, and I would mention my girlfriend a lot because I'm excited about dating her. Apparently she thought I liked her because she once asked me if I would join her art club and I said sure. I don't understand girls. I really don't.&#x200B;Update: Wow, THIS BLEW UP! Sarah and Joe ended up hanging out on their own, apparently, and she ended up trashing me, saying I was an asshole, how she liked me, etc. Joe told me privately that he knew she had a crush on me but wanted to see what I would do/enjoy the show because he thought the drama was funny. She ended up texting me again and saying how I was a jerk and basically the friendship imploded. The last thing she said was that she wasn't sorry and I said ""well I can be sorry for the both of us."" Joe still has a crush on her and I'm sure he's still trying to date her. But, that's pretty much it for that. My girlfriend loves all the comments calling her a keeper and has found the entire situation hilarious. She really is a keeper. Thanks, everyone! "
256,Not the A-hole,AITA for letting my nephew to call me mom?,25167,g9t0d6,2001,"Awhile back, my brother married a woman who had an 11 year old son named ""Billy"". A year later my SIL gave birth to a little girl. Two years later, she gave birth to a boy. Billy, who was 14 by this time, was treated like an outsider. My SIL and brother saw him as a burden who spoiled their picture perfect family. If you asked my SIL how many kids she had, she would say two. Billy started acting out. He got involved with a bad group of kids and started getting into trouble. He started failing all of his classes. He eventually got into drugs and was suspended from school. My brother and SIL were fed up with him.I asked my brother if Billy could spend the summer with me and my husband. We have a hobby farm and I thought maybe getting away from his life for awhile could help him some. Well, they were more than happy to get rid of him (my SIL's words). It was kind of rough the first few weeks. He had a lot of anger issues. But my husband kept his hands and mind busy doing work on the farm. And we both made sure that he knew he was loved and wanted. By August, he was a totally different kid. He wanted to keep living with us but my SIL insisted that he come home. After two months, he went back to his old ways due to his parents indifference. They ended up sending him back to us and he lived with us throughout high school. He ended up being an A/B student and kept with a really great group of kids. He got involved in baseball and got a scholarship to a local university. He's 22 now and is in his last year of school. He's engaged to a really great girl.When he was 16 he started calling me Mom and he started calling my husband Pops. He never really had much to do with his mom and he had nothing to do with my brother. He saw them on holidays when the whole family came over. His mom has tried to have a relationship with him the past few years but he has avoided her. On Christmas, SIL was over and for what ever reason, she opened my desk drawer and found a birthday card from Billy where he said ""To the best mom ever. Thanks for loving me and giving me a chance."" She was devastated. She ended up texting Billy, confronted him and asked him if she would be presented as mother of the groom at his wedding. He told her that he no longer considered her his mom and wasn't even sure if he wanted her at the wedding at all.My SIL is now insisting that I make it clear to Billy that I am not his mother and that he is not to refer to me as such. My brother is also very upset with me. Even my parents are pressuring me to do what SIL wants for the sake of peace. Honestly, I consider Billy to be my son. I count him in with all of my children. I feel like telling Billy not to present me as mother of the groom could possibly be misinterpreted as me saying that I don't feel like he's my son and I don't even want to take a chance of that happening. If he decides to present his real mom as mother of the groom, I will 110% support him. So AITA for not respecting my SIL's wishes?Edited to add: I have zero desire to tell Billy not to call me mom and I absolutely won't do it because I know it would destroy him and it would kill me. My SIL insists that by not doing it, I'm making it impossible for her to have a relationship with him and I'm being selfish. I have talked to Billy about it some. He doesn't like to talk about his mom at all. He basically just said that he doesn't see her as a mom and has for sure decided he doesn't want her at the wedding. I understand and respect that. Also, I just want to thank everyone who left such sweet comments. I've been so choked up reading them all."
257,Not the A-hole,AITA For siding with my brother and SIL over my parents?,25130,i0hwki,1398,"My brother and my SIL have been married for 6 years. I love them both dearly. They adopted a little girl about a year ago. My parents were happy about this too, at first. They got really angry when my brother and SIL announced recently that their daughter would be their only child and they do not want biological kids.&#x200B;My mom and dad lost their shit. They told my brother he *had* to get my SIL pregnant. He was the family's male heir and he would have to have a biological son to carry forward the family name. This makes no sense to me, nor my bro and SIL. It's not as if we're a family of European royalty. Who gives a fuck about the family name in this day and age? Well, my parents do apparently. They've been berating my brother and guilt tripping my sister in law, making her feel like she's taking something away from our family. On one occasion they actually suggested that my brother leave my SIL if she didn't want to get pregnant and have a son with another woman.&#x200B;What's even worse is that they've stopped paying attention to my niece. Earlier, they would call and talk to her almost everyday. But ever since they were told about my bro and SIL's decision, they've stopped calling her. This pisses me off and has deeply saddened my bro and SIL. The child is  3 years old and doesn't deserve this kind of treatment.&#x200B;Yesterday, when I called my brother, he seemed very upset. He told me that mom and dad had called him and they had talked about something unrelated. When he asked if they wanted to talk to their granddaughter, they said they'd talk to their *real* grandchild when my brother came to his senses and decided to give them one.&#x200B;I was angrier than I've been in a long time. I called my parents and unloaded on them. I told them how selfish and cruel they were being  and how dare they take out their anger on my niece, along with a lot of other things I can't even remember. My mom started crying as she's not used to being yelled at. I understand that yelling at them may have been a bit much, but I just can't believe how awful they are being towards a kid. So am I the asshole? Or are they?&#x200B;&#x200B;EDIT  : Some people have been wondering how my parents would act when I have kids. No need to worry about that since I won't be having any. I made this clear to my parents years ago and yes they threw a fit over this. "
258,Not the A-hole,AITA for humiliating a man and his entire family when he proposed to me?,25127,ivbsso,1552,"On my phone, sorry about any formatting issues. I(28f) come from a very traditional Indian family. I left them when I came to USA for uni because I knew that if I accepted their help in paying my fees they would hold it against me later and I got a part time job along with the financial aid I was receiving. I maintained low contact and didn't visit them in person until I was 26, when they contacted me on my younger brother passing uni.For the last two years, I have visited them four times and each time they've been talking about marriage although I stated very clearly that I wasn't interested. They brought up kids and how finding guys willing to marry older women was hard. I said no problem because I'm child free and that I don't need/want them to find a guy for me.January this year, I went to visit them and they said that they had something 'special' for me and that I would absolutely love it. The day after I reached their home, they said they were throwing me a 'welcome home party'. I thought they were trying to fix our relationship and let it be.They invited a lot of people and it had obviously already been planned. An hour in, my parents introduced me to a man in his thirties(F) and his parents.So, next thing I know, F goes down on one knee and whips out a beautiful ring. I'm surprised and angry at my parents for still trying to control my life and putting me in such a situation.I said no, but then our parents began to push my buttons and I exploded. I called F, his parents and my parents low-lifes for trying to trick me and basically insulted their views, calling them misogynistic and disgusting.Told them to go f themselves and left. I packed my bags and went to stay at a hotel until it was time for my flight. My mom cried and begged me to stay and said that they had already paid for half of the dowry and ring. I stopped responding to my parent's calls and texts because I was done with them.My cousins and some old friends have been telling me that I was being unfair by being so rude to F and his parents. Thing is, they were in on it. They expected me to say yes and sent me a lot of insults when I refused to reconsider. They were humiliated and in their tiny group of small-minded people, my parents were being ostracized for raising a 'whore' of a daughter. F and his parents were also humiliated because they were rejected by a 'whore'. AITA for being so rude? I feel like I should've handled the situation more delicately, rather than blowing up at all of them.EDIT: Wow! I did not expect so many NTA's or responses. When I said that they were 'in on it' I meant that my parents had told them that I hadn't met the 'right guy' and that I would come around, which is why they kept trying. My parents expected me to surrender all my savings and money to F, live with F and his family in India, procreate with F three times and do all the housework when I can't even make a poached egg. About letting me go to college, I told them two weeks before leaving for it and lived at my friend's house with all my important documents, because I knew that they would do pretty much anything to keep me from going. They called my uni and said that I wouldn't be joining. Uni contacted me and I cleared it up. That's why I didn't talk to them and declined to let them pay.For those of you who told me to wear a faux ring- I'm engaged to my girlfriend of five years and my parents aren't getting an invite to the wedding. I knew that they'd ask me about it if they saw it and disapprove of anyone that wasn't Indian- let alone a female.Thank you for your responses and I am never talking to my parents again."
259,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling my parents assholes for what they did to my birthday,25128,kjoql2,3209,"I (21f) was one of those kids who was born on Christmas Day. Which I wouldn’t have minded at all if my parents treated this normally for example my friends boyfriend was also born on Christmas and he said his parents would do his birthday in the morning and Christmas in the afternoon and I wouldn’t have minded that at all. However my parents said it was greedy to have two celebrations on one day so I had to choose between having Christmas with everyone else ( my family and extended family) or have my birthday on Boxing Day and not take part in Christmas ( I wouldn’t have any presents or the chocolates and stuff everyone else would, I wasn’t even allowed to help with the Christmas tree)  This was pretty shit, either I had Christmas with everyone and wasn’t even wished happy birthday and because we wouldn’t be at school I never got happy birthdays from my friends or I was completely left out during Christmas and had a birthday where everyone was still focused on Christmas. And if I chose birthday my parents would tell my extended family I didn’t want Christmas and if I chose Christmas they said I didn’t want my birthday so I didn’t get both from my extended family. It made my childhood absolute hell and ruined holidays for me. My first Christmas/ birthday away from home was probably the best day of my life. Well cuz of Covid my family were talking about doing a zoom call for Christmas and my mum said “ well I guess op gets to chose to be part of the Christmas call or we call her on Boxing Day for her birthday “ I don’t know why but I just blew up and called her an asshole and said they ruined my childhood. It’s not like they couldn’t afford it my family is probably in the top 1% of the country money wise and even so I could’ve still taken part in festivities and only had one present. But my brothers are calling me selfish and my auntie says I need to apologise. And it’s Christmas so I feel like I should.Edit:OH MY GOD. THANK YOU EVERYONE SO MUCH!! I went to bed last night and woke up to about a million notifications. I’m sorry but I don’t think I can get through everyone but I’m definitely trying to!! I’ve had the best birthday/Christmas!! My best friend got me a Nintendo switch!! And we’re going to have a huge gaming competition together and we got leftovers of kfc for lunch!! Thank you all so much for the birthday and Christmas wishes I feel so honoured ! I love you all!!!"
260,Not the A-hole,AITA for calling a woman an idiot when she refused listen to why my daughter isn't vaccinated?,25128,lj2pxa,1708,"My (20f) 2yo daughter has had a heart transplant due to CHD and is severely immune compromised, as a result she cannot recieve live virus vaccines.I'm in a young mom's group on Facebook and the topic of daycares and being a SAHM came up. I said my boyfriend is the breadwinner and I stay at home with our daughter because I can't risk sending her to a daycare as she's not vaccinated. One woman, who is the same age as me with a newborn, started off, she's a new member, all the other women already know of my daughters medical history. She started calling me names and said I don't belong here if I'm so anti-vax. I told her my daughter is a transplant patient and can't be vaccinated. She just told me stop making excuses.I said, ""you're an absolute idiot, if you even looked at my profile for a second you'd know that I'm an advocate for vaccines and if you did a bit of research you'd know that giving someone who is severely compromised a live virus vaccine is a bad idea.""She was clearly very upset, she posted a rant about me onto the group and a few of the members said I was an asshole for calling her an idiot.AITA?Edit: If I could vaccinate my daughter or if I was confident every parent who sends there child to a daycare vaccinates their child, I would send her to one so I can work.Edit 2: I am not talking about the covid vaccine here"
261,Not the A-hole,AITA for bringing a baby to a class??,25118,inme22,1607,"hi please let me know because i’m honestly not sure. for context, my university is completely online, I’m male and 20 years old. Okay, last week, a family emergency happened, and it required my aunt and uncle to leave their house at late night. I live close to them, and they have a baby that’s less than a year old. So, they called my parents to tell them about the emergency, and then called me. They asked if I could come into their house, take care of their baby, until they came back, and I was down with that. I’ve taken care of babies before, so, this wasn’t new to me.Took my stuff, and drove to their house, stayed with my cousin. Now, by the time my morning class comes about, my aunt and uncle haven’t shown up yet, which was within expected (they told me they’ll be back by one-two PM), and I had my baby cousin in my lap, setting up laptop for my morning class, and my cousin falls asleep, and I’m like OK. I can deal with this. A sleeping baby is the best kind of baby. Do not move them. Now, here’s the problem. I had a presentation to do, and so my video is off, as I’m preparing to give it, and the professor goes “OP, please turn on your camera.”“Uhh. I have a sleeping baby right now, so… is that okay with you?”“A sleeping baby?”“Yeah, there was a family emergency, so my cousin’s asleep on me right now, um… I don’t want to say the details in class, but I can email you after class, and supply any proof you need.”“It’s fine, please turn on your camera.”So I do, and my cousin is asleep, and I give the entire presentation, and I’m really proud of how it went, because I think I did really well, and I answer all questions, and my cousin doesn’t wake up! Like this is the best case scenario.Well, last night, I got my grade for the powerpoint, along with an email from the professor that says she marked me down because she felt the baby was there as a pity prop, and I was attempting to gain sympathy, and if I hadn’t had the baby, I would’ve gotten higher.So was I the asshole for showing up with a baby? I didn’t think about the pity aspect.edit :- sorry for the sporadic replies. i am still a university student balancing my shit. few clarifications. Yes, I did send her the proof she would’ve required to see there was an emergency. Yes, I will be reporting - and updating. Yes, there are better ways I could’ve done this, but a stressed and sleep deprived student isn’t normally the best source of judgement. The class was a philosophy one."
262,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my stepdaughter she’s absolutely under no circumstances allowed to switch out my cats food for vegan food even though she’s losing weight because the sight of normal cat food makes her sick?,25077,ghwz34,3784,"Sorry for the appalling title. My stepdaughter is living with my husband and I for the next year. Shes an educated young professional who’s saving up to buy her own home. Since she’s moved in with us (past 3 months) she’s become increasingly snappy and unhappy with how her dad and I run our lives. We aren’t environmentally conscious enough because we don’t compost our waste, we are negligent because we leave lights on when we leave our home for security reasons, we should switch to electric cars, we are contributing to the inhumane treatment of cows by consuming dairy, the list is endless. My cat Mango is getting to be an old ass man and he has lived a full life of eating whatever the fuck he likes (obviously within what’s safe for a cat) and hes happy that way. My stepdaughter is now insisting she will purchase vegan cat food because seeing Mango eat meat makes her sick. We feed him in the kitchen and she will literally throw up / retch/ leave the kitchen if she sees him eat meat. She HAS lost a lot of weight since claiming that seeing Mango eat meat makes her sick, and we leave out dry biscuits for him to snack on which also makes her sick. It’s not like we leave mess out but even if she smells his food in the am (which is gross, yeah, but the doors are open and that’s just life if you have a pet) she will heave and walk away. Her dad and I both told her if she’s unhappy with it she needs to find someplace else to live and although we are genuinely sorry she’s lost her appetite and has lost weight we aren’t going to change Mangos lifestyle- she has yelled, cursed at us, cried, begged, etc, but no, we are NOT happy with Mango eating a vegan diet. We don’t feed him cheap crap either, we feed him food quality cat food that isn’t processed or full of sugar or grain. It’s pretty much gourmet Gordon Ramsey worthy cat food. My MIL has waded in after my stepdaughter told her we were being unfair by refusing to let Mango go on her preferred diet for him, and is accusing us of being cruel and shortsighted. She says we are letting her get sick, and that Mango won’t hurt from a change in diet but stepdaughter is hurting."
263,Not the A-hole,AITA for putting bacon on my lunch to keep my Muslim friend from stealing it,24996,fg57ge,2365,"I’m not a super healthy person. At school for lunch, I usually get cheese fries. I know, very unhealthy. But one of my friends sure likes to steal my fries, as well as food from our other friends at the table. He’ll grab a bit from our trays and eat it when we’re not looking sometimes. It’s not usually a lot; it’s more so just a nuisance. So I had an idea. My friend who likes to snatch our food sometimes is Muslim, and he keeps halal. Our school cafeteria gives us the option to get bacon on our fries too (I love America). I wouldn’t get bacon on my fries otherwise, but I would rather do that than set a precedent of my friend stealing my food. When I first sat down at our table, he said “What the fuck man? Why’d you do that?” My friends sided with him. They said I went too far by not “respecting” his dietary restrictions. Too which I replied, “his dietary restrictions shouldn’t matter if he doesn’t eat my food”. I think I was totally in the right to do that, but my friends just thought it was petty because I didn’t get bacon before and I only started getting it to give him the finger. Thoughts?"
264,Not the A-hole,"AITA For building a Fence and blocking my neighbours from the road, forcing them to take a massive detour?",24994,ics68m,1277,"So I am the owner of a large house with a huge property surounding it. When I bought my property 5 years ago I basically lived at least 5 minutes away from the nearest house, however the villages and towns have been expanding and as a result started developing houses next to my property.I was fine with it, nothing I could do about it to begin with, but my property is big enough not to really notice to begin with, or so I assumed.It's good to mention I basically pulled out a bunch of trees when I moved here and made a dirt road with gravel of sorts to allow me easy access to the main road nearby instead of driving all the way around to access the main road.Well soon after people started moving in to the houses I noticed people basically used my little road to access the main road nearby and kids used my field to play football, I was pretty much okay with it because it wasn't bothering me or inconveniencing me.Untill a few months later that was, basically whenever people had a party or a gathering I noticed my road and the field which they drove over was full of cars and a few weeks later some people started straight up using it as a parking area. I had multiple talks with multiple people and the results ranged from apologetic people moving their cars to aggressive people who told me to go F myself.I finally had enough and started getting cars towed which led to people yelling at my girlfriend in particular, as such I build a large stone fence around my entire property.Well multiple neighbors including the aggressive ones were all apologetic and asked me to remove the fence and how sorry they were for using it as they basically had to add 15 to 20 minutes to their travel time to work without my shortcut, I told them to go F themselves and to get the F of my property and if I saw them there again I'd be letting my dogs loose.However this is also impacting the nice neighbors so I am conflicted."
265,Not the A-hole,AITA for threatening to financially cut off my son over a baby name?,24989,ht049f,2722,"I had my son fairly young and I recently had a change of life baby. When I was four months pregnant my son, who was in college at the time told me that he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. I wasn't very happy but I've been supportive and I've given them a lot of financial assistance.I had my daughter two months ago and named her Clara. My son's girlfriend went ballistic. She said they were going to name their daughter Clara and that I should have consulted with them (umm I got pregnant first, but whatever) I told her she needs to grow up and that she doesn't own the name. My son asked me if I would consider changing Clara's name. I said no and he stormed out of the house.Well they told me the other day they are going to name their daughter Paxtyn. I guess I made a face and she started yelling at me that it is my fault, because I stole the only name she likes. I even asked her if she likes the name Paxtyn and she said she is going to like it when I have to tell my friends I have a granddaughter named Paxtyn. So she pretty much said she hates me more than she loves her daughter.My son said I have two months to fix this (change Clara's name) and I told them that they are both idiots, and I feel bad for their future child. I also said if they name their daughter Paxtyn just to be spiteful I will not give them any further assistance. My son called me up and said I was being controlling, but when I asked him if he actually likes the name he hung upEdit: They never mentioned the name Clara to meSecond Edit: Alright, I took some of your advice and texted her that I've been thinking about it and I kind of like the name Paxtyn and she wrote back ""fuck you, you evil bitch"" so I think that's the end of their money."

We're having quite a large wedding (fiance has a big family, and we have a lot of friends), but my family is very small. My only family is my mom (never met my dad), and I have an aunt and uncle who are childfree. Since I was little, having no father I always wanted my uncle to walk me down the aisle.My mom married my step dad when I was 12, and I've never liked him. He's a bully. He says horrible things to people, says racist, sexist, transphobic things for attention, and heavily contributed to my mental illness and eating disorder as a teenager. My mom knows that we don't get along, and she knows I didn't like him, but I gave up on confiding in her about how much I disliked him when I was around 15, because she would always insist that despite having a nasty mouth, he was a really good guy and he would never hurt us. So, it's been around 8 years since I've told my mom I hate him. I moved out when I was 19 with my boyfriend. I visit my mom maybe 3-4 times a week, I would try to time this around my step dad working so I wouldn't see him. As a result of seeing him less, I was more able to ignore his horribleness and we stopped arguing. I mostly stopped talking to him. He still refers to me as his daughter and my mother insists he loves me. It is not mutual, but everyone has assumed that I love him too and our relationship is just based on 'banter' rather than tormenting.So, when I got engaged, I asked my uncle almost straight away if he would walk me down the aisle. He was over the moon, but my aunt was like 'oh, you aren't picking step dad?' and I said no, I've always wanted uncle to do it. A few hours later, my mom called me crying asking why I wouldn't want step dad to do it, saying it's broken his heart. I told her that I've always dreamed of having uncle do it. She pressed on about how heartbroken he is, saying he always thought we had a good, funny relationship. This is where I feel like an ass. I said, 'there was nothing funny about him ruining my self esteem and teenage years. I hate him and if it were up to me, he wouldn't even be at the wedding'. My mom said that she's horrified that I still feel this way, once again spouting that he's a good guy and he loves me. I repeated that I hate the guy, and she said she'll tell him to back off.He's now angry at me and has asked my uncle not to walk me. My uncle is now not speaking to him, and I feel like I've torn what little family I have apart. AITA?"
267,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking girlfriend out after she deleted dead wife’s pictures from my phone?,24947,hy04og,3100,"My (25m) wife died 19 months ago. It was real hard on my the first few months but finally started putting myself back out there. I met girlfriend (23F) 7 months ago. It was going pretty well and she moved into my apartment around 4ish months ago. In hindsight we probably rushed this.My girlfriend is very overprotective and clingy and scared of me cheating as she’s been hurt in the past. I let her have my phone password so she could ease her mind. She saw a photo of me and wife and asked who she was and I explained. She seemed to take it well but was a little bit awkward about it.Fast forward 3 days and I go to take a shower and leave my phone on charge in the bedroom. I come out to see my phone unlocked. Weird but I let it slide. Later in that day I go through my photos to upload a new profile picture to Facebook. All the photos of my wife and me and her together are gone without a trace. I check my Snapchat my eyes only because I had a few in there along with intimate photos of us together. I knew it was my girlfriend.I confronted her about it and she started yelling. She said I need to get over it and get rid of all the reminders of my wife because she was here now. She also called me really creepy for “having nude pictures of a dead girl”. (Granted i probably should have deleted those a long time ago but I didn’t want to because they were special to me, might be AH on my part there). I was livid. I told her to get out. She stared at me in disbelief as I told her again. She packed some stuff and left. I went to my room and cried. I woke up to many missed calls and angry texts from her and her friends for calling me the AH. This might not have been a big deal but she permanently got rid of 95% of the pictures of my wife. I still have some printed like the wedding and some vacations, but I’m still missing a big chunk of them. I feel like she deleted a part of me as well. I’ve had to block multiple numbers (including my sisters, wtf). I do miss her though and want to talk but I’m confused. Reddit, am I in the wrong?Edit: SpellingEdit 2: Thank you all so much for your kind words and support. I’m taking your advice and kicking her out of my life for good. I’m also going to my local tech store later as they said there might be a way to recover my photos. I love you all !"
268,Not the A-hole,"AITA for supporting my wife after my daughter publicly exposed her diary which had ""cruel"" comments?",24959,hqgdyb,2620,"I have been remarried for a year now to my wife. I have a 15 year old daughter and a 11 year old son from my first marriage. I also have a 15 year old stepdaughter.My wife has always gotten along with my children very well and has gone above and beyond to integrate our families.And although at first my daughter was very standoffish to my wife, my wife was eventually able to bond with her. Only then did we get married.A few weeks ago, my daughter found my wife's diary that she had been writing to when we went to marital counseling before we got married. Both our first marriages were terrible so we were determined to do it right. I also was given a diary.My daughter then proceeded to read everything and even take photographs of certain pages. She then posted the photographs on Facebook and called my wife a bunch of cruel names.My wife had written a few things about how she wished I didn't have kids before we met so we could have had less issues dealing with my ex.She also said how she hated that my daughter had picked up so many bad traits from my ex.And the last thing related to my kids was that she said my ex was a terrible mother for weaponizing her kids.I admit I was taken aback and upset that my wife had written these things because I knew my kids would be hurt.But this was also a personal diary as part of a therapy exercise and the diary had been hidden in our closet.My daughter even posted some very sensitive information about my wife dealing with her father who was an alcoholic.My wife is inconsolable. A lot of my family and friends have turned on my wife because they think what she wrote was terrible.I disagree. She wrote things that she was concerned would affect our marriage and the counseling actually helped us deal with having stepchildren. And it's not like I shared the same opinion about my ex.I'm just so defeated. My daughter will no longer see me if my wife is around and won't step foot in our house. My son is following her lead. My wife has already apologized several times.My ex has said she will be starting the process to reduce my custody and sue for defamation. I know she won't win the defamation case but I feel like custody will indeed switch. I'm very stressed out.My daughter refused to take down the diary pages and insists she's in the right.I have taken my wife's side in all this. Am I the asshole? My entire family has been blown up."
269,Not the A-hole,"AITA for giving my child a ""culturally inappropriate"" name?",24954,el460c,4752,"I am black, and my wife is also black. I spent my most of my childhood in the foster system, but for a good part of it I was taken care of by an elderly Russian gentleman (we'll call him Dimitri Petrovitch). While he never formally adopted me, he played a major role in my upbringing, and I am very grateful for all that he has done for me. Unfortunately, he passed away many years ago, and he never had any children. Fast forward to today, my wife and I recently had a son, and to honor the memory of my mentor, I decided (with my wife's approval) to name my kid Dimitri Petrovitch Williams. Williams being my last name, and Petrovitch being my son's middle name. However, it seems like it's only my wife and I who likes this name, as her extended family has been quite upset over it, saying things like ""What kinda name is Dimitri?"", or ""You ain't white, you ain't Russian, why did you give your son such as a white name."" It's true that there's no part of me that's Russian (I an barely speak Russian), but I feel like he's been such a big part of my upbringing that I had to honor him somehow. I confided in my friends too, and they said something along the lines of ""You a black man and you gotta be proud of your own culture. You gave your son an identity that he's not even a part of, he's gonna have a hard time in school with that name.""So my wife's family aren't happy with our decision, and it seems like my friends don't really have my back either. I'm keeping the name that's for sure, but should I have reconsidered? Maybe I could've honored my mentor in another way?"
270,Not the A-hole,"AITA for ""hacking"" my moms instagram to see if she violated NDA?",24912,jkqq4c,2134,"I'm a nanny for a high profile family. I signed a very extensive and strict NDA. Anyone directly involved in my life, mom, dad, sis, and husband, also signed an NDA. The nanny family recommended this, to talk about the job without getting into any legal trouble or putting them at risk.Recently ran into one of my parents' neighbors, Amber, at the park. Amber asked how the new job was going, then proceeded to ask specifics about how it must be working for a family where the parents are (insert their jobs here). A direct violation of the NDA and something I could be fired and sued for.My dad isn't the sharing type, like at all, so I figured it was probably my mom. I asked her about it in a casual “Hey how’s Amber,” way. I said I ran into Amber at the park and that it was odd because she knew details about my job without me telling her. My mom simply shrugged and said, ""That's funny. Maybe she googled? Or saw something on social media?""My dad and sister absolutely hate Amber. They essentially said hell would have to freeze over before they spoke to her willingly. My dad ended our convo where I asked him about it by saying, ""The only thing I know about her is that her son just made partner at a law firm in New York and is making bank and that's only because mom saw it on instagram and told me about it.""Right then, I knew my mom lied to me and it was her. She and Amber love to ""one up"" each other with their children's success, and I also just landed a great new job. I asked my mom about it AGAIN and she told me that I was being dramatic, making stuff up, and that she would never do that to me.My mom doesn't text people, only DM's on instagram. I know her password so logged in to check her messages. There was an extremely long DM to Amber where she shared their professions, children's names, ages, private school, general locations of their homes, how they pay ""really well"", etc. Everything that we are legally NOT allowed to say, she said.I called her immediately and said that I logged into her DM's and saw the message she sent Amber that was a violation. She started screaming at me about how she is supposed to be able to trust her daughter, she can't believe I hacked into her instagram, that mothers should be allowed to brag about their children, and then she hung up.It has been a week without contact between the two of us. We used to speak every single day. I am starting to believe that maybe I'm the asshole here for violating her trust like that. My husband says if anyone violated trust here it is her and that I gave her ample opportunity to tell the truth before I intervened and sought out the truth myself. He constantly reminds me that they could sue us into the ground, and fire me, for endangering my nanny family's well being. Because truthfully, Amber could easily be a psycho fan or sell the information to someone who is. So, AITA?"
271,Not the A-hole,AITA for cutting off my family over my mom's will?,24909,gersvf,1635,"I always suspected my mom preferred my sister over me.  Growing up, she spoiled my sister with whatever she wanted and took her word over mine whenever we argued.  I was always in second place compared to her.  For example, when we turned sixteen, I was given my aunt's old clunker that ended up dying within six months.  When my sister turned sixteen, she got the brand new red Volkswagon of her dreams.  Mom said that I couldn't continue my piano lessons because they were getting so expensive while still supporting my sister's dance lessons, competions, etc.  Things got really bad about a decade ago.  When we were in high school, I feel in love with this guy, Joey, and started dating him for a while.  Only to for him to dump me because he preferred my sister.  Yes, my sister seduced him.  This really broke me because he was my first love.  Well, my sister and Joey ended up getting married after their college graduation.  And that is when things went from bad to worse.  Our mother had her will made and she was leaving everything to my sister.For background information, our childhood home was a two story building, where my mother's flower shop was on the ground floor and the apartment we grew up in was the second floor.  While I didn't get along with my mom or sister, I loved that flower shop and had been working there for most of my life.  I dreamed of owning that shop one day.But instead, my mother was going to leave the building, the shop and the apartment, to my sister.  While I could still work in the shop, my sister would be the owner and I would have to do what she says.  There was no use in trying to convince her to change her mind.  In her mind, my sister was the married one with a baby on the way.  She needed the business and house to raise her family.  Meanwhile, I was single and had nothing.So, I cut them off.  If my mother didn't see me as a family member, then I wanted nothing to do with them anymore.  It was clear who she favored more.  So I moved out of my childhood home and was on my own.  Less than a year later, I joined the Peace Corps and have been living abroad since.Now, to the present.  After not hearing from them for years, my sister found me on social media and reached out to me.  She wanted to talk to me, rekindle whatever relationship we had.  I told her no, that I never wanted to talk to her or have anything to do with her or our mother again.  She then starts to write this angry message about how I could do this to her and why would I turn my back on her.But as far as I am concerned,  she is not my family.  She hasn't been family in a decade.  My partner and our baby is family.  I have a new, happier, more fulfilling life in South Africa than I ever did back in the States.  I don't want to ever see my old family again because of how they treated me.  I don't want them to meet my daughter.  If I let them back into my life, I am afraid they will ruin the new life I made for myself.  AITA and being too harsh?Edit- Holy shit!  I am flabbergasted.  But for those who are guilding this post or are planning to, please donate your money to the Covid-19 first responders instead."
272,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to lie to my mother's husband about how I met my husband?,24874,hl4btk,2093,"My mother and I have never gotten along. She's very serious, overachiever, type A and I've always clashed with people like that. She is also pretty self righteous about things like pride, and work ethic, and she just isn't my type of person. I feel bad because I'm her only child and I really wish she had a daughter she could actually enjoy.My mom wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer, because that's what her friends kids were doing, but I rebelled pretty hard against school. I left home the day I turned 18 and got by through modeling, working at clubs with a fake ID, and dating rich men. She always said I would understand her disappointment when I had daughters, but I have two and I cant imagine being ashamed of something so petty.I met my husband when I was working as a yacht girl. That kind of just means I was paid by rich men to party on their boats and keep the guests entertained. I did date some of those men and they were very generous. My mom views that as prostitution. I don't know if I agree but I 100% think prostitution should be legalized so I don't really care. I met my husband. he scandalized his entire family by marrying one of *those* girls and we've been very happy for eighteen years. I do have an easy life and I'm not going to lie and say it has nothing to do with looks, but they were my looks to do whatever i want with.My mom doesn't like my husband. She thinks we both partied too much and she was hoping I'd grow up and do something ""respectable"" one day. She hates that he enables me to have the life she didn't want me to have. Well i met her new husband the other day. He works in finance, nice enough guy, but very straitlaced. He asked how i met my husband and I told him, the true story.My mother was furious and I did know she would want me to lie or leave some details out,but it's my story to tell and I'm not ashamed of my life. My husband thinks I should have lied and said it was full on prostitution, but he's kind of an ass. My mom actually cried after dinner so AITA?"
273,Not the A-hole,AITA for taking my ex-gf off my insurance policy to force her to give me full custody of my daughter?,24855,ilrb5f,2559,"Me and my ex gf, Hayley, have one daughter 15F, Elle. I genuinely don't know if I was right to do what I did. Around 4 years ago, Hayley had a very bad accident. That ended with her being wheelchair bound. This caused her to develop a lot of resentment towards me. She would get angry if I worked out or played any sports. So, I stopped doing anything physical mostly. We tried counseling for a year and things didn't improve. In the end, we broke up. Ever since Elle was born, I took out a private insurance for me, Elle and Hayley. This helped out a lot when she had her accident. Post break up, I still kept her in my insurance because she couldn't find any work and I knew if I dropped her from the insurance, she wouldn't be able to afford any treatments. It's been 2 years since then. We have 50/50 custody, so I don't pay any child support. In the beginning, I kept a very keen eye to make sure that she didn't resent Elle like she resented me. She didn't, so I relaxed. She is still on that insurance because she is not able to find any job except wellfare. I wanted both Hayley and Elle to be well, so I kept the insurance. Half a year ago when Elle came to stay, I noticed that  she was very depressed and had gotten very fat compared to before. Nothing overweight. But Elle does ballet and I have never seen her put on that much weight. Turns out Hayley forbade Elle from doing ballet because ""Hayley used to do ballet and Elle is just trying to rub her face in it"". The same for any physical activities like sports or exercising. With the quarantine, it must have been hell to live like that. Elle pretty much broke down and said that for the past few months, things have been escalating to the point that she is scared to walk inside her own house. She just stays in her room and comes out only to eat. Elle just begged me to go to court, so that I can get full custody. Elle is at an age where her opinion matter in court, but it's almost impossible to get 100 percent custody in my state unless I can prove incompetency, according to my lawyer. So, I dropped her from the insurance. Elle was supposed to stay with me for the next 6 months. Hayley couldn't get a job. She wiped out her savings as she had to pay for all her treatments. It was getting to the point that she couldn't even afford to get basic things for herself, let alone Elle. I also applied for sole custody. Given her financial situation and the pandemic and Elle's preference, the judge gave me full custody with supervised visitation for Hayley. Hayley didn't have a good representation at court due to her financial situation. Also, there is a pandemic going on. I left an already vulnerable person without any medical insurance. I know I did what i had to do to protect my child. But I did so by taking advantage of the medical expenses of a disabled woman. Elle is happy. Hayley obviously thinks I am a manipulative bastard. Everyone seems to have mixed opinions. AITA here? Also, dropping her from my insurance was completely legal. I am not from US."
274,Not the A-hole,AITA for demanding my mom apologize after she blew up at my girlfriend who she thought was being racist?,24857,lyceex,2125,"I’m black and my girlfriend is Filipino. My parents aren’t the biggest fans just because we come from different socioeconomic backgrounds and they don’t think I should be with a “rich girl”My parents came over for dinner last night and my girlfriend was going to cook. Neither of us cook much and we eat way too much takeout, so she decided to make fried chicken because it is something she made with her mom growing up. Her mom came here from the Philippines and I guess it is pretty popular over there.When my mom saw the fried chicken she thought that my girlfriend was either making fun of her or just going off a racial stereotype. She immediately started cussing at her and demanding an apology. I explained to my mom that fried chicken is popular in the Philippines and I googled it to show her that there are a lot of Filipino recipes.She calmed down but did not apologize. I asked if she was going to apologize and she said it was just a misunderstanding. I said she should still apologize and she got offended, so I asked her to leave. I’m not talking to her until she apologizes but I don’t know if that is too harsh."
275,Not the A-hole,AITA for not apologising to my roommate’s girlfriend because she saw me naked?,24833,k4unec,2044,"Basically this. My roommate (21m) and I (20m) aren’t close friends but we live together because it’s convenient for both of us. He has a new girlfriend and lately she’s been staying over a lot. Our apartment has two bathrooms, I’m saying this because it’s relevant later, one is in my room and the other one is in the hall. I use the one in my bedroom and he uses the other one. Yesterday, I was just out of the shower and walking around in my room naked, trying to find clothes and other stuff cause I’m messy, when his girlfriend barges into my room without even knocking. I do generally lock my room, but it’s never been a big deal because my roommate never comes in w/o knocking. Also, I did not know this girl was in the house. I’d have made sure to lock the door then. Obviously she went like wtf and ran out. Then she was very cross with me, and seemed to think that I owed her an apology because she saw me naked and it made her very uncomfortable. I was nope, you walked into my room w/o knocking, what you see or didn’t see after that is NOT my fault. At all. Her explanation was that the other bathroom was busy and she just wanted to use the one in my bedroom. She’s involved roommate into this and he too thinks that I should apologise because I shouldn’t have been walking around in my room naked without locking the door first. I’ve refused to apologise. AITA?"
276,Not the A-hole,AITA for not cleaning while I cook just to prove a point to my husband?,24835,kdp90m,2120,"I've always cleaned as I cook so that when it gets to the end of the meal, there's minimal mess. My husband is the opposite. When he cooks, it's like a bomb went off. I've encouraged him to clean as he cooks, and if we're doing a big meal/holiday meal together I often make sure to assign him that role.Like most people, one of us cooks, the other one cleans up. I am the better cook, so I cook like 80% of the time. He gets an easy cleanup.I'm busier than usual at work, so he's had to step up. Whenever he's done, the kitchen is a mess. I don't even get how it happens, there will be oil splatters untouched, stuff drying to dishes, peels and meat. I'm not about to let food sit out overnight so after I'm done eating I'll start the process and won't get to really relax much.Last week I asked if he could please try cleaning as he cooks. He told me ""the rule is one person cooks, the other person cleans."" I said ""I get that but you're leaving me with a huge mess every night.""He said ""I just don't have the time to clean up when I'm focused on cooking"" knowing full well I'll see him scrolling on his phone.I just got so fed up, so on Sunday I made a big pot of chili. I didn't clean up as I worked, when I was done, I served him, sat down, enjoyed a beer and dinner.When he finally went into the kitchen, he said ""What the fuck? Why is there such a mess?""I said that I was too busy paying attention to the chili to clean up. I started to get ready for bed. He was like, ""Uhh you're just going to leave this here?"" and I said yes. He said he would have to wake up extra early to clean up and that he had to be at work earlier than usual and was supposed to play a game with his friends later that night, so could I just clean up.I said no, I cooked, so he has to clean.Two days later he's still pissy with me because he ended up not being able game and told me that he didn't get enough sleep and was exhausted at work (not to be TOO snarky, but it's not like he's a surgeon) because I had to ""prove a point"" to him. I told him that nothing else seemed to get his attention, and I feel pretty justified. He told me I was being a smug asshole about it and it was childish.AITA? Or is he?**EDIT:** A couple of people asked how we can make so many dishes, it should take 15 minutes, etc. We don't have a dishwasher (there's no room for one), so everything has to be done by hand. Additionally, ""doing the dishes"" means cleaning up the counters and stovetop and sweeping the floor, taking out the trash if need be.When I make chili, it's a process starting w/ dried chilies that I toast, soak, seed, pulverize, etc. Then there's cooking the dried beans, then there's the onions and garlic and the peels, any other veggies, seeding tomato, cans of tomato, grinding the spices, etc. Then there's grating cheese for the top, etc. It definitely left a ton of dishes and other stuff behind.**EDIT 2:** Sorry guys I was reading comments as I was at work, I thought this would get like... 10 comments tops. So another thing that comes up is ""whoever cooks also cleans"" but since I cook most of the time, I just don't see that as being also fair to me. I'll end up spending almost every single day after work (I've been ending work at 6 or 7 some days lately) cooking AND cleaning. If I had him cook more I would definitely start to gain weight and then we'd have another issue altogether HAHAHAHA.**FINAL EDIT:** Thanks for all the feedback everyone. Oh and sorry to the people on ""AmITheAngel"" for the ""humblebraggy"" way I mentioned I make chili. Didn't mean to make you guys feel inferior because I toasted a few chilies. Lmao. ""Oh it's so fishy because she used dried beans"" Makes sense why people are asking for my recipe if the concept of toasting chilies and using dried beans is so novel. Lmao."
277,Not the A-hole,AITA - Wife got my Sister fired,24834,iv4o47,916,"I am currently fighting with my wife.She has a high position at a University.  She's has her PHD and has little respect for people who don't have an education.My sister is the same age as my wife, and she is also very successful.  Probably a bit more than my wife.  She doesn't have the education my wife does, but she has managed to be successful; she does lie on her resume saying she has a BA degree.Recently, my sister was hired as a big wig for a company in NYC.  My wife was so angry when she heard about it.  She said that my sister was a liar and a fraud and that she should never have been given the job.Flash forward 2 weeks.  My sister calls me to tell me that she was let go because someone called the office to let them know that she did not have a BA degree.When I brought this up to my wife she admitted that she did in fact call my sister's job and let them know.I was stunned with this news.  My sister is responsible for taking care of our sick mother, and she is an incredible person.  She has worked over 2 decades in her field and she has been very successful.  I'm aware that she should not lie on her resume, but the company hired her after a background check, and at the end of the day, wtf cares?I had a huge fight with my wife about butting into my sisters business.  I pointed out that she herself has lied about her experience at times, and that she should have stayed out of it.  Now my sister is unemployed and I have no idea how she is going to pay for our mother's nursing home fees.  I have little money and my wife certainly isn't going to help.  This decision by my wife is causing unbelievable ripples in our family.  My sister helps pay for our nieces college, she's paid for our other sisters medical care after major surgery, and she's also helped me out by paying for my rehab 3 years ago when my insurance wouldn't cover the full 30 days.  She also donates 10% of her income to St. Jude's children's hospital.  She's a good person who wasn't able to afford college.My wife is livid with me for being angry with her.  She says that I should support her and understand that this is a major issue for her; people lying about degrees, etc. and that it's my sister's fault for lying...and that maybe now she'll get a job that she's actually qualified for.I have not told my sister that my wife got her fired, and my wife has threatened to leave me if I tell her.AITA for being angry at my wife for doing this to my sister?  AITA for not telling my sister how this happened?"
278,Not the A-hole,AITA for banning everyone who critiques our parenting from meeting our son?,24796,e0muyw,3464,"My wife has minor anxiety and ocd. She has been on meds for a long time, but had to go off them when she got pregnant. None of the pregnancy safe meds worked for her. Pregnancy was really tough for her, she spent a lot of time reading about what foods and activities and such could harm a fetus, and she was basically paralyzed by fear that she was hurting our son whenever she did anything. It was really rough for her and she hated being pregnant. She had a mental breakdown and confessed to me that she didn’t want to breastfeed, she was feeling violated by the pregnancy and wanted her body back and to go back on her meds, but she was worried that our son would be terribly harmed if she didn’t. I talked her out of breastfeeding because the pros were far outweighed by the cons and she clearly didn’t want to do it.After the delivery, I was using the bathroom and my father was in the room with my wife. A lactation consultant came in and asked my wife if she was ready to breastfeed. My wife said she wasn’t going to breastfeed and the lactation consultant started pushing and reminding her of the benefits of breastfeeding (which to my wife, was reminding her of all the ways she was harming our son by not breastfeeding.) my father also started pressuring her. She said she just kept saying “I don’t want to,” but was very close to capitulating because she was so tired and anxious and she just wanted it to end. I came back into the room and kicked out the lactation consultant and my dad for not listening to her when she said no.Things got considerably better when we left the hospital. My wife was able to get back on her meds and was happy. This was the first part of the pregnancy/birth process that she actually got to enjoy. Her meds can take up to a month or two to have full effect, so the anxiety and ocd issues are still there, but much less.The conflict comes in because I told my dad he couldn’t be around my wife and son for the time being because he participated in pressuring her when she said no. I’ve also run into an issue when sending pictures of the baby to family. A number of people wrote back nitpicking how my wife my holding the baby, what she was feeding him, the crib we’re using and so on. I stopped sending photos, but my wife and I talked and she said she was still feeling fixated on everything she was doing wrong as a mom, and these critiques would make it worse.So I told everyone who critiqued our parenting that they can’t come meet the baby. They probably can in a month or so when my wife will be more secure mentally and as a mom, but until then, no one can come. Thus far, the only people who have met my son are my wife’s parents, her sister, and my mom.A lot of my family is saying that this is unfair because they have good intentions and are just trying to help. My mom told me I should give them a chance, but I think the risk is too big. Am I the asshole for banning them?"
279,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling someone I can read lips,24745,hidzc5,858,"This happened pre COVID btw.I've had hearing loss for most of my life , but it was diagnosed when I was about 7 years old. So I learned to read lips at the same time I was learning to speak. I'm very proficient in reading lips.Whenever I work with someone new, I make sure to let them know that I have hearing loss and to make sure that they are facing me and I'm aware they're talkin to me.I've never actually mentioned to any co-workers that I could read lips & but I'm pretty sure most of them at least suspect it strongly.A new co-worker started and I did my customary introduction and disclaimer about my hearing. I don't think she believed me because she got very offended when I ignored her. The problem being she was trying to get my attention from behind me and I genuinely did not hear her. Once someone got my attention I apologize to her and pointed out that I did have hearing loss and I wasn't aware that she was talking to me.A few days later she was venting to a mutual coworker. The only problem was she was facing me and I could read her lips perfectly. After a few minutes I approached her and let her know that if she was going to s*** talk someone she needed to make sure they couldn't understand her and that I was reading her lips the entire time.I told her I was upset that she wouldn't just come to me, and that I did tell her twice that I was partially deaf and couldn't hear her. She freaked out because apparently I was being rude by reading her lips when she was facing me"
280,Not the A-hole,"AITA for refusing to give ""back"" a gift that my boyfriend's daughter (13) had already refused to accept?",24746,eij1on,2225,"My boyfriend (37M) has two daughters. A 10 year old and a 13 year old. We've been dating for about 3 years now. I get along well with the younger daughter and she and I'm kind of like a big sister/auntie to her. The older daughter does not like me and makes it clear that she would rather her father not date me (or anyone else from what I gather). Boyfriend and his ex share custody and this year, since my boyfriend had them for Christmas, I got them both presents (got them both necklaces). 10 year old was very excited and happy with her gift. 13 year old got huffy and said she didn't want anything from me and refused to ""accept"" the gift. 10 year old also opened 13 year old's gift after she refused to accept it and I could tell that she did like what I'd got her. I decided to keep it for myself. Fast forward to today, 13 year old calls and she wants the necklace. She didn't apologise for her rude behaviour from before or anything (which I honestly don't care too much about). She asked me to give it to her since it's ""hers"" and ""you already bought it"". I told her that it wasn't hers since she refused to accept the gift and that I'm not going to give it ""back"" to her. She got upset and complained to my boyfriend who told her it was up to me whether or not I wanted to give her the gift anymore. Am I being too harsh on her? My sister thinks I'm just making my own life more difficult by not just giving it to her. Is it petty of me? AITA for refusing to give a gift that I did buy for her?**Edit: ok, I did not expect this post to get so much attention. Just to clarify a few things that are being asked, I'm 27. No, this is not the first time I've got them gifts. I didn't write down my thought process properly; I've got them gifts before but they were ""experiences"" based gifts (for an example passes to amusement parks etc). This year because I was actually spending the day with them, I wanted to give a ""proper"" gift that they can actually keep and immediately ""have"" if that makes sense. And yes I kept it for myself, what else am I supposed to do with a rejected gift?** **Anyway..I realise that I did not handle this in the best way. I'll be seeing her today and explaining to her how I felt and why  didn't want to give it to her again and explain that perhaps we both could learn to appreciate the sentiment behind gifts better.I think I will decide what to do with the actual gift after having a proper conversation with her and seeing how that goes (especially since I already exchanged the necklace for a different one and no longer have the original one I got for her). Thanks for all the ideas as to how to approach her and this conversation. And yes I understand that she is still dealing with her parents breaking up and I feel for her, I really do.**"
281,Not the A-hole,"WIBTA if I quit my job, sell my share in company and retire to be a ski patroler? I would essentially leave my adult kids (18 and 22) to fend for themselves with no way to pay for college. Ex wife as well.",24739,blich3,4575,"So years and years of backstory here. Ex wife has BPD and life with her has been a continuous struggle. We are in the middle of a divorce because while she’s lied, stolen, abused, hit, etc... she never cheated. But she crossed that line and enough was enough. Divorce is bitter and ugly. For financial reasons we had set kids college savings up with my wife as custodian. I implored kids to go to the brokerage companies to remove wife as a custodian now they were adults. The both blew me off and “yeah yeahed” me for almost a year. Ex cleaned out every penny of the accounts, probably to buy her new house. Instead of my kids even asking thier mom why, let alone taking legal action they both held their hands out to me and expected me to make up for it. Then getting mad at me when I said I had far too much on my plate to add another battle with thier mom, they had to handle it. Since there was no way to pay for school this semester, both have essentially become shut ins at home. I’ve had it because niether shows an iota of interest in thier future. On a lark I called my college roommate who is head ski patrol at a small resort in NM. He said I’m hired. I talked to my partner and he’d gladly buy my half of the business. With the 50% id have to give my ex wife I could live modest and comfortably for the rest of my life. I could spend my summers hiking, my winters working and maybe just not spend 15 hours a day at a desk working for 3 people who just see me as a wallet.Kids would be cut off. I wouldn’t be able to afford ANY help. They have avenues and legal recourse with thier mom, whether they take it is up to them. But they’d have to grow up and fast.Would I be the asshole if I do this?"
282,Not the A-hole,AITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?,24738,aglogu,2161,"My ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.A few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.The one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.This was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.Was I unfair to this unborn child?  Am I a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  She cheated on me, but is this a situation that I should suck it up and take care of them anyway?"

My husband work night shifts-3 nights a week so he's usually sleeping at home during the day. He got himself a ps5 a month ago. He started spending time playing. He used to handle some of the house chorus now all he does is make excuses of how tired he is and how much he needs sleep. But he'd come home from his shift and starts playing. He drinks a lot of coffee to stay concentrated and awake. Also he stopped eating properly. Keeps forgetting to do things I ask him to do. Like help fix his daughter's toys/take turns in changing diapers etc.I started calling my mom to come help since he's been too busy to do simple things. He didn't like that I asked others for help and said I didn't have to. That he'll start helping again. I actually believed him and left for my 8 hour shift at the hospital and before I left I reminded him of everything he needed to do from feeding/changing diapers/cleaning our daughter's room etc. He said ""don't worry about it"" and then I left.I called him to check on the kids and he said everything was fine. I came home in the evening and I was shocked to see our 6 months old's bed was put in the living room. Her stuff on the couch. While he was playing. She didn't stop crying he said he didn't know what was wrong. Turned out he didn't change the diaper after I left. She was wearing the same diaper for 9 hours. He said he forgot but he was busy playing. I immediately took care of her. I knew her rash was going to get worse after that. My 6 year old's hair was a mess he didn't brush her hair. The kitchen was a mess. I was livid kept yelling at him for being neglectful and reckless and literally forgetting about his own kids over a game.He said that I was overreacting and that it was my fault for not reminding him on the phone. I told him it was my fault for leaving the kids with someone who doesn't even brush his teeth. He got offended and left the house minutes later.His mom called me telling me that my husband stayes up at night to make a living for his kids and that I was pressuring him by giving him more than he could handle. I tried to explain but she kept lashing out calling me controlling and said I might be frustrated from my job that's why ""I'm taking it out on him"".I hung up on her and had to take care of all of that mess.Sorry for any mistakes I'm just so exhausted."
284,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my boyfriend he isn’t entitled to my inheritance?,24713,f2wl3j,4246,"My grandpa passed away a few months ago and I inherited a little over $4 million from his estate. I had no idea he had that much money and was honestly not expecting to receive anything, as I assumed it would all go to my mom. After I got over the initial shock, I took the opportunity to finally quit my job (which I really hated), as I don’t have any outstanding debts and can easily live off of $40,000 a year. I’m pretty introverted and am more than happy to stay at home working on art/music/other interests and gaming.Ever since I inherited the money, my boyfriend has been pressuring me to cover all of the rent and utilities (about $1200 a month) for our apartment and start putting money away into a joint savings fund. I would be happy to do this if we were married, but we’re not. We’ve only been dating for a year and a half, and I would prefer to keep our finances separate. Despite not working anymore, I still pay my half of the rent every month and have started paying for a housekeeper to come in and clean a few times a week, so our apartment is nearly always spotless and looks great. I told my boyfriend he isn’t entitled to my money and he said I was being selfish for expecting him to still contribute to the rent when I could easily afford to pay for the whole thing. AITA?"
285,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my roommate wear something she stole from me?,24674,i6hs86,1040,"Last night my roommate was about to leave for some fancy dinner she was attending at her boyfriend’s parent’s house and I noticed she was wearing my dress. I asked her if it was mine and she said yes. I asked her if she had gone into my room while I wasn’t there and taken it and she sheepishly said yes. Just to be clear, we don’t have that kind of relationship, we’re friendly but not friends, so this felt like a huge violation. I told her to take it off and find something else to wear. She began crying and said she had nothing else to wear that would work for the event. I said too bad if she had asked me first it would have been a totally different story. I’m not cool with her just taking my things without permission. She ended up having a temper tantrum and not going. Her boyfriend texted me later on and said I was an asshole. AITA here?"
286,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving my husband in the grocery store because he started acting like a toddler?,24679,jx90uv,4085,"We all go through phases and pick up annoying habits, and sometimes we just need our loved ones to gently tell us if we've picked up a particularly egregious habit.Sometime in the last year, my husband has picked up a habit where he talks like a baby. At first it was funny, but passed into embarrassing, cringeworthy behavior quickly.Examples: doggo, pupper, woofer/subwoofer, pibble, hooty-boy, peepo, birb, meowmeow, sammy, sammiches, sammywhammy, chicky nuggies, chicky tendies, adding a toddleresque ""lisp"" to words, and the ones that really get gross are childish euphemisms for genitalia or sex.I cannot emphasize this enough: it is not endearing or sexy to have my husband talk about my ""boobies"" and his ""weiner"" and ""weenie"" and ""wee wee"", ""hoohas"" and ""bajingos"" (Nostalgia for Scrubs be damned). We have not had sex for six months because he cannot stop talking about my ""boobies"" and it makes me sick.Just before the pandemic hit, we were out at a restaurant with some friends, he actually ordered a ""chicky sammy"" like, said that exact phrase. Chicky. Sammy. Look, it's totally fine that he ordered the chicken sandwich. That's not the issue. Our friends noticed the baby talk, because he insisted on continuing the ""joke"" and even started talking with this god awful toddler... lilt? Accent?After that, I just couldn't stomach the idea of going out with him to adult places. I'd go out to the brewery with friends, but god forbid he join me and say ""Me wanty 'nother beer!"" or something.I don't know where it came from. I don't know why he's doing this. I finally hit my limit when we were grocery shopping and everything seemed normal and fine until he gasped like a kid, ran to the ice cream section and jumped up and down yelling ""ICE CWEAM ICE CWEAM! I WANT CHOCWIT!""I was *MORTIFIED*. People were staring at him and me. He kept going and kept saying ""CAN WE GET POPSICOOOS?"" and I just said ""Either talk to me like an adult or I'm leaving.""He started saying OOOOOO YOU MUST BE FUN AT PARTIES and LIGHTEN UP, WILL YOU? And shit like that. I just said fuck it, and left the store, leaving him to walk home (like a mile, it was fine) because I couldn't even look at him.Since then, things have been very tense, and he keeps telling me that he wants an apology for embarrassing him by leaving him in the store. I told him that people don't get to demand apologies, if someone wants to apologize, it's up to them, and I am absolutely not going to apologize for saving myself the embarrassment of a 35 year old man with a mortgage and retirement account asking for ""CHOCWIT ICE CWEAM.""He got his fucking Mom involved, no joke. She keeps telling me it's just a phase and that he's probably bored and I should be happy this is his midlife crisis, rather than him fucking 19 year olds at the local bar.I'm going crazy. AITA? Do I really just need to let my husband continuously embarrass me like this?**Edit:** Sorry, there was only so much space. I *have* talked to him. Multiple times. Especially about the sexual comments. I've made it extremely, abundantly clear that him using terms like ""boobies"" and ""wee wee"" are absolutely *repulsive* to me, among other things he says.**INFO:** Does he have a job? Yes, and he acts completely normal as far as I know. He worked from home for a while during lockdown, and I never heard him talk like this to anyone he worked with. **Does he do it with friends?** Sometimes, and it's generally meant to annoy them or gross them out, but he stops. He has friends where they think its ""cute"" to embarrass each other. **Is this a kink/fetish?:** If so, I'm absolutely done. (Edited because it was offensive)**Has he seen a doctor?**: No, but I've asked him if he needed to talk to someone because he was acting strange, and he accused me of being stuck up and judgmental. Given that he doesn't act like this with his coworkers, or his family, and only jokes around with his friends, I'm willing to bet that this is an indication that he's trying to force this fetish on me nonconsensually, or trying to get me to leave.**Is it a tumor?**: I don't know. Like I said above, I asked him if he needed to see someone. I can't force him (even if I want to, just find out if there's any way we can salvage this), but after this post closes I will try to get him to. Maybe his sister can encourage him, even though he acts completely normal around them.**Does he have childhood trauma?:** As far as I know, and I'm relatively close to his family and would likely know, the most traumatic thing he had happen was a minor car accident when he was around 13 years old. No injuries, no death, etc. He hasn't been in a car accident in the past two years or anything like that, and I haven't, and AFAIK no one else in his family has been, etc.**I want to send you a chat instead of my comment getting lost**: Please don't. I've had a number of people repost this to make fun of me because I didn't respond the way they wanted, etc. Just comment, I can at least to respond to those and help others get an idea of what's going on."
287,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling my fiancée about a secret room in our apartment?,24659,g3keje,3192,"I recognize the title sounds a little ridiculous. The situation is less so.I was very fortunate to be in a position to buy an apartment straight out of college. It's a weird unit on a high floor of a weird building, but I've gut-renovated it and made it really nice.One aspect of my home was created just to fulfill a childhood fantasy. A secret room! It's simple— a flush mount bookcase put in the doorway. It leads to what would otherwise be a windowless very large closet or a very small room.I made it into a cute secret lair / reading nook, but with no windows... it never got used. Ended up being more long-term storage.I never told anyone about it... because it was a secret room!I kind of figured at one point I'd tell my girlfriend, Emma, but I didn't want to tell her until I had a *reason* to. (I had finished it shortly before meeting her.)I figured maybe one day if we had a kid, I could remove the bookcase and bam, we'd have plenty of space to put in a changing table setup. Or a craft-nook for her.But I largely forgot about it, except when I needed to pull something out from back there... which is rare.**Fast forward to yesterday.**Emma, now my fiancée, has been living with me in my (now our!) apartment for eight months.During this time, I've kept the secret room... *a secret.*It's not like I was thinking about it all the time. I only consciously did something sneaky maybe three times since she's moved in, to get christmas lights, a spare coffee maker, and to put away a novelty item she probably thought I threw out.And the reason I was sneaky at those times was because again, I didn't want to waste the surprise on christmas lights!We've both been working from home lately, and we aren't really able to leave very often, due to circumstances... And she jokingly announced we needed a new room to shake things up from her normal commute. (Bedroom to Living Room.)So ***of course*** I excitedly pulled open our ""built-in"" bookshelf and showed her our room!***...And she flipped out.***She is furious at me. She sees me keeping this secret as a major betrayal of trust, given that this is her home. She's acting like I cheated on her. I tried to explain I was waiting for a special moment, but... she thinks that makes it worse.I have no idea if she's being unreasonable or if I am. AITA?"
288,Not the A-hole,AITA for filling a few faux Amazon packages with my dog's shit to teach the two theiving neighborhood kids who have been stealing my packages a lesson?,24605,cl8kbt,844,"This has been going on for a few months now, ever since school let out. There are two girls in the neighborhood who are about 8-10 and the oldest about 10-13... I have a video camera outside our apartment and have caught them red-handed. The first package they stole contained puppy pee pads and garbage bags, second package contained a pair of scrubs for work and last week they got a Bluetooth speaker.  Amazon replaced all my packages and I would rather not get the police involved and their parents are real asshats that don't supervise their kids, so I decided to fill a few packages with dog shit and leave them something special to steal to hopefully teach them a lesson. I also taped notes that said "" Dear Children, Stop stealing my shit!"" in the boxes along with the turds. Some of the turds are petrified, some were juicy and wet. AITA or am I a diabolical genius?"
289,Not the A-hole,AITA for disowning my brother for abandoning a girl after getting her pregnant?,24595,e639ni,2446,"Throw away because some of my friends know my reddit account and I want to keep this as private as possible. Sorry if the answer seems obvious, but I've had so much backlash Im starting to question myself.I am f25, my brother is m22. He lives with me since he moved out of our parents house, reasons are irrelevant. I came home to find him with his buddies in my home, getting wasted. I was pissed because he never asked if he could have people over (""Im an adult OP, I can do what I want""). Apparently he and his friends were throwing a ""bullet dodged"" party. He had been seeing this girl for a bit. She texted him letting him know that she was pregnant, but planning to abort the baby. She asked if he could financially help her pay for the operation. He. Blocked. Her. I was *horrified*. Apparently he and his brilliant friends decided that she had lied about taking birth control, because ""Its impossible for women to get pregnant if they're on the pill."" ….. right. I was livid. I was completely disgusted not only by their ignorance towards birth control and safe sex, but by the fact that he would block a girl and leave her completely on her own to handle a problem that he was at least 50% responsible for. I told him, in these exact words ""pack your shit and get the fuck out"" Obviously more than this has happened in the past, but this was my breaking point. I had tried so hard to bend over backwards for my baby brother. House him when he was homeless, help him get a job, give him rides... only for him to turn out like *that*? Nope. So anyways, he and his friends stood there like they didn't think I was serious. I said again, ""all of you get the fuck out. I don't want to see any of you here again.""Here's where I'm possibly the asshole. I told him in no uncertain terms that he needed to collect his things and leave. If he was old enough to make big-boy decisions, he was old enough to find a place on his own. He straight up said no. So I lost my temper. I grabbed as much of his stuff as I could, crammed it into a suitcase, and put/threw the suitcase outside. I shouted that if he didn't leave I would call the police. Fast forward tears and begging, he was finally out. That night I got *several* messages that I was heartless for making him homeless. They pregnancy wasn't his fault because: 1) it was an accident. 2) they weren't a serious couple so he has no reason to help her. 3) she should have been more careful. I called bull, and said I would never allow someone with that sick mindset live under my roof. I said that he is not my brother and I don't want anything to do with him. My parents, my aunts, and some cousins are with me, but that leaves about 3/4 of the family against me. They think that I should support him because he is my brother, I should have given him time (he's not on the lease btw, and he was *supposed* to pay rent but often didn't), and the punishment just didn't fit the crime.so reddit, am I the asshole?EDIT: so I didn’t think this would get as much traction. I’ve already seen some comments about it, and gotten some PMs, so Im gonna address this now. I only posted this to find out if I was TA for *how I handled it*. If I am TA, fine. So be it. But I don’t care what your views on abortion are, or how you don’t think he’s responsible for her pregnancy. So please do not comment if you’re just going to tell me about how abortion is sinful.EDIT 2: I cam currently trying to track the girl down. She is an old work colleague of his, and Im trying to find his old coworkers to figure out her contact info and see if I can help in any way."
290,Not the A-hole,"AITA for not letting my niece host her wedding at my ""castle""?",24565,jskty5,2059,"28 years ago my wife and I combined our savings (most of which came from inheritance after my father's passing) and bought our ""castle"" in southern Europe. It was actually a derelict farmhouse with some land but it has a small turret so our family has always referred to it as The Castle. My wife and I decided we'd rather have a small, basic house in our home country and focus our time and resources readying The Castle for us to retire in and for our children to enjoy.It took years but around the time our eldest was born it was finally finished. It's not massive; 5 bedrooms and a small pool in the gardens but it is our paradise. We've always allowed our families and friends to use it whenever they please, and have spent every summer vacation staying there with our children.Our only stipulation when people stay there is that the master bedroom is off limits. It takes up most of the 3rd floor with the remaining bedrooms on the 2nd floor. A lot of my and my wife's belongings are in there, and it's also the room we have shared together for over twenty years. Recently my niece got engaged and held an engagement party on Zoom at the weekend. When asked what ideas they'd had so far she excitedly told me they'd actually been planning to ask us if they could hold the wedding at The Castle.I was a bit taken aback but didn't want to outright refuse. I joked it would have to be a rather small wedding since they'd struggle to fit more than 25 people in the gardens. She gushed that she'd already thought it through and they'd put up canopies in the field nearby (we don't own that land) and if all the guests stayed in hotels in the town she would arrange transport for ""us all to get to the villa"".My wife and I bit our tongues not wanting to make a fuss during their engament celebration. But later when my niece texted me to repeat what she'd said I asked her to clarify the sleeping arrangements and after some back and forth it came to light she plans to use the master bedroom as the bridal suite and for the wedding party to have the remaining rooms. My wife, children and I would have to stay elsewhere. I slept on my decision and spoke with my wife. On Sunday I responded and politely refused, saying it's too small and we aren't comfortable having anyone in our room. Both she and my sister blew up at me telling me I was ruining her wedding and she'd always dreamed of marrying at The Castle. My sister even said since I used my inheritance it's ""family property"" which is obviously ridiculous. ETA When we texted her on Sunday we offered a compromise: no master bedroom, and either get permission/insurances to use the fields, or reduce guest count to 25. We even offered to host a small rehearsal too but she rejected the offers. That is when we outright refused"
291,Not the A-hole,AITA for suing my ex and her boyfriend?,24549,kyiont,2467,"My ex and I divorced three years ago. She was cheating, but at this point I don’t care about the relationship anymore. The pending lawsuit has nothing to do with her or him, but rather their actions. My ex and I have a son 13m that we split time with 50/50. He’s a great kid that interests have changed a lot tbh as I imagine more kids/teenagers tend to do through the years. One thing my son was heavily into at some point was legos. He use to play with them all the time, and personally I think they’re a great toy for different reasons. I use to love playing them with him, and to this day I still collect boxes that I leave unopened as a collection.Well when my ex and I divorced she got with someone who loved legos more I guess? From what I know he loves making creations and building the sets in. I don’t care.. seems cool. He does one thing I think is very very weird.. He uses crazy glue so the sets can’t break or pieces can’t be lost. It seems so weird to me. The issue is, I was out of town for all of three days last week for medical reasons, and my son wanted to get his ps4 so he could play it at his moms. This isn’t out of the ordinary at all and he has a key, so he let me know he would be stopping over for it. I told him to have fun when I saw him on the entry camera. My wife’s husband was with him which was a no-no. I told him via speaker to not go in and to wait on the porch. He flinched but walked in any way. I sent my ex a text telling her to call him and tell him he’s one minute away from a cop call. He left my home with a bag in hand which I didn’t think much of because my son had his games too. Well my son texted me later that evening and said he didn’t know it at the time but he’s pretty sure SD took some of my sets. These are all old sets and two are worth big money. When I got home I confirmed the missing sets and called my ex. She had no idea but he admired he took them but it was so son could have the sets to complete his collection... my son doesn’t even like legos anymore and told his mom he wouldn’t steal from me. My wife asked how much it would cost to replace them and unfortunately it’s more than their savings. Actually, it would take their house down payment plus more. I told them if they didn’t pay in two weeks I was suing and pressing charges. The price in the sets makes it a felony. My ex and her husband are saving for a house which would give my son more space when he’s there, but those sets were going help pay for his education someday or a home of his own. I filed the police report and have talked to a lawyer and we’re moving forward with the suit.Everyone is calling me a joke because they are just toys, but I don’t get it. They are worth real money.. I’m not rich guys. I needed those to help with my sons future... but again taking this money does deny my son things at his moms house.AITA here??Edit* I’ve been asked to add these facts.The sets have been opened which more than half their worth, and one was glued together. The damage was done already. The stolen items are: Kings Castle  Milk truck Lego land train CarouselAnd the glued one was a Star Wars snow speeder.Some of these are one piece of a larger set. So if you lose one of five, you lose the value of one produce plus the value of the set as a whole.Second edit*Ex wife and boyfriend are the same as ex boyfriend.. I’m just a bad writer.Third/final edit for this post*I know I haven’t been here much but I have read many of your comments and taken them to heart. I know my spelling is poor guys, and I apologize for the format. Calling me names in my private message was not called for, and I am not a scalper. I enjoy buying these sets and do not intend to sell all of them, but I want my son to go to college and not worry about debt, so I want to sell the ones that I can to help. I never had the smarts for higher education but my son is not me, and I love him and want him to do better. Around 4:00 PM I called the local state police and met at their facility. I gave them all I had and gave my statement. My son is with me starting tonight so when I picked him up I sent him into GameStop and called his mom. I told her I had filed charges and I asked the cop to call me when everything was done so I could give him the opportunity to turn himself in. I wanted to be better than he treated me. I’ll save her reaction for a real update btw—- can someone please tell me how to update because I don’t really understand the steps in the main notes. I told my son when we got home what I did and why.My son said that I did the right thing because he didn’t want his step dad to think it was ok to do it again, and if he didn’t go to jail he’d rather be her away from him so it isn’t weird."
292,Not the A-hole,AITA for being topless at home?,24532,ewudks,2279,"I have a son (4 months old), I'm breastfeeding, he's forever spitting up on me, and we're trying to give as much skin to skin contact as possible. Because of this, I've pretty much stopped wearing clothes at home. I'll wear them when I go out, obviously, but in the privacy of mine and my boyfriend's flat I just go bare chested. My in laws were meant to come by around 6pm, and instead came by over an hour early and let themselves in with the spare key. I was sleeping on the sofa with my son on my chest, they got an eyeful. I woke up to them yelling at me to put a shirt on and asking why I didn't do that sooner if I knew they'd be over today. I maintain that they were a full hour early and why on earth would they just let themselves in when I didn't answer the door. My boyfriend wants me to apologise, I refuse. Who's the arsehole here?Edit: to everyone commenting about the sleeping situation as being a risk of suffocation/SIDS please know that I am fully aware of this and am taking all measures to avoid any injury/death of my child, this was a one off event after he fell asleep on top of me and we napped for less than an hour, probably closer to half an hour. I appreciate the concern but this is the only time it's happened and it won't be happening again.&#x200B;Update: I am aware of how the votes on here are shaping up but they are the only people I have close by rn. My boyfriend is mad at me for making things awkward, and my in laws are annoyed by what they saw, so I just called them and apologised. Going forward I will assume they will be early and not nap/be shirtless on days they are coming in case they arrive ahead of time."
293,Not the A-hole,"AITA for giving my son ~$15,000 when he turned 18 and moved out, but refuse to give the same amount to my daughter?",24522,c13jmx,3493,"My 19-year old daughter Vanessa called me this morning and told that her girlfriend proposed to her, and wants her to move to her apartment. Now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they’ve never don’t ever SEE each other besides a few quick weekend visits. Moreover, they’ve only dated for a little more than a year. I told her I was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. But I maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.The problem lies when Vanessa asked me for money. You see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, I decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn’t have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). That combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn’t have to work at all during the school year. Since I gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. I told Vanessa that I was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.She now says that she’s moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. Her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in IT). She said that now she’s not going to school, she’d rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.I told her I cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. If/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she’s married, I’ll be happy to contribute the money. But it’s not just a free handout.She’s got really mad that I rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. To her credit, her brother and I have a closer relationship (he’s always been the studious rule-follower while Vanessa was more the troublemaker), but I do love my children equally. I told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fiancé, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. That if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, I will fully support it financially.Well we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. My wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but I told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and I rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and WHEN she has to move back home. I don’t want her to think I support this decision.She told me she sorta saw my point, but she’s not going to help me unravel this mess with my Vanessa, she’s staying out of it. I, on the other hand, think she’s acting like a spoiled brat. AITA for sticking to my guns on this?"
294,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to train with a Nazi?,24494,jkzyqj,612,"So I practice BJJ for a couple of years, mostly attendings classes that require a Gi. This means that our bodies are pretty much covered (this is important).A new dude has joined our gym recently - I saw him in a class but did not roll with him. Last week I attended a no Gi class and the coach pairs me up with new guy. New guy wears a sleeveless rash guard, lots of tattoos on both arms and legs. I look at this tattoos and there is a big black swastika on his arm. As I take a closer look there is also the SS symbol - the one that looks like thunder bolts. Some other symbols here and there as well like the Celtic Cross.I tell my coach that I want to be paired up with someone else. Coach finds me a new partner but after the class asks me what is wrong. I tell him that the guy has lots of Nazi tattoos and I don't roll with Nazis. Now the coach is mad at me for bringing politics into the gym. I told my coach that he is bringing politics into the gym by allowing a guy to walk around with a swastika on his arm. Some guys from the class are behind me, some think I am making a big deal out of it AITA for refusing to roll with a Nazi?Edit for clarification: Not in the USA. Where I come from (Europe) there are still Nazi sympathisers - a minority but a vocal minority. Also you can easily roll with a long sleeved rash guard, the climate here allows it no need for no sleeves."
295,Not the A-hole,AITA for serving vegan food at my wedding?,24400,k0nuyg,2976,"My fiance and I are getting married in June next year. We're both vegans, and although we don't judge those who are not vegan, we wanted to serve vegan food at our wedding. We found a vegan caterer.When we sent out invitations, we added a note saying that the food will be vegan. We also asked that everyone who has any specific dietary requirements let us know. The note made it clear that anyone who needed a specific diet would be catered for. Soon after the invitations went out, my aunt phoned us in a huff. My uncle does not want vegan food; he needs to eat meat, she said. I asked what his dietary requirements are, thinking that he has a specific medical condition and cannot eat a vegan meal. She said his reasons are ""cultural"" and he must eat meat. I said that's not really a good enough reason, we all come from the same culture and it's not like it's a sin to not eat meat with every single meal. I explained to her that I wouldn't really mind him eating meat but 1) it means I'll have to bring in a new caterer for one meal, which will be expensive and 2) I don't want to pay for meat if I don't have to. Again, I'm not judging non-vegans, but it doesn't sit right with me. Weeks went by. The only people who had dietary requirements were three cousins, who eat a low-carb diet. My vegan caterer came up with vegan, low-carb meals, and my cousins were happy with this plan. Upon hearing this, my aunt phoned me again, angrier this time, asking why my uncle can't be catered for because he ""doesn't like"" vegan food.I refused again. I told her that the food consists of things I KNOW he eats anyway: vegetables, coconut, nuts, etc. I went through a list of ingredients I knew would be in the food and she admitted he has no intolerances/allergies to any of that stuff. What's the big deal with him skipping meat one time? I told her that if he's so adamant about the meat he can buy himself McDonalds and eat it at the kiddy table.Now my aunt isn't talking to me, and is instead talking shit about me to all my family members. I told her that they are welcome to simply not attend the wedding if they're going to bitch about the food.I understand that veganism is not possible or sustainable for many people in the long-term but come on - it's ONE meal, that is FREE. AITA? I don't want to seem like a ""pushy vegan"" but I also don't want to pay for meat unless I have to. Again, it's one meal out of their whole life."
296,Not the A-hole,AITA for cutting off my hearing so I don’t have to listen to a family member.,24386,i7gwu8,983,"I (15F) am deaf in both ears after getting meningitis as a toddler. Luckily my parents really pushed intervention, so I can read lips, know sign language and have cochlear implants, so I’m basically like any other girl my age. I just can’t hear for shit.My aunt (40) has been staying with my family-that’s me, my mom, my dad and my 13 year old sister- during quarantine. She is REALLY not someone I like. She critiques every little thing my sister and I do, tells us we need to eat more (or less, depending on the day, even though we’re skinny), butts in to our personal conversation and just is snoopy in general. She tries to instigate fights between us- like asking my sister if she’s mad I have something she doesn’t. It’s also important to know she’s done nothing to learn about communicating with me. I’d say about 90% of the rest of my extended family knows sign language. We’ve told our parents about it a million times, and they’ve talked to her. I don’t think they’ve given her an ultimatum, so my sister and I devised a plan. For the past few days whenever my aunt starts talking, I just detach my hearing aids and my sister puts in her airpods and turns up the volume. We can understand each other fine. My aunt didn’t get it the first couple of times but I think today she understood we were ignoring her and got really upset. She told my dad, and from what I understand, he basically told her she needs to lay off if she’s bothering us that bad or she can leave. I was happy to hear that, tbhz I heard (lol) her crying later though, and that made me feel like *shit*. I never meant to make someone cry and now I kinda regret the whole thing. Are my sister and I assholes for going to such extreme measures? We just wanted her to leave us alone, or at least be nice to us.EDIT: Wow I went to sleep and look what I woke up too! Thanks for all the nice comments and stuff! Here’s a few things I wanted to point out.I have good hearing with the implants in. Without them in,  I will only hear some thing VERY loud right next to my ear (like if someone claps into it). Doctors typically rate it on a scale- I am severely deaf. Cochlear implants have two parts- external and internal. The external connects to the internal with a magnet. It comes off like you would take off a magnet on your fridge. I CAN switch it off, but I thought the message would get across better if I yanked it off my head. I wish I could answer everyone who’s PM’d me or left comments about the implants. I think unfortunately that’s something for your doctor- everyone is different. I agree aunt doesn’t need to learn sign language. However- because I was in early intervention and then speech therapy for most of my childhood, I have a more “normal” speaking voice and so she says I should talk. It’s a bit nasally sounding to me and I prefer to sign. Aunt likes to move out of my line of sight and that forces me to speak and makes me feel bad. Also, yes my little sister is amazing. Thanks for all the nice comments about her. She’s my best friend and I love her so much. We decided to be nice to aunt today and see what happens. Talk atcha later!"
297,Not the A-hole,AITA for leaving a repairman a bad review for flirting with my wife?,24376,i26ptx,2829,"The air conditioner broke last week while I was out of town and my wife had to call an emergency technician in the middle of the night. A company we’d used before without issues sent a guy over. He fixed the air conditioner no problem, but once he’d left I woke up to a million missed texts and calls from my wife, who was hysterical. Apparently within minutes of showing up he made comments about her body and other suggestive statements. She made it clear she wasn’t interested without being outright rude because she didn’t want him to get mad and leave without fixing the air conditioner. The tech kept trying to put moves on her, then after he’d fixed the A/C, he didn’t leave right away, trying to feed her some lines about how she seemed to be home alone and he could “spend the night to make sure she was safe.” Eventually he realized he was driving down a dead end and left, but the whole thing just really freaked her out, having some guy in the house who didn’t leave when asked and everything. I was pissed to hear about all this, and she was shaken up by the incident, so we left a review on their Google and Yelp pages saying what had happened. The company is pretty small so the owner called me to apologize a couple days later and said the tech had had a few drinks that night, not expecting to be called out to an emergency job, and that “his sense of humor had clearly been misinterpreted” by my wife. He asked me to take my review down because it called the tech out by first name and apparently a review saying he was coming onto a female customer could cause some personal problems for the guy. The owner also reasoned that the business was an air conditioner repair business, not a bedside manner business, and that they did fix the air conditioner, so deserved a higher rating. I told them our review stands, and they basically said we were assholes for threatening the reputation of their business and the personal reputation of the tech over a single misunderstanding. On the one hand, they did fix the air conditioner, and that’s what we called them to do. On the other hand, I feel like this is relevant information for people considering hiring them, even if it was a one time thing. AITA?"
298,Not the A-hole,AITA for not giving my brother(and wife) the bigger room?,24375,jeujp5,2702,"My brother’s wife lost her job. Which has caused them to lose the house they were renting. My brother asked if he could stay with me. I talked to my bf and he said sure. So, I told my brother yes, *BUT* he can’t bring any of their furniture with them. We don’t have any room for any of it. Our spare room has a bed and dressers in it already. He’ll have to find a place to store their things. He wasn’t happy about it, but said okay and that was that.When they started moving their clothes and whatnot in, they started complaining about how small the room was. I ignored it, because they were used to a rather large house. And I was sympathetic, because I know how it feels to go from having everything to nothing. I apologized and told them that this was the best we had. Issue:My son was in his room, and started crying. I went in there to check on him, and my brother got MAD. I usually keep his door closed when he’s napping(I have a baby monitor) and I guess my brother saw how ‘large’ his room is. It’s not big, at all. By any means. It’s just bigger than the spare room. He asked “why the hell” we gave him the small room when we can just move our son into the spare room. I told him I’m not moving my son and all his things into a different room when the spare bedroom is perfectly fine for the two of them as long as they don’t try to move their entire house into one room. He got mad. She got mad. They threw a fit. Then my brother asked why we don’t move my son into our room. I told him that my son’s crib won’t fit in our room. And again, I’m not moving him just to to accommodate them. The last week or so has been very...tense. Small comments here. Cold shoulder there. Petty shoulder checks from his wife if we cross close together. I’ve kept my mouth shut, because I love my brother, and I don’t want to cause trouble. Plus, if they weren’t so pissy(I guess is the word) they wouldn’t be hard to live with. They’ve started to complain that my son’s crying at night is keeping them awake. Which, I get, but he’s a baby. He only wakes once a night to eat. And that’s not even all the time. This morning it all came to a head when my brother told me I should move into the spare room and let them have mine and my boyfriend’s room so that they don’t get woke up by the baby. When I told him no, he started yelling. Calling me selfish and entitled. Told me that I should let them have my room, because my son is “an annoying little shit that keeps them up every night, all night.”Where I may be the asshole:I saw red. Let me start this by saying I did NOT yell at my brother as he yelled at me. I said “If you can’t appreciate the room you were given, you can go elsewhere. My boyfriend and I have been more than accommodating to you. You constantly complain. You’re ungrateful and rude. Get over yourself or get out of my house.”ETA: I’m asking if I’m TA because my mother called and told me I’m an asshole for not giving the married couple the big bedroom with the connected bathroom. And apparently my other siblings agree?ETA2: They do not pay rent. My boyfriend and I own our home and don’t pay anything on it. They pay the difference on the electricity bill and buy some of their own groceries. I do the majority of the cooking and all the cleaning.ETA3: Boyfriend and I are going to talk about kicking them out tonight when he gets off work.ETA4: I will update y’all tomorrow 😂"
299,Not the A-hole,AITA for not paying for the extra meal I accidentally ordered at a wedding?,24362,d2cd5s,2562,"My sixteen year old son and I went to a wedding. When we got the invitation, we both chose to order chicken for the main course. There was an option to select a kid's meal version of each dish, but I never considered ordering one for my son because he is too old for kid's meals. I sent in the RSVP card with our meal selections and never heard anything about it.At the wedding, my son and I got our food, but the table was one chicken meal short. The waiter had a small plate of chicken fingers and fries, but everyone at the table told him it must be a mistake because we didn't have any kids sitting with us. The waiters were able to put together an extra chicken plate for the person who didn't get one, and it seemed all was well.I later got a call from the bride's parents, who told me that the chicken fingers had been for my son, and that I had caused the caterer to charge them for the extra adult chicken meal. I told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. They said I should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that I should have asked for clarification if I wasn't sure. But I wasn't unsure, I never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal. Ten and under I would think would have kid's meals and eleven to thirteen is questionable, but fourteen and up I would never think would have a kid's meal. The bride's parents told me it's normal for anyone under eighteen to get a kid's meal, but I've never heard of eighteen being the cutoff. I think it's rude to feed a sixteen year old a meal meant for a six year old. WIBTA if I refused to pay for the extra meal and told them it was their mistake for changing my son's order? I know wedding meals are expensive, but I think this was their mistake."
300,Not the A-hole,AITA I lied about having a college fund for my step sister to save my sister,24339,igywqa,1035,"I am 32F. I grew up with a narcissistic mom. I have never met my dad. The first hug I have received in my life was at 10 years old when Dan (my mom's BF) hugged me when I thanked him for a gift. My mom had my sister a year later. My sister was the perfect baby sister anyone could ask for. Mom and Dan split and at first mom had major custody of my sister. Mom did the same thing to my sister she did to me, doesn't even acknowledge us in the room if she was not in the mood, not feeding us dinner if we made a mistake, made everything our fault. When Dan found out, he applied for full custody for my sister but my mother fought and somehow wrangled 50% of custody.&#x200B;Things got real bad for me and the only silver lining was my sister. Despite being only 4 years old, she would sneak in snacks from her dad for me to eat. Anything Dan bought for her, he also bought me. He wasn't wealthy by any means but it was the small things and anytime he dropped my sister, he will take his time to talk to me. He was the only father I have ever known. Dan died of cancer when I was 16 and my sister 5. He lived only 3 months from the diagnosis but settled everything financially as able as he can for my sister. He split his assets 75% for my sister and 25% for me to be given to me when I reached 18. Knowing my mom very well, he made me the executor of my sister's fund too. To say my mom was furious was an understatement. She literally made the next 2 years of my life and my sister a living hell.&#x200B;When my mom started dating Brad, he already had a daughter 3 years younger than my sister. My mom had made it absolutely clear that my sister will be allowed to go to college only if she shares her trust fund with our stepsister. Brad is a piece of work and me and my sister never really bonded with our stepsister. She refused to sign anything related to my sister's education unless I give her my word that I will give my step sister equal half of the trust fund. This is where I think I was the asshole. I held the trust fund above my mom's head to treat my sister fairly. I repeatedly told them I will give my step sister half the fund until my sister was 18 and moved to college.  Once she moved out, we both cut any contact we had with our mom and blocked her. I made my sister give her the wrong college info, so our mom couldn't contact her.&#x200B;I have found out through few friends my mom didn't know I have that my step sister couldn't get into any college because she didn't want to apply any loans and she is very depressed. I know I misled them, but I honestly wanted my sister to be safe.&#x200B;AITA for causing my step sister's depression and robbing her of college&#x200B;Edit: Thank you everyone for your reassurance. I showed this post to my sister and the only thing she had to say was ""Duh"". We both have discussed and decided to not contact our step sister. We were never close to her and my friends back there can't safely get any message to her without dragging our mom into it which is the last thing we both want.&#x200B;All these awards, thank you all again and the kind stranger who gave me gold."
301,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my friend that she is only welcome at my house if she doesn't bring her husband,24344,ifavsp,1780,I know the title sounds bad please hear me outSo I have severe epilepsy and have a service dog Onyx. Now Onyx does have time to cuddle and relax and be at rest and just be a dog. But when he is working he is WORKING at keeping me alive. He's saved my life multiple timesNow my friend has been coming over a lot recently to visit. I love her but have an issue with her husband. He's one of those types who harbors the believe that have a dick makes him superior to women. He also doesn't believe in invisible disabilities and because of Onyx he's never seen me have a seizure.Last week they came over and her husband was being playful with Onyx which was fine as he was at rest. A little while later though the husband began asking if he could dogsit sometime bring Onyx to their place for a sleepover. I said no and explained AGAIN that Onyx is a service dog and I needed him to ya know...... Stay alive. Her husband got an attitude and told me Onyx wasn't a machine and I had no right to deprive him of fun. Then he pulled the I'm a man so I know more than you card by explaining that I was wrong and he was right and I could go one night without onyx and control my seizures. All this time my friend sat on the couch saying nothing. I asked him to leave and after some huffing and puffing about how rude I am and what happened to manners and Onyx would've had fun they both did.Now today my friend called asking if they could stop by. I explained that I would love to have her over but her husband was no longer welcome. She got upset and told me that he was just like that and it was hard to tell sometimes because he had never seen me have a full blown seizure. I got kinda mad and sarcastically asked her if I should purposely cause a seizure so her husband was comfortable. She just kept repeating that he meant no harm and wanted Onyx to have fun. I just told her again that she is welcome but he is not.AITA. I feel awful and feel like I'm creating an issue but that man is just toxic energy and I worry that his disbelief of my need for a service animal will cause him to do something completely crazy.Edit. I had to work with Onyx for two weeks at a training center before I could even bring him home so he knew exactly how to help me i.e read my body and triggers and so we worked together and we're completely in synch. He's extremely well trained and I feel like that might have something to do with this.
302,Not the A-hole,AITA fot kicking out my daughter after she tried to send my cat to the shelter?,24335,hg83en,2861,"Throw away for obvious reasons. TLDR at the end.&#x200B;the relevant backstory: I have two daughters, one is 21 and in college, the other is 26 and because of a lot of factors finds herself pregnant, divorcing her husband and needing to live in our house for the foreseeable future and I am happily married to their mother.  The other notable character is my cat Lieutenant (we call her Leut). I found Leut in a dumpster almost ten years ago when she was only a week old, got her to the vet and she has been my best buddy for the last decade. She is now my grumpy old little shadow whenever i'm home.&#x200B;so yesterday I came home from work and I hear my eldest daughter calling me from the kitchen. my wife and eldest then tell me that ""Leut is getting old dad, and with the baby coming we didn't think it was safe to keep an old grouchy cat around an infant. So we made the decision today to send Leut to a shelter so that she can find a family that is more in line with what she needs.""&#x200B;I told them both they were WAY out of line (not in so many words) and we would talk when we get back. I drive to the closest shelter, fine Leut, prove ownership, pay the $100 fee to get her back, and take her home.&#x200B;So here is the drama part: When I get home I call a family meeting and tell my eldest she doesn't get to make decisions about my pets without consulting me, Leut only wants to be left alone and even if it came to it i would rather exhaust all my options before putting Leut through life at a shelter. My eldest began arguing with me that Leut would be a liability around an infant and she is unpredictable (untrue, she is either asleep, sitting on her cat tree or eating). At that point i saw red and told her my cat is well trained, and dared her to come up with one instance of Leut even scratching someone, which she couldn't but kept insisting that old cats are inherently dangerous for kids. I then told herthat she had one month to get a new place to live as she clearly doesn't respect me or my things, and that if Leut so much as lost a whisker, I would hold her personally responsible.&#x200B;My wife and younger daughter are now begging me to change my mind as with my eldest's current financial condition i would probably be condemning her to homelessness, and that my daughter should come before a cat.AITA for kicking my daughter out after she tried to get rid of my cat?TLDR: eldest daughter decided to send my elderly cat to a shelter over fears she would harm her baby when the child is born. I kicked her out. AITA?Edit to add:As many people have brought up, no i am not being as hard on my wife as my daughter. My wife came up to me last night and basically begged for forgiveness, saying she wasn't thinking and just accepted the things my daughter was saying without checking  (very out of character for her). So I have told her i will need some space for the foreseeable future but that she and I are ok.&#x200B;Leut is already microcipped and wears a collar and tag. I have also contacted all the shelters around my area and sent them Leut's picture chip ID and my contact information and an explanation that i am worried someone may surrender my cat without my permission."
303,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my daughter the truth about why I wasn’t in her life?,24310,ln04z1,2172,"To start, my ex and I were 19 when she got pregnant. We had recently broke up and she found out a couple weeks later that she was pregnant. She said she planned to get an abortion but only wanted her sister there.So I was always under the belief that she had aborted. She only contacted me once saying it was done and we didn’t speak again. Fast forward 19 yrs later, I found out a month ago that was a lie. My ex passed away 3 years ago and my daughter Kara has been living with her uncle. He was the one to reach out to give me a heads up after she expressed an interest in wanting us to connect. He and I spoke at length because I was feeling some pretty strong emotions like rage for never being told about her. My ex had backed out of the abortion but didn’t want me involved because we were broken up so decided just not to tell me. But he told me that Kara doesn’t know about that. Apparently I wasn’t ready for fatherhood because we were both young so I bailed. I couldn’t believe it. Rob (her uncle) told me he knows his sister was wrong for that but promised Kara doesn’t have any negative feelings towards me and my ex never painted me as some villain, just a young guy who knew he couldn’t properly care for her. He asked me not to tell Kara this when we talk if she asks and because it could hurt the way she saw her mom. I never actually confirmed I would.Kara messaged me and we’ve been talking. I’ve met her twice and it’s been crazy emotional. Looking at this girl who looks just like me and hurting that we’re just barely getting to know each otherSo far our conversations have only been about what her life was like, how my life is, what her wants/future goals are, and getting to know each other.We met again Tuesday and she finally decided to ask the obvious questions about what made me not be involved. How did I feel, what went through my mind, did I ever think about her,etc.I had been thinking about what to do but in that moment I just didn’t have it in me to lie so I was honest. That I was told about the abortion, had no idea she even existed until now, but that I still really want to be in her life and have the chance to be her father if she wants that. Kara was a bit emotional, we talked some more, and said she still wants me involved.That night my messages were blowing up. Not just from rob but her grandparents as well. They’re all outraged for telling Kara about her mom because she yelled at all of them and is refusing to even take their calls. Yes, the lie was terrible but I just ruined the image she had of her late mother for my own benefit. Rob called me a selfish dick for not taking into consideration how this would affect Kara finding out about this.So right now I feel like shit. I get “honesty is the best policy” but in this case I don’t know if I was an asshole for doing it. I’m still learning this whole “dad” business so don’t know if I dropped the ball here."
304,Not the A-hole,AITA For not giving my wife her daughter's address so she could see the newborn?,24283,ku4ppq,1958,"Hear me out please. I'm a 46 year-old father who lost a daughter (Molly) years ago to Brain Cancer. Molly's death broke me. She was my only child I'm no longer who I was before this tragedy. I married my wife when my stepdaughter (Sarah) was 15. Sarah had issues with her mom. Her mom would kick her out over small arguments. She kicked her out for getting a haircut, for failing one class and other reasons. Every time she'd bring her back home and tell her to learn her lesson or she'd be kicked out. One time her mom kicked her out over a dairy at 17 and Sarah had enough and didn't return. She started working. I remained in contact. I just couldn't let her struggle I tried to help her financially but she refused. she's incredibly independent and a hard working person. She reminded me of Molly. I decided to help in other ways. I got her a better job opportunity by calling someone I knew at the time. This way she still had to work to earn money which is something she wanted. And also work a better job that appreciated her more than the previous job. She's an artist, she wanted to be a graphic designerI sold my old car to pay for her courses. She started paying me back bit by bit only because she's independent. She lived with her then boyfriend now husband and paid for other things.My wife didn't try to mend things. She disowned Sarah the day she got married but I stood firm and told her that I'm free to talk to Sarah and she should respect that.I attend gatherings with Sarah from time to time and she calls me dad infront of other people. In the past it was just my name.This sounds crazy but I believe this all happened just so I could meet Sarah and have a chance at being the best father that I could be.She's now 22 and just had a babygirl a few weeks ago. I visited several times and we talked. She told me that it was unfortunate that she lost her dad but was glad she has me in her life. I cried although I'm not good at expressing emotions and it got worse after Molly's death.My wife knew about the baby and demanded I give her the address so she could go see her granddaughter. I refused because Sarah asked me not to tell. And because she's already dealing with postpartum and will not be able to deal with her mom's behavior. My wife threw a fit and said that this is her daughter and grandbaby and I shouldn't try to stop her from seeing her. She called me selfish and cruel. The argument didn't stop. The family are agreeing with her and telling me to stay out of it. I argued with my wife about it again. And she said I had no right and that I needed to give her the address. She didn't even seem regretful or wanted to apologize. Everyone is blaming me telling I'm being cruel and demanding I give her the address."
305,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my family to stop celebrating?,24258,hugvzj,1426,"6 years ago I met the best person in the world. She was a sweet old lady that moved in next door, named Maggie. Maggie taught me how to knit, we watch Mamas family together, i helped her give her cat her medicine, I helped water her plants when she got to frail to do it herself. She knitted me a hat for every holiday., I helped her install WiFi. Maggie was a nurse in WWII.Maggie passed away 3 months ago at the age of 94. She went peacefully in her sleep, and it is the heartbreak of my life. About two weeks after she died, I noticed a man walking into Maggie’s house. Maggie didn’t have any family except for a nephew, who lived across the country. I went up to him and asked who he was, and he said he was going to clean out his aunts things.That was the end of that until yesterday. Maggie’s nephew had rung my doorbell, and had told me that Maggie left me most everything she had in her will. Maggie left me 1 million dollars in a account I can open when I turn 18, most of her personal effects, and her cat, blue. Who I rescued two days after she died and kept. She wrote me and her nephew letters. she said some stuff I would rather not share. It tore me up about Maggie even more. She was such a gentle soul and she deserved better. I started crying, and I told my parents. They started celebrating about  it immediately. I asked them to stop. And they did, until today they presented me with a cake, that said “hey, you get to go to college!”. To say that it made me upset is a understatement. I get that Maggie’s money is a life changing thing, but I would much rather have Maggie. I told them to stop celebrating then I went to my room to hold blue and cry. My brother knocked on my door and told me I was being a asshole because our parents are just happy for me. AITA?"
306,Not the A-hole,AITA for making a girl cry by calling her fat when she was roasting me for being skinny?,24248,ad9ycy,2554,"Context: So a couple of girls in my college friend group have a roommate called “Jan”. I am acquainted with her and we never really had any problems, we actually made quite a good beer pong duo. I’m a tall and lanky male at 6’1 and 155lbs. Jan is a white chick on the heavier-side.Recently, we had a watch party at Jan’s apartment for the Michigan Football Bowl Game where our friends were all having a good time getting pretty tipsy. My buddy and I were talking about whether our QB should declare for the draft or return. I said “I sure hope he comes back, Dylan (our backup QB) is still young and is still pretty scrawny.” Jan has a huge crush on Dylan and didn’t appreciate that I called him skinny. This caused her to go on a drunken tirade saying “what makes you think that you can call him skinny when you’re literally built of twigs?” “You would die playing football. Tbh I don’t think you could even lift a helmet!” At first, I took it on the chin, had a chuckle about it, and poked back a bit. I usually got my leg pulled about my physique but I never took it personally. Until she started making it personal.“Look at you, you’re like one of those starving African kids on those TV commercials”  (I’m brown but not African)“That’s why Dylan is a chick-magnet and [my ex] dumped you. You look malnourished”She kept going and now I was beginning to boil. I wasn’t even responding at this point, just biting my tongue. But then I snapped.Her: “Go lift some weights. It’s okay no one will judge you if you can only curl 5 pounds.”Me: “If you could tell me what your current diet is, I’m sure I’ll put on weight in no time.”*silence*Her: “What are you trying to say?”Me: “I’m saying that if I’m a malnourished African then you could be on The Biggest Loser. And I’m pretty certain you wouldn’t win.”Her: “No wonder [ex] didn’t want you. Go fuck yourself.”Me: “And no guy wants you. The last dick you got was Moby Dick. Fucking whale.”At this point she was in tears, make-up running and everything. Her chick friends helped her into a bedroom to comfort her while looking back at me with a death glare.Since this was at Jan’s place, I figured I should leave (Michigan was getting slaughtered at this point anyways). I finished my beer and left. I got a FaceTime from one of my friends who is Jan’s roommate. She urged me to apologize because she was just playing around and I went too far. I didn’t feel that way and I don’t want to apologize.Am I the Asshole?EDIT: grammarINFO: we were both drunk but I’m pretty certain she had drank more than me EDIT: woah! thanks for platinum and silver you beautiful bastards! 🤯INFO: I was drunk so the real argument obviously had a few stumbles and slurred words.

307,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to give my parents money?,24236,hfkctd,2696,"I’m a 19 year old F with six older siblings. My parents spent most of my childhood spending money they didn’t have on my siblings, so by the time I hit my teenage years, I realized I was probably going to have to fend for myself financially when I turn 18. I started babysitting and doing odd jobs around my neighborhood when I was 14, and eventually got part-time jobs during the school year. By the time I was 16, I was working three jobs in the summer and two in addition to school. When my parents told me they couldn’t pay for college, I’d already earned enough (along with scholarships) to be able to put myself through college and have plenty left over. I’ve continued to work during the school year, and have been able to make money during quarantine by tutoring online. The issue began a few months ago, when my eldest sister (29F) got married. My parents spent 30 grand on her wedding, taking out a second mortgage to do so. To make matters worse, my dad was furloughed 6 days after the wedding. They’d effectively dug themselves into a hole they couldn’t get out of. Two weeks ago, my mom texted me for the first time since the wedding. She didn’t say hi, ask how I was, or make any small talk. She just said “Your dad and I need a favor. When can we call you?” I’d expected this. None of my elder siblings are doing well financially, and they’ve exhausted all other loan options, both from family and the bank. I figured they would text me, ask me to loan them a few thousand, and promise to pay it back when they could figure things out. I was absolutely willing to pitch in a few thousand, and had even considered giving them some of my tutoring jobs so they could make some extra cash. I was not, however, expecting them to demand I GIVE them all the money (close to $40,000) I’d made from the ages of 14-18. The exact statement my mom had made was “You made that money under our roof. We were the ones who allowed you to work, so you only have it because of us anyway...We bought you food and clothes for 18 years. That money is only a fraction of what you owe us...” and so on.I said that food, clothes, and shelter were the very minimum, it’s what they signed up for when they chose to become parents, I didn’t ask for any of it, etc. They responded by telling me that if it wasn’t for them, I wouldn’t have the life I have today. I said they were being ridiculous, and hung up. Since that day, both (along with two of my siblings) have continuously hounded me about giving them what is “rightfully theirs.” My siblings, who have never been asked to give them money, are still professing that it’s my job as their kid to take care of them. I told them they wouldn’t see a cent of my hard-earned money, and have no right to make such a request.I’m torn. I feel awful for refusing to help them out, but on the other hand, this was their fault. I feel I shouldn’t be responsible for fixing their mess. AITA?"
308,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to name our daughter Karen?,24231,jfdbk3,1527,"My wife and I recently found out we’re having a daughter. We hadn’t really talked about names before but we both agreed that each of us will retain veto power. When we did start discussing names, both of us wanted to name her after our late mothers. Her mom’s name was Karen and my mom’s name wasn’t a meme. I told her the baby can take my mom’s name as her first name and her mom’s name as a middle name, or have an entirely different name, but I can’t okay “Karen” as a first name in any case. She got offended because she just wants to honor her mother and thinks I have a problem with that. I just don’t want to set our daughter up to be bullied throughout her life. I told her I’d be fine with whatever first name she picks as long as it doesn’t lead to the baby being picked on later in life, but she’s pretty insistent on Karen.Edit: Wow, I didn’t expect this to blow up. I thought I’d delete this since this issue is pretty much resolved now but you guys are clearly enjoying this, so I thought I’d provide an update. We had a talk about this and why she had such an emotional reaction to my veto. Ever since her mom died suddenly when she was only fourteen, she’s wanted to name her first daughter after her and she didn’t really ever consider that the meme might be a potential obstacle. By that point, I’d thought about it for a while and realized that, as many of the comments have pointed out, Karen likely won’t be a meme by the time she’s old enough to feel its impact. So I told her I’ll recant my veto but we should still reconsider it because it still has potential complications and we might just come up with a better tribute. While exchanging ideas, we realized that both our mothers very coincidentally had the exact same middle name, Elizabeth (well mine had two middle names, and Elizabeth was one of them, but still). It seemed completely perfect to both of us so we’re going with it. Thanks for all your inputs!"
309,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling a friend's bf her intentions of getting pregnant?,24220,i2h8u6,1663,"A couple years ago, a close friend, Ashley, started a long-distance relationship with a guy, Chris. He has been really good to her and after meeting in person a few times, they decided to move in together. I was super happy for her as she had a few bad relationships over the years and it was nice to see her in a healthy one. That joy faded the last couple months before she moved a few states over to be with him.&#x200B;The issue isn't her moving, but that she repeatedly joked about having a baby from Chris. At first, I accepted it as jokes, but over time I realized Ashley was serious.&#x200B;For context, Ashley has two children from a previous previous relationship, ages 10 and 12. Chris absolutely doesn't want kids. He told her this at the start and anytime she hinted possibly wanting more, he shot it down, saying it was a deal breaker. Now, Chris is more than willing to accept her children as her own, because he loves her and after meeting her kids, them as well. He's accepted that they are a package deal with her, and since they are at an age where they are semi-independent, it's not an issue for him.&#x200B;To me, Chris is a real bro for taking on her kids without issue. Hearing Ashley say she wants a baby out of him, ""one way or another"", bothered me to no end. It's hard enough to find a partner that treats you well and accepts children that aren't their own. To find one that does and then talk about plotting to force a baby seems gross and manipulative.&#x200B;Before her move, I had sat down with Ashley, trying to talk sense into her. At first she resisted, but finally it seemed she understood how shitty it would be. After I felt like she had understood, I put the issue behind me and helped support her thru the hassle of moving.&#x200B;A few days after she left, I got a call from a mutual friend who delves into the Wiccan/Metaphysical realm. She was distraught and confessed to me that shortly before Ashley's move, Ashley had come to her asking for a fertility spell. This friend didn't feel comfortable about it and refused. When pushed, she said she cast a spell for a healthy and honest relationship, but told Ashley it was for fertility.&#x200B;As you can imagine, I was livid. I messaged Ashley, confronting her about what I learned and she laughed it off as she was desperate, but magic is fake anyway, so what's the harm? She then let it slip, that since Chris was planning on getting a vasectomy in a few months, she had poked holes in their condoms as a last ditch effort.&#x200B;At that point, I couldn't stay silent. I gathered up screenshots of all the conversations over the last few months and sent them to Chris. He understandably freaked out and kicked her out. Now, Ashley hates me because she was kicked out after a huge move and didn't have a job or money to make it back. She said I'm a terrible person for putting her and her kids out on the street.&#x200B;Am I the asshole here? Should I have kept quiet?"
310,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my transsexual ex-wife to dress more appropriately?,24189,di6zz9,323,"My former husband (42) came out as a transsexual woman last year. As a male he had recently started to get into crossdressing but assured me it was just a fetish, so I was taken by surprise when he came out as he was always a very traditional, masculine guy. She (now Laura) has not started HRT yet but is living fulltime as a woman. Laura and I no longer live together but we share custody of my son (10).Ever since I moved out and Laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. She's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. Laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.I am fine with what Laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. Recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the ""drag queens son"".I tried to talk about this privately to Laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. My son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. The moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. People were obviously listening and when I gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, Laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because I was jealous of her confidence. To make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that I was a piece of shit for saying what I was. My son and I left in tears but Laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.Ever since then I've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and I was a bad person for asking Laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years. I'm extremely shaken by having a group of complete strangers step in and wonder if I've gotten old and out of touch. It just breaks my heart to see my son becoming so withdrawn and upset over this. AITA for speaking to my ex this way?"
311,Not the A-hole,AITA for making a fake diary entry to catch my stepmom?,24144,i2lo6g,883,"I (17F) have been quarantined with my dad and step mom. My mom is a doctor so she was super paranoid about my family living with her during the pandemic, but as things where I live are settling down she let us come stay with her again. My stepmom has known me for two years and our relationship has always been weird. She’s a nice person but she can be pretty mean and childish if we do something she doesn’t like. She also has a tendency to run to our dad if she hears something bad about us. Long story short, I have a diary and I keep a lot of private stuff in it. Dad called me a few days ago (we were visiting with our mom) saying he has to talk to me when I come back. Apparently I was in trouble because of something I apparently said to stepmom. When he told me what she said I said, I immediately recognized it because I wrote it in my diary. I realized a lot of the stuff I wrote down was stuff she was telling him, so I decided to come up with a plan to see if I was write. I wrote a fake entry basically saying stuff I would never do in a million years and set the trap.Dad calls me while out visiting with friends, and when I come back he grounds me for what I “did”. Stepmom comes in later, apologized and said it sounded “concerning” and she had to tell. I told her it was fake, knew she read my diary and refused to speak to her. My dad came in and tried to talk to me and I told him that stepmom was reading my diary and he didn’t believe me. Now I’m with my mom, and I don’t know if what I did was fair. I felt it was the only way to prove my point and I didn’t know what else to do. AITA?Edit: wow thank you so much for the award! I honestly didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did, but I just want to thank all of you for your support and ideas. A lot of people have been saying to either get a licking diary or an online diary, so I'm looking into that. in the mean time I am currently staying with my mom and I am trying to as long as possible. Overall, I just want to thank you for the kind messages (and bright ideas) that you've given me. Reddit is truly magical <3"
312,Not the A-hole,AITA for yelling at a little girl to get out of my face,24148,c6t9kj,3149,"My newborn's pediatrician is always so crowded in terms of size of waiting room versus number of people waiting. It requires a certain amount of etiquette re: controlling your fuck kid, because there are no toys, no play area, no real space for shenanigans. Enter lady with four kids: A newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). She really really should have brought an iPad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. The mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. Accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. Several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).Her kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. She was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. Ffs at one point when I wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. My newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and I DID NOT feel like entertaining some strange kid. I tried being polite about it ""Sweetie where's your mommy?"" -points to mom- ""Ma'am!"" -points to kid- The lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. Rinse and repeat. I told her she needed to stay with her mom. Little punk deadass says ""I don't wanna"" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. Finally, I'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record ""why is your baby crying? Why is your baby crying! make him stop! I don't like that"" And her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. So now I'm out formula, kid still screaming, and I have a huge mess that I don't have a great way to clean up. I'm at my wits end. I raise my voice at this kid. ""LOOK WHAT YOU DID. I AM NOT YOUR MOM, I AM NOT YOUR BABYSITTER. YOU ARE BOTHERING ME. GET OUT OF MY FACE!!"" People looked at me like I was the biggest bitch on earth. A lady speaking Spanish actually did call me a bitch. The little girl starts crying. I'm not apologizing. The mom confronts me, I tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill I'm prepared to die on.So reddit, AITA?"
313,Not the A-hole,AITA: For not wanting to hide my period from my step-brothers like my step-mum wants me too?,24140,clga5g,2850,"I (F20) recently had to move back in with my dad, step-mum and 2 of my step-brothers (15 and 17). The last time I lived here was 2-3 years ago. Back then I remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my room (on the other side of the house) because she didn’t want her boys to see it. Now it’s not like I was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. Anyway I never stopped using the toilet bin. Now I’m back she’s started a new thing. Moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that I keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when I’m on my period, to under the sink zipped up. I personally think I absolutely should not be hiding the fact I have a vagina and it bleeds. Her boys will grow up thinking it’s gross and something that needs to be hidden. I would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. And I just want to be comfortable in the house I’m living in.Edit: for more info, this isn’t a random house I’ve moved back into. I’ve lived here since I was 3 before my parents got divorced when I was 7. My step mum and her kids moved in when I was 12(ish). I moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons. So this is just as much my house as it is hers, arguably more."
314,Not the A-hole,AITA for disinviting my brother to my wedding after he told me “being gay is wrong”?,24132,hqmqs3,1347,"Little backstory: I’ve been out of the closet since I was 17, in 2007. When I came out, people in my family said some pretty hurtful things, which I totally expected, being from a southern Baptist family in... god, it hurts to admit this but.. Florida😫. But my older brother at the time seemed very receptive, surprisingly. He told me that if my Dad ever gave me any trouble, to call him and he’d talk to him. That was really the last time we talked about it. Flash forward 13 years (I’m 30) and I’m getting married to my fiancé Scott next year in April (if covid so graciously allows). I started putting a package together of fun things from my brother And I’s childhood, all with the intention of asking him to be my best man. However, he called me two weeks ago, claiming he’s wanted to “talk to me about this for a long time”He went into the long tangent about how being gay is wrong and isn’t “what god wants”. He said he thinks Scott is a nice guy and he loves me, but he doesn’t think it’s right that we’re getting married. It was quite a shock as Scott and I have stayed with him multiple times when we visit my hometown. To top it off (and what hurts perhaps the most), he said my three old niece, whom we ADORE, won’t be coming to the wedding because he didn’t “want to have to explain to her what was going on here”.Notice he only said that SHE wasn’t coming to the wedding. I think he fully expected to still be invited after this. His wife, whom he started dating when I was 12, feels the same apparently. My whole dad’s side of the family feels the same way they do, but I’ve already written them off mostly in my mind. My mother is beyond pissed and upset at them. I think what upsets me the most is a sense of betrayal. They were my safe spot in the family. I felt like because they’re close to my age and younger and went to college, they would understand and it wouldn’t be a big deal to them. I almost feel a bit embarrassed because Scott comes from a wonderful Italian Catholic family and they’ve never been anything less than loving and supportive. I told them that, on what is supposed to be one of the happiest days of my life, if they or anyone else is sitting in the audience and in the back of their mind thinking that what we’re doing is wrong or not right, they should just stay home. I know my brother and family love me, but it feels up to a point, conditional, and limited. I told them that they learned being gay is wrong, they weren’t born not liking gay people. So they can unlearn it, if they were willing. But I don’t think that’s going to happen.Edit: okay, legit did not expect this many responses. Been getting some interesting negative feedback. All I will say is that I was genuinely interested in hearing if anyone had an idea somewhere in between “youre the asshole, he’s family. Invite him” and “he’s the asshole, fuck him. Don’t invite him”. I’m a compromising centrist at heart, but wasn’t sure I could see where that could fit here on my own. And no my story isn’t fake. I recorded the conversation"
315,Not the A-hole,"WIBTA if I told my family that our ""secret family recipe"" came from the side of a can?",24130,e6e0fm,2812,"Growing up every year around the holidays my mom would make fudge. The story was this amazing fudge recipe came from her grandma who snagged it from a famous candy maker.  My mom didn't get the recipe until she was an adult and we were always told that we couldn't have it until we were 30. In my late teens my mom asked me to help make the fudge with her a few times. The recipe is very simple and this was all the exposure I needed to memorize it. I've never once needed to write the recipe down. It came out that I had the recipe early and my mom and her mom were both outraged. I was given many warnings against sharing family secrets and told they were disappointed at my sneaking around them. I've never shared the recipe with anyone besides my brother and sister. I don't have the same feelings about recipe hoarding, but I followed tradition. However even now, 15ish years later, I'll get comments about how they don't entirely trust me since I came by the recipe dishonestly. Tonight I was reading an article about a chef doing research on secret family recipes for pickled herring. He managed to get copies of hundreds of recipes-200 of them were identical. He traced them back to a cookbook from the 1960s. This got me thinking about our family recipe. After not much googling at all I found ""our"" exact recipe on the website for an evaporated milk company. They apparently have also printed the recipe on cans over the years. This leads me to believe that either my grandma or her mother actually got the recipe from a can and lied about it's origin. I think this is hilarious and want to share the information. We've been so secretive about a recipe that's in public domain!  There's really no reason to hoard it anymore. Would I be the asshole if I shared this knowledge with my mom?"
316,Not the A-hole,AITA for ignoring my mom asking me to get involved with her new family after I got rich?,24118,bnr2gy,2143,"My mom left my dad when I was 17 (I’m 29 now) and had a new boyfriend literally straight away. We all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. She had 2 more kids with this guy. When my mom and dad broke up I moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. The major reason for this was because she told me to leave as I kept fighting with her new dude. I really did NOT want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and I was really upset that she didn’t give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. When she told me to leave...Something in me changed and I am still unable to forgive her. That solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. And my sister and mom were CLOSE so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. Since I was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc I like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. They gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that’s much they believed in me) and basically, I majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. The profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, I’m living a life I never thought would be for a shmuck like me. I moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we’ve started a new life. I am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and I’m grateful so much bc I was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. For the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. She is getting increasingly more insistent that I go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don’t. She keeps telling me that ‘even if I don’t forgive her I should look out for the kids as they’re innocent in all this’ AITA because day to day I have no interest in helping her or her family? IMO she made her bed and she can lay in it but the guilt eats me alive sometimes. I just can’t forgive her though."
317,Not the A-hole,AITA for “period shaming” my daughter?,24052,i65e2r,1666,"I’m a 41M single dad with a 13 year old daughter Lacey. My wife died in childbirth and it’s just been me and Lacey all her life. My sister has been a big help in raising Lacey, and we do keep in contact with her maternal grandparents. The issue started a couple of months ago when Lacey started her period. I knew this day would come so I spoke to my sister, my female best friend and my mother in law to be well prepared. I gave her the talk with her grandmother and aunt there, I buy her pads and tampons, I even have midol and heating pads ready for Lacey when she needs them. The problem began when I began to notice a smell coming from Lacey’s room. I went in to investigate and found pads and tampons openly disposed of in her wastebasket. I checked her bathroom and it was worse. She had her bloodstained undergarments in the tub.I took out her trash and did my best to get rid of the smell, but I didn’t know what to do with the underwear in the tub. Later, I noticed bloodstains on the couch. It took a while of cleaning but I got them out. I figured that was the end of that.It happened again last month, when I noticed Lacey’s room was stinking again. And I saw she didn’t even wash the underwear from before. The bathroom was unbearable at this point. Then earlier this week, I saw bloodstains on the couch again.I sat Lacey down and told her that she had to learn to properly dispose of her feminine hygiene products and wash her underwear as the smell was becoming too much. And to be careful of getting bloodstains on the couch or anywhere she sits. I also noticed her sheets had a lot of bloodstains and brought this up too. I also let her know that it was okay to get blood on things as long as she washed them, and I wouldn’t be upset if I saw her bloodstained items being washed.Lacey immediately blew up at me saying that periods aren’t gross and that I was period shaming and that I needed to educate myself on menstruation. I then got texts from my sister and MIL scolding me for making Lacey feel ashamed of her bodily functions. But I honestly wasn’t trying to convey that periods are gross. I was trying to convey that her hygiene needed to be addressed and that the smell was becoming unbearable. I just wanted to make sure that Lacey knew how to properly dispose of pads and tampons without it smelling, and that I wouldn’t be annoyed if she washed her bloodstained items AITA here? Was I period shaming my daughter?EDIT:  so I’ve mentioned it in a few comments. I talked to my sister and mil and explained my side. They apologized for misunderstanding and like you guys, have given some good cleaning tips and they’ll talk to Lacey and help her out with the pads and tampons tooEDIT2: so many people here have suggested it and I’ve asked Lacey if her period pain is unbearable or just normal cramps, and left the choice to her as to whether or not she wants to see a specialist but the option is there for her!EDIT3: We have washed the sheets with hydrogen peroxide and purchased some oxyclean for future instances should we need it. Many of you have also suggested period underwear, which again, I have asked her aunt and grandmother about and they’ll be able to give her more info about those as well as different hygiene products she can use."
318,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my to be granddaughter in law some lewd advice after my family asked for some ‘grandmotherly wisdom’?,24023,gfvw7h,1758,"My good friend Gracie made me aware a few weeks ago of a phrase that made both of us laugh til we were sore, a dirty phrase which is ‘the key to a successful marriage is to keep a mans stomach full and balls empty’. Both of us are in our 70’s and jovial and sprightly if I may say so. I liked the phrase – it was funny, and it stuck around in my mind. My family are aware I have a filthy sense of humor and I do like to laugh. My eldest grandson is in his 30’s and recently proposed to his fiancée, they made us aware over it via a family FaceTime session. It was very sweet and everyone was in good spirits, drinking, etc. My granddaughter and daughter pushed me to say a few words in the way of advice, but frankly I wouldn’t know, and I’m not one to give advice anyway. my grandsons fiancée said no no, give us some wisdom! So I said the phrase and the only people who burst out laughing were my grandson and his fiancée. Everyone else looked mortified and my granddaughter immediately started berating me. I told my friends this and they think it wasn’t a big deal but my granddaughter and daughter have texted to say I was inappropriate and ruined a moment."
319,Not the A-hole,AITA for being cold to my ex-fiancé and demanding a paternity test after her infidelity?,24025,b65vaq,1440,"So, right now I'm in kinda a shitty situation. I've been treating my ex-fiance pretty cold and demanding a paternity test for the child she's caring. All of my friends are saying i'm being a major asshole but I don't feel that way, heres the story.I knew my ex for almost 10 years. We go back all the way to high school and have been friends. After we graduated I said fuck it and asked her out and we became a couple. We dated for almost 6 years before she came to me and told me she was pregnant. I won't lie, I loved her at the time and this was actually quite exciting to me so i proposed. She, however, seemed super worried. I sat down and talked with her about it. I told her that even if she did decide to terminate the pregnancy I would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. She was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.These past 7 months have been a roller coaster. She moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. That was until a few weeks ago. An old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. I was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. This guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. It turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. He is not lying about this. He sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. I was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. Along with this, he sent me a string of Facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because I make more money that the real father and she would rather I care for it.Suffice to say, I was fucking pissed. I confronted her, she cried, I cried, it was a mess. In the end I broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. She's in the process of moving out now but I have not said a single word to her. I have pretty much told her that I want her out of my life. I also demanded a DNA test the minute the child is born. If it is mine, i'll help her support it. If not, then I am never seeing her again.I've been cold to her. Her and her parents has tried multiple times to ""work it out"" with me but I've refused any contact with them. At one point she got all of her friends together to try to talk to me and I kicked them out of the apartment with threats of calling the police. Any time she's tried to ""Reconcile"" i've shut it down,My friends are saying i'm in wrong here. According to them she's pregnant and because of that I should at least be helping her till the baby is born even if it isn't mine. I disagree fully. But I could be wrong. Am I letting my own emotions hide the fact from me that i'm an asshole?"
320,Not the A-hole,WIBTA If I sued my boyfriend’s elderly mother and pressed charges against her?,23985,l640cc,1833,"Okay, I know how this sounds. Please hear me out at least.I’ve been with my boyfriend for 11 years, since I was 15. His mother has HATED me since the first day she met me. She hated me due to my ethnicity, (Kosovan Albanian) she hated me due to my career, I work as a model and she decided that makes me an empty headed, vain, shallow person. Then when I told her I still planned to go to university alongside my career she said I was doing it to “impress” my boyfriend. I’ve since left uni with a distinction and her new reason to hate me is… I try too hard? She has also insisted I’ve cheated on him throughout our entire relationship which is a ridiculous claim, I’ve never even kissed another man in my whole LIFE. I have zero desire to cheat and never will.Late last year she attempted to void the insurance on my boyfriend’s motorbikes, she tried to do this under my name so, hypothetically, when he was arrested for riding with no insurance and called his insurance company, I’d get the blame. After this happened my boyfriend and I agreed to cut her out, however it hasn’t stuck, she left my boyfriend alone and respected his wishes for NC but she’s continued to contact and harass me.This leads to the last few weeks, my boyfriend works as a motorcycle test rider and he got in an awful motorbike crash while working, as such I now need to care for him. I’m okay with that and I’m focusing on seeing it as an opportunity for us to get closer, it’s been nice honestly. However his mother has been AWFUL to me. She’s called me litany of terms. From things as tame as stupid to things as awful as a “Nasty Serbian half breed.” I’m not Serbian and she’s well aware that calling a Kosovan a Serb is offensive. I tried to block her so she started making new iMessage accounts and began to continuously harass me via those accounts.Then came Friday night. The police turned up at our door. I was pretty confused and was quickly told they were there to do a welfare check as they’d received “multiple” claims of horrific abuse I was apparently putting my poor boyfriend under. Obviously they quickly discovered he was fine, albeit grumpy and they left. I know for a fact it was his mother, some of the details the police mentioned made that obvious. I’m now at a point where I’ve realised I literally cannot do this. I’m going to press charges against her for the insurance and harassment (it’s a crime in the UK) and I’m likely going to sue her for damages, for the sake of my mental health I need to do this. I don’t want to be a victim and she needs to be forced to stop. I have mentioned my intentions to her if she doesn’t back off and she’s pretty much mocking me and saying I won’t. I absolutely will. I just feel like this morally may make me an awful person. She sucks, I know this, however she’s old and miserable enough as is and I feel like doing this may ruin whatever small amount of life she has left. It feels like it may be too far. I really don’t know though and I genuinely cannot be objective here.WIBTA here if I did this?Edit: When I say I need to care for my boyfriend, I mean he’s essentially immobile, he’s not being unsupportive, he’s just barely able to take care of himself, let alone battle his mother too."
321,Not the A-hole,AITA for not helping my son and his wife with my grandson?,23960,c9gtj9,934,"Necessary information: When my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. After a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. Except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.That was when my husband and I stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. When she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and I still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. Once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.&#x200B;Now, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. He's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. My daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. Since I'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. I asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. I asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. I also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.&#x200B;He thought of asking me because I had helped his brother all those years ago and it would ""basically be the same thing"". I told him that no, it was not. I was 42 then and I'm 59 now, I didn't had the health issues that I do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. Also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  I would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. Now he thinks I'm playing favorites and that I'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but I think I'm just being reasonable.&#x200B;Edit: While it is nice to know that I'm not the asshole, my son has found the post and is now very mad at me for ""shaming him and his wife on the internet"". I disagree as it was not my intent and I never disclosed any information that could be used to identify them both. He's also very mad about being called an asshole. While he is my son, I find that he needs a wake up call since my conversation with him in private about the issue only made him behave like a spoiled child and his reaction to me looking for input as an anonymous person was to call and yell at me on the phone. I'll let this post stay up and let this be a lesson to him."
322,Not the A-hole,AITA for shutting down talk about having kids with “purposely controversial statements?”,23960,hklj0n,1582,"   Our region has done well handling COVID, so my husband and I had a small group of family over for a backyard BBQ a month ago.We’re the only ones in the family “left” who don’t have kids. We’re not going to. We prefer our lives as mountaineers. His family thinks we'll change our minds. Mind you, husband had the snip.MIL jokingly mentioned that maybe with all the “alone time” we’d be giving the family a little bundle of joy. We shut the idea down with good humor. She kept pressing, and SIL chimed in with “Come on, this is the perfect time to get started!”Husband: We’ve talked about this already. Let’s drop it.MIL: Well, I don’t care. Husband: Again, drop it.MIL: I hope it happens!Husband: Thankfully we’re very careful.MIL: Accidents happen. It isn’t always up to you.Husband: Yes, it is. I had a vasectomy. Like I said, discussion over. Can we move on?We do, but MIL and SIL are whispering with each other and shooting glances, looking at their phones, etc. BIL and I are laughing about something dumb on TV, seems like everything is fine.Until SIL says, “Vasectomies can fail, you know! It’s not a 100% thing.”It gets quiet, MIL & SIL look smug.MIL: So there’s still a chance you can get pregnant, you can NEVER be sure!Husband & I lock eyes. Party’s over.Me: That is exactly what abortions are for.Cue screaming and yelling, I’m an evil, cruel bitch, what kind of monster, etc. His family are all supposedly pro-choice.Husband yells at them to GTFO, don’t talk to me like that. MIL gets up in his face and yells that I said I would kill her grandbabies, how could he stand to hear it.Husband: And I would hold her fucking hand the entire time because it’s what BOTH of us would want.Party’s over. Cue FB shitstorm. MIL’s post tags us, says: “We were having a nice family get together and OP and Husband had bait us with purposely controversial statements. Every mom lives to see her babies have babies. Yesterday I was told that my cruel DIL would murder my grandbabies if she got pregnant and my son would hold her hand while she did it.”I do not feel like we’re assholes, even for how we handled the situation. There was no getting through to them without being direct and final. This isn’t the first time we tried to get them to drop the subject. However, other family members really think we are in the wrong and that I went over the line. Reddit, we are the assholes here?"
323,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my brother in law he's a walking advertisement for abortion?,23904,j82zzp,1850,"My wife was more than five months pregnant when we learned that our daughter would not survive outside the womb. We were devastated, as this was a very wanted pregnancy. My wife made the difficult decision to have an induction abortion. The procedure itself went as expected, and she is physically fine. Emotionally, we are both still grieving. I was with her the whole time.Yesterday, we had a family gathering. My family knew we were expecting, and I had the horrible job of telling them we had lost the baby. My parents and sister expressed their sympathies. However, bil, who is extremely pro-life, throughout the night told my wife repeatedly her that she was a murderer and that she killed her own daughter, and all sorts of other awful things that made her feel much worse. I was appalled when I caught him doing this, and my wife was on the verge of breaking down all over.I yelled at him, pointing out how he had gotten a DUI in the past that put another person in the hospital, how he was working a low-paying job selling cigarettes that kill thousands of people every year at a convenience store, and how I had needed to bail him and my sister out financially more than once for medical reasons. Then I ended with ""If anything, you're a walking advertisement for abortion. Your mother probably wishes she had aborted you.""I took my wife home, furious. Then later, I got a call from my sister. She apologized initially, saying she realized what her husband had said was out of line, but then tried to justify it by pointing out that he was raised to believe abortion was wrong. I should have been more understanding, and it was unfair of me to point out his past struggles when he had been doing better recently. I cussed her out and hung up, but now I'm wondering if I did go too far? AITA for basically telling my brother in law he should have been aborted?Update: thank you all so much for the support. My sister called me a few hours ago, and we talked. It turns out she didn't know what he had actually said. He made it seem like he had just said he disagreed with abortion, which I would say is still unacceptable to tell grieving parents. But when I told her what he actually said, she was horrified. She apologized profusely and is now considering leaving him (there were a lot of other red flags in their relationship). She's now fully on our side and can't believe her husband could be so vile"
324,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my mom we haven’t had a good relationship in a long time and I wanted to go live with my dad?,23902,l26p6d,1549,"I (16F) used to have a good relationship with my mother. That has since crashed and burned since she dated and married my stepdad “Gary” six years ago. Gary treats his son “Ian” (19M) like he’s the center of the universe and expects my mother to as well, so she does. Anything Ian wants, Ian gets and that usually comes at the expense of me. Ian wanted my room when they moved it? I was forced to go to another room to “make the transition easier for everyone.” Ian wanted a car for his 16th birthday? I didn’t get braces for another year. Ian wanted to go on an expensive trip for Spring Break? I had to give up Volleyball to make it happen. Ian wanted to have his side of the family over? I was expected to find somewhere else to be, since I wasn’t family. My mother just went along with all of this and acted like it shouldn’t affect me at all.My dad was overseas for a long time, and we used to FaceTime and he was so upset by what he was hearing. He’s home now and he’s offering to have me come live with him. I’m not seeing a reason not to go, and so I told my mom I wanted to go live with my dad. She predictably freaked out and asked why I’d want to do that and said that we had such a good relationship, she didn’t understand how this came so out of the blue. I told her that we haven’t had a good relationship since she blindly decided to follow Gary’s lead and give Ian anything he wanted, and it always came at my expense. My mom tried to argue so I said, I also wanted to leave because she let them kick me out of my own house because ”I wasn’t family” so I was going to go live with someone who was. My mom started crying and said she wouldn’t let me go, so I told her that my dad was willing to go to court over it and I was old enough to be able to say where I wanted to be. She’s been a crying mess since I told her, and Gary is being a jackass about how awful I’m being.  Here’s where I might be the asshole. He was bitching at me about how terribly I’m treating them and how I’m not thinking about them at all. I asked why should I, he never thought of me when he was taking things from me to give to his kid. I said let’s face facts here, you don’t care about me, what you care about is losing the child support you spend on your son. He sort of went slack jawed and I walked off. My dad said my mom called and threatened to take him to court, so he said he’d see her there. Now she’s panicking because she realized he is planning on taking her to court over this. Mom and Gary of course think I’m the asshole for “making things hard” for everyone, but my dad and grandparents say to leave and never look back. AITA for wanting to get away from this situation?"
325,Not the A-hole,AITA for how I responded to a senior HR member accusing me of taking drugs at work?,23905,kbp9mo,1126,"Background: I have diagnosed bipolar disorder. I’ve been on medication over a year and it’s the best damn decision I’ve ever made. That being said, I have a tendency to go off my meds when I’m manic. It’s not fun when the meds wean out of my system and I go nuts. In order to not sabotage myself, I take my meds everyday at 11 am. It helps me settle myself for the rest of the day, and keeps me on a strict schedule. Incident:My workplace has shifted online fully. We had a zoom call yesterday with HR to update everybody on COVID measures going forward for the upcoming quarter and it was about 30 or so people on the call. HR has been anal retentive about people keeping their videos on throughout the meeting; nobody is allowed to move out of the screen. The meeting began at 9 am. 11 am comes around and my alarm buzzes to remind me about the medication. I moved slightly out of frame and took them while still on the call. I didn’t think anybody noticed but apparently this senior HR person we’ll call Q, did. The meeting wraps up at 12 noon, and as we’re all getting ready to sign off, Q tells me to stay behind after everybody leaves, in front of them. I found that unprofessional but held my tongue. Q then launched on this long diatribe about how I’m setting a “hostile work environment” by taking my meds during work hours, that I’m being neglectful of my duties, and that I’m “ruining my body” with them. When I finally got a chance to respond, I said that the “drugs” I’m taking are prescription medication, and that I fail to see how the five seconds it takes me to take them is creating a hostile work environment. I said that my medical history is none of their business, and since they have failed to demonstrate any real harm in the situation, I didn’t feel like this discussion was warranted. Q looked like they’d swallowed sour milk and told me they’d be writing me up and that I was officially being warned for my behavior. I saw red and right after the call ended, sent an email to the head of HR (R) summarizing the conversation and refuting the warning/write ups. I stated the relevant legal protections accorded to employees in such situations and that I hoped R would address this fairly. R looked into the matter and I learned later that Q had been suspended without pay. A bunch of my coworkers caught onto what happened, and are now making it very difficult to work with them. Apparently Q was a popular person in the office and they felt that complaining to the head of HR was taking it too far. This entire situation feels utterly surreal and I can’t think of any reason why I’d be the asshole, but I’m facing an uncomfortable work situation and want to know if I need to apologize and smooth things over."
326,Not the A-hole,AITA for burning bridges with my in-laws at my husband's funeral?,23891,fegt59,1803,"I married ""Jake"" when we both were 19 - I know in hindsight that that was dumb, but it was common in the area. We're from an area with little in the way of opportunities, and while I did well enough to get scholarships and attend college, Jake decided to join the military. We talked extensively about this, and he was vocal in his intention to only join for one term to get the GI Bill and then get out and go to college.When I married him, Jake was a sweet, funny guy who enjoyed cooking and the only things he'd willingly hurt were deer. But after he joined, Jake changed. He got a lot angrier, in general. I'd never known him to have a temper, but he went from never raising his voice to yelling at his family and me when he didn't get his way, to less pleasant behavior when he was drunk. And oh how he drank. I have nothing against a beer with friends now and then, but after joining the military Jake was drinking constantly. His sense of humor got a lot cruder, too, ""Dirty little sheet heads!"" became his favorite punchline.The final straw was when we discussed his plans to get out and go to college since he was looking at whether to stay in or get out. He wanted to stay in. I reminded him he'd promised to get out. He'd been drinking, and things got ugly.The wives' club at the base was no help, so I started quietly looking into how to divorce Jake. Then, earlier this year, he died in a car accident. My only feeling was, honestly, relief. I went to his funeral and didn't say anything at the service, but at dinner Jake's little sister approached me and said she'd started dating a soldier and wanted to know if I had any advice. My advice? ""Don't. The military ruined Jake and turned the man I loved into a drunk, abusive asshole.""Jake's family predictably erupted in a firestorm, but more alarmingly to me, my own parents have taken their side.AITA?"
327,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to move?,23838,lv8rm1,1389,"My (f42) husband (m44) and I have been married for 21 years. We have two adult children (m22 and m24), one is in college out of state and the other is in the navy.When we first got married, my husband was in navy, and we spent the first 10 years of our marriage moving from place to place, wherever his new duty station was. I found it hard to make friends, and I could not keep a job, so I made a difficult decision and decided to be a SAHM. When he got out of the navy eleven years ago, he took a job and we moved. Three years in, he got offered a job in another part of the company, however, it was in another state, so we moved again. We stayed there for six years. I went back to college and got my degree and began looking for work. I found a job I liked in my field, and six months into working, he said he was offered a job with a new company and wanted to take it, but that would mean we would be moving almost 2,000 miles from where we were in a new state. I reluctantly agreed because the new state would have more job opportunities for me and we would be closer to our family, which is something that we have not had in many years. Last night my husband came up to me and said that there was a job opening in his company and he wanted to apply for it. It would mean a pay raise and better hours, but the caveat would be that we have to move again. We have been living in our new state for three years. I love it here. I have an amazing job and I am making great money. I finally have friends and am able to socialize. I told him that I am not moving again. Any time we have to move, he always leaves first and I end up being responsible for selling/packing the house, and I am not doing that again. Our sons college is only 2 hours from here, we can see him twice a month. If we move, that means we would have at least a days drive and would only be able to do that once or twice a year!Now my husband is upset with me and guilt tripping me because he claims I do not  support him. I told him that was BS because I spent most of my life moving from place to place to support his career. He told me that I am selfish and he is just trying to provide for us. I told him that we are more than comfortable where we are now, and that if he truly wants to take the job, he will be going alone.AITA for refusing to move again?*post update*I hope that this is allowed. I apologize for not being able to respond to everyone. And thank you all for your kindness and replies. To answer some questions.1. My husband and I have been together since I was 15 and he was 17. He joined the navy right after graduation from high school when he was 18 and I was 16, but had to wait two years before we could marry. 2. He works for a company that has plants in 15 states. He is currently in middle management, but if he wants to advance his career further, he would need to go to another plant out of state. 3. Financially we are more than comfortable. We do not need anymore money. 4. My son plans to stay in the place he is after college. We have a great relationship with him and he comes home one time a month and we see him one time a month. My other son comes home on leave whenever he can and stays with us. We are very close to both of the boys. 5. I talked to my husband again tonight and told him quite firmly that moving again was not an option for me. The area he wants to moves has very little jobs in my field and specialty in that area and I would need to commute more than an hour one way for a job versus the 20 minutes I have here. We are sandwiched between two major cities, and if we move we would be an hour from the most major city. I would also have to take a massive pay cut and work a menial job to build a new network to find employment in my field. 6. My husband is disappointed in me for not wanting to leave. He left to stay with a friend because he “needs to think.” He doesn’t understand why I would force him to turn down an opportunity to advance his career further. I told him to take all the time he needs, but I am not moving again. I said I would revisit the possibility when I am ready for retirement in 15 years but no sooner."
328,Not the A-hole,AITA for not letting my boyfriend pay less on bills due to a new purchase because he wouldn’t let me when I made less money than him?,23830,lozxuk,1419,"My boyfriend of two years and I live together. We split expenses 50/50 when it comes to rent, groceries, utilities, things for our house, etc. we both make about the same money working full time. We keep our finances such as our own vehicles, doctor bills, cell phone bills, etc separate. My boyfriend recently made an irresponsible and unnecessary purchase. To keep it short, I won’t go into details but it was something he absolutely did not need, just wanted and it has made his disposable income significantly less. This has been a sore subject between us. The other day he asked me to sit down and talk. He told me since he paid more on his personal bills a month, he felt like we needed to adjust how much we each paid on shared expenses. So basically, he felt he should get to pay less.This made me mad for a few reasons. First, as I said, the purchase was absolutely not necessary by any means. And when we first started living together I made way less money than I do now. I worked part time at another job and made 12 less dollars on the hour than him. However, then he refused to budge on letting me pay less bills, so I budgeted and saved and always had everything paid despite that. So, I told him no. I told him he was not willing to pay more than me when I made way less money than he did, and the purchase was unnecessary and he knew it would make his finances difficult. If he couldn’t pay OUR bills, he needed to leave. He of course thinks I’m an asshole for not budging on the issues. I think it’s only fair. AITA here?Edit: it was a motorcycle"
329,Not the A-hole,WIBTA if I reported my daughter’s teacher for not pronouncing her name correctly?,23830,jg5jp8,2262,"My daughter’s English teacher refuses to pronounce her name correctly. She has a Japanese name and we live in Japan.  Her name is Kanae, pronounced Kaa-Naa-EH.Recently, Kanae told me that her English teacher(an expat from America) at school calls her “Kah-Nye”. She told me that she told the teacher “My name Kanae. It’s three claps (syllables)”. But the English teacher told Kanae that she was incorrect, and that grammatically speaking that she , her teacher, was correct.During my daughters sports day I “confronted” the teacher . I explained that my daughter would like the be called “Kaa-naa-eh”. But she laughed and said she was pronouncing it the way it’s “supposed to be” but will try her best to remember.Today, my daughter told me the teacher still calls her Kah-Nye. My daughter is very very shy and it took a lot for her to correct her teacher the first time.  I’m considering going to the school in the  morning. But is that an over reaction?(For some clarity; I am not Japanese, my wife is so our kids are mixed-race. Our kids are fluent in English and Japanese. )🧚🏿‍♂️🧚🏿‍♂️👉🏽Not like Kanye WestBut Kah. Plus Nye like Bill Nye 👈🏼:::::oh wow! I wrote this late at night and went to sleep. I didn’t expect it to get this much attention! Thank you for all of the responses. I can’t reply to them all. But this morning we couldn’t go(son had an earache) but we are going there after school ends. We asked our daughter if she wanted us to tell. She said that she didn’t care.  We don’t want the teacher fired, we just want our daughter respected in her classroom::⛩⛩Update: I’m not sure where else to place it:::But my wife and I went to the school today around 3:45pm. By then the English teacher in question had gone home. We told the principal everything that I’ve told you all and he was extremely apologetic. He did say that maybe it was a language barrier. But I reminded him that my daughter and I both told the teacher in English how to pronounce Kanae.So then the principal called her dispatch company (Interac it turns out). The same thing happened. The company apologized but tried to pass it off as a language barrier thing.More apologizes were issued when we told themwe spoke English. We were told that interac would speak to the teacher, and that they would handle it.They principal asked us to come to the school Monday morning. I’m hoping to talk to the teacher face to face on that day.❤️💚Final (maybe) update.  This morning I met with the school board, principal, the dispatch company, and the teacher in question! I honestly didn’t expect everyone there. It was very traditional Japanese apology. Deep bows from everyone (even the American teacher). She wrote (I think it was written for her because it didn’t sound natural and she made several mistakes)I don’t remember it word for word but it said “ I sincerely apologize to the (our family name) and most sincerely to Kanae(she said it correctly). I now realize how important names are to the Japanese people. Please accept my dearest condolences(yes this was actually said).”The teacher promised to treat Kanae with more respect.She also apologized for not respecting me during the sports day. Honestly the only “real” thing that she said is when Kanae was brought in and the teacher kneeled down and said “Kanae. I am really sorry”. It seemed heartfelt Kanae being Kanae made the teacher a cardI forgive her.  So does my daughter. I have no idea what is going to happen career wise however.  Her company seemed very very upset.But my daughter feels better Thank you all so much"
330,Not the A-hole,"AITA for telling my family that if they want Thanksgiving, they'll have to get off their asses and plan it?",23815,k0e173,3117,"Usually for Thanksgiving, we head out to go see family. Someone else always hosts (we typically help ""sponsor"" the host by paying for clean-up, etc, our home is just too small to host the 30+ folks who typically show up through the day). This year that's obviously not happening.Other than us talking about not doing the usual, Thanksgiving didn't come up until yesterday. My kids have the week off from online school, and I was doing a puzzle with them before dinner when my husband walks in after work and says: ""So did we get a turkey?""I looked at him and said ""Well, I know I didn't. Did you?""He stared at me blankly and said ""No. What do you mean? Do we need to get one still? Is it being delivered?""I shrugged and said ""I don't know nothing about no turkey.""The kids and he looked so confused, so I helped them along and said ""I didn't buy anything. I didn't plan anything. No one said anything to me about Thanksgiving. Nobody offered to help meal plan, cook anything, do anything.""He blew up yelling at me about how I should have obviously known.I said, why? I've literally never planned or made a Thanksgiving dinner in my life. The most I've ever done was help clean up or maybe peel the potato. I asked him why didn't ***HE*** plan anything, why didn't the kids plan anything? Why is everyone waiting until the last minute and dumping it on me?He just sputtered and yelled and stormed off to his ""office"" and left me with the kids. We all had dinner, the kids cleaned up, and I was relaxing with some wine and a book after they all went to bed. My husband tore into me about how he can't believe I left this all to the last minute, now there will be no Thanksgiving, how could I know be heartbroken to do this to the kids, etc.So I just looked at him and said ""Why didn't you plan? Why did you wait to the last minute to ask me?""He told me I was being a fucking bitch for no reason and stomped off to go sleep in his office. He left without saying a word this morning. I followed up with my kids and asked them if they wanted Thanksgiving. They said they didn't care because the food isn't that good most of the time anyway.Before you ask, yup, I work as well. We split chores but there's no hardline. I do some, he does some. We both cook, and the oldest cooks as well. I just don't get why Thanksgiving is on my plate. Why, just because I'm a woman? Lmao fuck that.AITA?**ETA:** Thanks for the judgments, all. A lot of people seem to think that my kids are like, toddlers or something. They're old enough to help make the menu for dinners, help with cooking, etc. It's weird how many people came up with info here, like I was ""getting down on the floor playing"" rather than me and the kids... sitting at the table doing a puzzle.Anyway, I told my husband that if he wants to do some traditional Thanksgiving with all the fattening, carby, salty, beige food, he can go ahead and plan it and I'll help in the same capacity as always. If he wants me and the kids to cook something together (aka a normal, average Thursday) I'll continue with what was scheduled.The kids genuinely do not care. Thanksgiving doesn't mean anything to them. One of them has been asking for us to stay home for years. One of them barely touches the food as it, and the other one only likes to go so she can see her cousins, and she sees them all the time anyway. The middle kid already dug out another puzzle for us and they're just happy they're off school.Also, we don't do Christmas. Check your biases, folks. Don't leap to conclusions based on what you *want* to have happened."
331,Not the A-hole,"AITA For ""Ruining"" my kid's life after she ruined a dress?",23813,hfhlrg,4220,"Ex(31) and I(m32) had C, (F16) way too young. We're friendly co-parents. One big rule we share is if our daughter breaks something, she pays for it.Now, sis (27) and I are the only grandkids. Aunt never married. Instead, she worked with Gma and Gpa at their seamstry store, and took it over when they retired.Sis's girlfriend (29) proposed last year. Gpa offered to make FSIL a custom suit, which she was over the moon about. Gma had me ask Sis what her dream dress was and record the convo. Sis, thinking it was just between us, told me in great detail what her dream dress was, though said it was way too expensive, so she would get something much cheaper. Well, a few months later Gma surprised Sis with her dream wedding dress. It fot perfectly and everyone cried. Sadly, Gma recently passed away, which hit us all hard. Sis was devistated, but decided that the dress meant Gma would still be there with us at the wedding. The issue comes in with C. She's very large, much larger then Sis. Three days ago, we decided to go visit Sis and see how she was doing. It was great, but then C asked if she could try on the dress. Sis politely said no. C made a face, but dropped it. Later, we decided to go grab dinner. Sis and I went to pick up our orders, but C decided to stay and play with Sis's dog.We got back, and the dress was destroyed. C had apparently tried to get it on, popping some seams, and got stuck. Instead of waiting for help, she cut her way out. The dress was hacked to bits.Sis was devistated and asked us to leave. I grounded C, and called Aunt with some pictures, asking if it could be saved. She said there was no. She said she'd make a new one, but it wasnt the same. Then she dropped the bomb on me - Gma had hand sewed most of the dress, used super expensive fabric, and put almost 500 hours in making that dress, since it was the only family wedding we'd have. In total, the dress cost 12,000 dollars, give or take. C has about 15,000 saved from various jobs, as well as winning writing competitions. This was supposed to help her in college. I took her to the bank and set in motion transferring all the funds, since as her parent I still have control over it. $12k to Aunt to pay for the new dress. $3k to my sister's wedding, as an emotional distress tax. I explained exactly why this was happening to C, but she sobbed the entire time, asking what was she supposed to do for college and saying it wasnt her fault. I told her she could get a job if she didnt get a scholarship, and it was her fault for trying on the dress after she'd been told no, and for not waiting until we got back. A few popped seams could have been fixed. Hacking the dress to pieces couldnt. C told my ex, and while she agreed C was in the wrong after the full story, said I shouldnt have ""ruined her future"" for a ""free"" dress. I reminded her of our rule, and she still thinks I'm wrong. So, am I the asshole here?Edit - since people are mentioning they dont understand the 3k, that was to make up to my sister that C destroyed the last gift our dead grandma ever gave her. I consider that part of the price of destroying the dress, since even if Aunt remakes it, its lost a great deal of its sentinent value. I pointed out how young we has her because I wanted to explain how a 31 year old has a 16 year old kid. I do not resent having her, she's the best thing Ive ever done. I also brought up C's size because Sis has crohn's disease, and thus is very tiny. The dress was made her for size, and C is much larger then Sis. I love C as she is, but just holding the dress up, it was clear it wouldnt fit. The character count is very limiting.Edit 2 - to clarify, the money was C's ""have fun at college"" money, not her college fund. My ex and I are paying for whatever scholarships dont. When she was asking what she would do for college, she was askong what'd she do for fun and to buy things we didnt pay for. Again, the character count is very limiting, so i had to cut details to post.Edit 3 - So, I got off the phone with my ex about 20 minutes ago. At some of your suggestions, I sent her the pictures, and she freaked. She apparently didnt believe me when I said it had be hacked apart, and believed it was just a few torn seams. She was pretty much on my side after. She told me that she's spent the day badgering our daughter, asking her why she did what she did, and finally C cracked and said she was mad that Grandma wasnt alive to make her a dress, and that it was ""unfair"" my sister got a free beautiful dress as a reminder when my daughter got ""nothing,"" despite the many things she was given after the funeral. She tried it on, took it off when the seams popped, and then in anger hacked it apart. If she couldnt have a dress from Grandma, no one could. Her own words. Honestly, knowing she did it on purpose has just made things worse. The fact that she could be so cruel, thats not the daughter we tried to raise. She will be going to therapy, whether that's in person when local therapists start taking new clients again or on one of those apps people have mentioned. We need to talk about it more. Her punishment stands as is, though we're going to see how therapy goes. As for all the seamsters who have reached out, please know I'm touched by your kindness. I really am. My aunt is going to see if she can incorporate at least some of the fabric from the old dress into the new one, maybe at least try to save the beading, but if there's anything usable I'll reach out. I so so appreciate all of your offers, youre incredibly kind people. I have yet to talk to my sister, but I have talked to her fiance. Sis isnt doing well. The stress has caused a crohns flare up, so she's stuck in bed sick. Which, honestly, I'm not surprised. Crohns is often triggered by stressful events, so I was expecting it. I told fiance about Aunt making a new dress, and she promised to take the remains over to Aunt on Monday. She's thankful for us addressing the issue, but has asked for some space from Sis so she can recover and heal, and hopefully not end up in the hospital. As for the 3k, we'll see what my sister's state is in a few days. If she has to go to the hospital, then the money is forfit for her medical bills, since it was C's selfishness that put her there, so she can pay for it. If Sis does not end up in the hospital, then I'll consider giving it back after she's gone to therapy for a few months, if she's accepted what she did was wrong and worked to make ammends. We'll see what the next few monthd bring."
332,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my SIL that I don't care that her baby died and to leave me alone?,23768,ig6m0w,1827,"Me and SIL, Daisy, have been friends since High School (15 years ago). I started dating her brother, Dan, when we were all in college. Daisy married Matt sometime after I married Dan 10 years ago. Matt and Daisy wanted a baby and starting trying right after marriage but they were having a lot of trouble. I am talking multiple failed IVF's, multiple late term miscarriages (one of which was a stillbirth). The struggle went on for for 7 years. I have helped her immensely through everything, financially and emotionally. Matt is... unsympathetic sometimes. He behaves as if it's a batch of bad cookies and immediately guilts her into trying again. So, it always was up me and Dan to take care of her. Despite many talks from me and Dan, she remained married to him and kept trying again and again. We have had many offers to leave the state/country for a better job, but didn't because we were scared to leave her alone. 3 years ago, I got pregnant. We broke the new gently to Daisy one day. She got real quiet and then asked us to leave. Later, she sent me an email saying she doesn't want to see me or Dan anymore and that this is all too much. We tried to console her but didn't work, so gave her space. 2 weeks before I was supposed to give birth, Dan passed away in an accident. I don't have any family except for Dan and Daisy. Daisy refused to attend the funeral because she will have to see me. The day before the funeral and I called her and begged her to come. I didn't think that I would be able to go through that without her. She hung up on me and didn't attend the service. Soon after that, I gave birth and I decided to move to another state. I cut off all contact with Daisy and started fresh. Now, me and my daughter are very happy and we are enjoying a comfortable life. She attempted to contact me once I moved away but I ignored her. 2 weeks ago, she called from an unknown number and said she desperately wanted to talk to me. Turns out she finally got pregnant, had a baby boy who passed away 5 days after being born in NICU. Matt is also leaving her and screwed her over because of the prenup. She is basically broke and homeless days after losing a child. I just said ""Ok"". She then asked ""Are you really not going to say anything? You are really not going to help?""I pretty much said, ""I don't care about you. I don't care about your life. I don't care about Matt. I don't care that your baby died. Just leave me and my daughter alone."" and then hung up. Since then she has been sending me multiple emails and vm's stating how awful I am and how heartless and how much Dan would be disappointed. I continued to just ignore everything. So, AITA?. Edit: Please don't DM me about leaving a person homeless during pandemic. I am already aware of the fact. I don't care. No matter what anyone says I am not going to have any sympathy or help her in any way. I am only asking for a judgement on what I said and how I said it.Edit 2: I am getting a lot of annoying DM's because someone cross posted this somewhere else. Please stop. Edit 3: Please stop giving me unsolicited advise regarding changing my mind about helping her. That's not going to happen. If I wanted advice, I would have posted it in relationship_advice, not here. I only asked you to judge what I said to her and how I said it. I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ADVICE. So, please stop."
333,Not the A-hole,AITA for refusing to buy a coworker lunch,23742,jw1riz,1188,"I (23M) have a coworker (25M) who is a mooch. If you get something for lunch, he wants you to get him something too, but expects you to buy it for him because since you mentioned it, he says you offered. At first I thought maybe he had money problem, but then overheard him laughing and bragging to someone in another department about how he was able to scam lunches out of his coworkers, and he’s attempted to bully a free meal out of someone more than once. His general entitled attitude is one of the many reasons I don’t like him.So yesterday my girlfriend and I had lunch together. He overheard me confirming before I left and asked what I was bringing him and I said nothing. He said I brought it up, and I corrected him. No, I was confirming we were still good and he was eavesdropping on my conversation. He started complaining so I had if he gave me money for his food I’d bring him something but I wasn’t going to buy him food. He started complaining about it again and I got irritated and said no money no food, and then I left.When I got back my boss said my coworker complained I was being hostile. I told him what happened and how he’s constantly trying to weasel free food out of people, even some of the people he knows are struggling. So my boss asked around and several others collaborated what I said. My coworker got dragged into the office and now he’s pissed that I “narc’d” and how he was just kidding. Most of the office thinks he got what he deserved but a few think it wasn’t worth getting him in trouble over.Today no one he asked told him what they were doing for lunch, and he’s whining that we’re alienating him. I said he alienated himself because of his behavior. He said I’m an asshole, but I don’t really feel bad that a mooch who thinks it’s funny to scam his coworkers thinks I’m an asshole. My little brother is on here a lot and suggested I post though, so AITA?"
334,Not the A-hole,AITA for asking my friend for a “boob-voyage” party?,23720,h79apz,1938,"A while ago, my doctor found a cancerous lump in my breast. Thankfully it was stage 1, but I did end up having a mastectomy. It was a stressful time, and when my friend was over a few days before my surgery, we got on the topic of the “boob-voyage” party from Jane the virgin. I asked her if she would throw me one of those parties to help me get my mind off it. I thought she would put together just a small girls night, but she went all out. She invited all of my friends and my boyfriend and had an array of boob paraphernalia. It was funny and lighthearted and meant a lot to me to get all that support from my friends.During my recovery, my boyfriend confronted me and said that he hated the boob party, he thought it was tacky, and he was offended that I hadn’t asked him to put something together instead. He said that we were supposed to be going through it together and I should have thought about his feelings and the fact that he doesn’t like parties and wouldn’t want to spend one of the nights leading up to my surgery like that. I told him that I’m sorry he felt that way, but it was really helpful for me and I was the one getting surgery and treatment. I told him I wanted to support him but my feelings had to take priority under those particular circumstances and the party helped me. He’s still angry at me for refusing to apologize for asking my friend to throw the party without asking how he felt about it first. It comes up now and again and he still wants me to apologize. AITA?"
335,Not the A-hole,AITA for moving all my stuff to my guest room after my husband refused to stop turning the light on at 3am?,23701,j195ol,2457,"My husband just got promoted to shift manager 3 weeks ago. This meant that his 10am-6pm shift has now been switched 4am to noon. He isnt a morning person AT ALL so most mornings he will start huffing and puffing as soon as his alarm goes off and he will instantly turn on our light and very loudly start looking for his work clothes.I have asked him several times to put clothes out the night before and he has yet to do so. I have also asked him to not turn the light on or be super loud. After all, when I worked at 5am I made sure to be respectful of him sleeping. So yesterday morning when he got up at 3am and flipped on the light, I grabbed my stuff and went to the guest room. He came in and asked what I was doing. I told him that since he didnt respect me sleeping, at all, that I would be staying in the guest room from now on. He made a comment about ""The light will only be on for 5 freaking minutes."" Which is not true. He turns the light on, finds himself clothes and then goes to take a shower without turning the light off. If I turn the light off, he will come back into the room after the shower and turn it on again to grab his socks and put on his shoes. (Which also pisses me off because shoes stay in the kitchen by the door and there's no reason he cant put them on at the table).Anyways, instead of understanding, he just got angry. Mainly because he is not a morning person and he doesnt like dealing with anything in the AM. So, while he was at work yesterday, I moved all my stuff into the guest room. Last night he practically begged me to sleep in the bedroom and promised to let me sleep. Well, this morning he flips on the fucking light again so I sit up and I'm like ""Are you kidding me right now?"" And he says ""I'm being quiet!"" As if that was the only issue. So I went into the guest room and locked the door. I told him I was staying in here from now on despite his efforts to sway me. He thinks I'm overreacting. AITA?EDIT FOR THE TROLLS OF REDDIT: I do in fact work. So your assumption that I dont is not only mislead but pretty ignorant. Also, the assumption that everything I have is due to my husband working, another ignorant statement. Not that it matters for the context of this post but I work 4pm to midnight. And cute little tid-bit, I'm the bread winner. I make nearly $5 more on my hourly wage. Take that info and shove it.Update: Thanks for all the awards and awesome feed back! I am in search of a (hopefully) light weight mask that one of you suggested. I hope it works!"
336,Not the A-hole,AITA for not wanting my parents to adopt another teenage girl,23676,gf4knq,2358,"I (15F) live with my parents (mid-40s) and my brother (9M). It’s always been a dream of my parents to adopt (me and bro are bio-kids) and they had come to the decision that they want to adopt an older kid. They got matched with ‘Jess’ who is 13. Due to the current situation, she is not living with us, but we’ve met before and she’s spent a weekend with us in January. Jess, despite sometimes being sweet and kind, is very high maintenance and has a lot of anxiety and anger problems. She can go from 0-1000 really quick. During her stay, she got triggered by something when we were in public (she and I went to a clothes shop and my parents were in a cafe nearby - some guy accidentally grabbed her by her shoulder as he thought she was his daughter, and he apologised immediately) and started screaming. I was the only person there, and I tried to calm her down but she ran off.She was found (shaken, but safe) an hour later. I then got grounded as I had failed in being responsible for my ‘sister.’ I said I didn’t have a sister. My parents were angry about this and said that how dare I be rude about her, don’t I know how much she’s been through. She’s had other outbursts, but none so huge in public. She can be cold and untrusting and was very clingy to my parents. I do admire her, and think she’s very brave - but I don’t want to live with her.My parents call Jess often. I often say hi, and try to be civil and supportive. But it seems like the only thing my parents can talk about is Jess, and how brave she is, and she isn’t even here yet.We live in a 3 bedroom house, and my parents promised to move to a bigger one later this year. Recently, my parents broke the news to me that Jess will move into my room, and I can pick whether I want to share a room with bro, or Jess. I don’t want to share with either. My brother is messy, loud and is your average 9yo boy and Jess has night terrors and screams the house down, and it’s enough having to open my house to her, but I value my privacy a lot and don’t want her in my room, which is like my special place. I was crushed. I asked if we were still moving, and my parents were like, ‘We like this place and have no solid plan.’ I freaked out and was like, ‘You guys are forgetting you have another daughter and are too excited about the shiny new one to remember that the one you have has feelings and boundaries, and if you’re changing everything I’ve ever known, at least I deserve to be listened to. If this is how life’s going to be, I don’t want to have a sister.’Good to note: my room is big enough to have a wall put in, and my parents considered it a few years back. I would be happy with that. They refuse, even though we can easily afford it, because it is ‘too much effort.’My parents are offended that I’m ‘not being welcoming’ towards my ‘sister’, and I’m offended that the life I knew is going to be turned upside down, and I’m not going to have the thing I value most, my privacy. AITA?Update: this blew up... enough to reach jess. she called me and we had a good heart to heart. she was unaware of the situation, and felt really uncomfortable about it. we had a family meeting via skype to explain to my parents why this was a bad idea, and showed them some of the comments in this thread. they apologised and they said they would try to improve their behaviour. we asked to put up a wall, and they agreed. my father is currently watching a video on how to do it lol.jess also says hi to everyone - and thanks you for looking out for her."
337,Not the A-hole,AITA For telling a stranger to delete a picture of me and my seizure alert dog that he took of me on the bus even after he told me why?,23635,e015on,2940,"Heya. So this happened a few days ago, and I'm still pretty worried about whether I'm an asshole or not. I take the bus to and from work and it's quite a long commute. Background:  I have epilepsy. I have a seizure alert dog, and he comes with me on the bus. Because hes trained to do all kinds of support tasks, hes a large breed dog (sheepdog/poodle cross). Ive had a lot of seizures on the bus, so I have a hard time mentally dealing with the commute every day. To accommodate his size and to make me comfortable, I sit in the disability seating section if it's available so he can lay beneath/between my legs and out of the way. Now onto the story: I'm on the bus ride home, and I found a seat in the disability section. I was about 2 stops from my home, and  I was starting to have a few auras, so my dog turned around and was facing me/alerting me. The next thing I know, I see a flash. I look up, and a man sitting near me was holding up his phone and taking a picture of me. I was in a bit of a rough state, so I asked him to delete it. I was probably firmer than I usually would be, but my dog was alerting me and I had about 10-15 mins to get home. The man was stuttering and saying things like ""I just wanted a picture he was being so cute and I saw his ID badge (he has one attached to his vest that says ""seizure alert dog"")."" I asked him again to delete the pic and then he goes ""my daughter has epilepsy and it would be important to her to see a working seizure alert dog"" I told him there were plenty of resources online and made him show me that he deleted it. I was then at my stop and ran home.I felt bad, because I do epilepsy activism work so I felt for him but I was really uncomfortable with someone taking a picture of me while my seizure alert dog in the disability section just felt wrong. Should I have just let him keep the picture? AITA?Edit to clear up some things: -I dont care about legality, just the asshole nature of the situation-I'm a female :) -I live in Canada-While I dont have exclusive photosensitive epilepsy, flashing lights make my auras worse -If he had asked me, I would have gotten out of the way and let him take a picture of my dog. Hes super cute so I get it.Edit: I didnt know about the dog tax! Attached: [The headshot my work took for our HR Directory! ]("
338,Not the A-hole,AITA for not telling people my missing cousin is staying with me right away?,23638,kazgfw,1488,"It is the middle of the night, and my phone won't stop ringing because of my family.To try and keep this short, my cousin ""Jake"" got outed about 4 or five days before his 18th birthday in the summer. His parents, my aunt and uncle, made arrangements for him to be sent to one of those awful camps that claim they could ""cure"" him. A kid in his community was forced to go and came back and was clearly not well, so Jake didn't want to go.Jake ran away from home, and jumped from one family house to another. His folks didn't file a missing person report because they didn't want to look bad to their neighbors. They just told them that he went to that camp willingly.He dissapeared in the middle of october, and turned up in my city a week later. After making sure he was safe to bring home, my wife and I allowed him to stay. He didn't want me to tell the rest of the family for a while, because those people at the camp keep showing up to take him.I made sure to talk to a lawyer, who assured Jake that they cannot take him. Three days ago, he told his parents he was here. A few hours later, those damn camp people showed up, but they were unable to take him.My family has been blowing up my phone for the last two days angry that I didn't tell someone sooner. Well, jake didn't feel safe yet, and still doesn't. I wanted to make sure he was ready.Still, even those that want to protect Jake is upset with me for hiding him.AITA for not telling anyone that he is here until he was ready?EDIT:  Wow, thank you all for the awards. I don't deserve them but thanks. Since I am drinking coffee and slowly going through the comments I thought I should say a few things.First off, while I figured I wasn't the AH for hiding him from my more narrow minded family, it was those that really wanted to help jake that made me feel guilty. They were all scared out of their minds and wanted the peace to know he was ok. I felt bad for not telling them. Though i am sure they wouldn't had turned him in, I felt bad because we were working on keeping him safe.Also,  we got a lawyer who got the police on the look out for those camp people in case they try anything. Jake is not going out alone until we are sure he is safe.Third, we are looking on how to get his paper work, like his birth certificate, here because no way he trusts his parents to just hand them over. My granny in law is talking to some people that could help.Fourth, Jake says hello and thank you.Oh and we're Catholic, not Christian. We're our own special type of jacka$$es.EDIT Once again: ok you're right about the Catholic/Christian thing. I was raised to split hairs, I apologize."
339,Not the A-hole,AITA for informing my uncle that he is responsible for his daughter's gender and not his wife?,23557,ig9upr,1784,"My uncle Jesse, aunt Lola and cousin Poppy(F, 6) visited us today. It had been Poppy's birthday last week and we hadn't been able to visit them to wish her, so we gave her the gifts we had bought for her. My parents bought her a doll house and some clothes and I bought her a remote controlled car and some toy binoculars. Aunt Lola and Poppy was very happy and accepted the gifts but my uncle looked annoyed when he saw what I'd bought for Poppy.I asked him if something was wrong and he asked me why I bought ""boys toys"" for his daughter when she was a girl. I asked him if he is saying only boys can play with remote controlled cars and binoculars and he said yes. He asked me why I didn't buy her a doll or a kitchen set or something more feminine. I stared at him incredulously and told him that anyone can play with these and toys aren't gendered, but he kept insisting they are and started to get angry.My mom told me to let it go but I found it ridiculous that he was already restricting his daughter's choices at such a young age and forcing her to be ""feminine"".Uncle Jesse then said ""If I had had a son, then these gifts would be acceptable. Unfortunately it is Lola's fault that she gave me a daughter, so don't give Poppy such masculine gifts.""I knew my uncle wasn't very educated but this was the dumbest thing I had ever heard someone say. I informed him that it was his sperm that decided Poppy would be a girl, it isn't Lola's fault at all. That Lola has XX chromosomes and he had XY chromosomes and I basically went on a rant explaining how everything works. He was extremely angry after this and told me to stop lying and to shut up. He picked up Poppy and told Lola that they're leaving, they took only the gifts my parents brought and asked my parents to ""teach this idiot manners"". My dad yelled at him for saying this and my mom didn't say much to them but told me I had stepped out of line. That I should have just stayed silent and ignored what he had said. She said I was extremely rude. AITA?"
340,Not the A-hole,AITA for yelling at my dad(51M) and calling him a monster for what he gave my sister(30F) as a Christmas ''gift''?,23535,kn9wvu,790,"My(28F) sister Amanda(30F) never met her bio-mom. My dad(51M) raised her alone until she was barely 1, my dad and my mom got married in 1992.Amanda knew that my mom wasn't her bio-mother, she started pressuring my dad for information on her mom when she was around 17, my dad always gave her vague answers and refused to talk about her bio mom, which put a strain on their relationship.Enters our uncle (49M) and revealed the ''family secret'', apparently, Amy's mom wanted an abortion (she was 19), but my dad and his parents were able to ''bribe'' her, they offered her money if she followed up with the pregnancy, and she accepted, my grandparents sold one of their houses and gave her half of that money to Amy's mom when the pregnancy was viable, and the other half she received when she waived her parental rights over Amy to let my mom adopt her when she was 4.My uncle wasn't supposed to tell her that, my grandparents were furious. Amy stopped her crusade to met her bio-mom and her relationship with my dad went back to normal, Amy never mentioned her bio-mom again, dad got her into therapy after that. A month ago, Amy found out that she was pregnant, the pregnancy was an accident, she switched birth controls. The problem being, Amy is about to start her surgical residency and her hours are insane, it is basically impossible to raise a baby while working in that rhythm, so she wanted an abortion, the problem is that Mark(35M) her fiancé (6 years together) wanted her to keep the baby, it caused a big fight.In a dick move to convince Amy to keep the baby, Mark told dad about this (until that point no one in our family knew about this), dad talked with her and they got into an enormous fight. Amy went got the abortion 10 days ago, Mark ended up breaking up with her, she is obviously really sad.My dad was acting like a jerk, he was pretending that Amy didn't exist, he didn't want to talk or see her.So on Christmas day, we were exchanging gifts, when everyone had already finished giving each other gifts dad got up and gave Amy her ''present'', he gave her an envelope in front of everyone and told her to open it.It was 3 pictures with something written on the back, a name, an address, and a phone number.Dad told her that he was tired of ''babying'' her, that this is a photo of her bio-mom and her two sons, that was her bio-mom address, and that he contacted her bio-mom and she is willing to speak with Amy, he gave her Amy's number, dad thinks that they will have ''a great relationship since they are so similar''.Amy broke down crying, I ended up in a fight with dad, called him a monster for doing that to her, he just said he ''was just tired'' and left, we ended up leaving and she spent the rest of Christmas crying on my shoulder, she is a mess since that.My younger brothers called me a grinch for making a scene and ruining Christmas, my mom was silent during the whole thing.My parents have been giving me the cold shoulder since Christmas.AITA here?edit: Amy is short for Amanda."
341,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my girlfriend that her phobia is ridiculous and she needs treatment?,23536,ea4hnu,2898,"My (20) girlfriend (21) has a very severe phobia of cold things. We live in England, so this is an issue for like, half of the year. She refuses to touch anything that might be cold, including the floor with her feet in winter, door handles, walls, cold water, absolutely anything. She has to run a full bath of very hot water before she has a shower to 'make sure the floor isn't cold'. She also will not eat cold food or drink cold drinks at any time of year. This means that she drinks almost entirely tea and coffee (with the occasional hot juice), meaning she's always anxious because of the sheer volume of caffiene she takes in.It's winter in the UK right now, so her phobia is in full swing. It's getting ridiculous to see her refusing to do literally anything because she might have to touch something cold. On Thursday, she left her slipper boots on the other side of the bedroom (she had socks on, but took them off when she got in bed) so she called in sick to work and stayed in bed all day. When I got back from work, (I work 8-4, she woke up at about 11, so she waited about 5 and a half hours) she was desperate for the toilet, really hungry, and distressed. Why didn't she call someone to help her? Her phone was on the window ledge so it would be cold. I told her that her this situation is ""ridiculous"", and she needs to ""get some therapy"" because she can't live like this, and it's really impractical for her to literally not go to work because of this. It's super annoying and I don't know how she intends to get through life like this.She was extremely upset and told me that I'm an asshole for not taking her seriously, she said she realises this is ridiculous but she can't help it. I told her she could help it if she tried to get some help. Just to add, she is okay going outside in the cold air, but as usual won't touch anything cold."

My daughter only uses the smaller one. Since it's always available unlike the main bathroom that me, my stepson and wife often use.I've recently received some money and decided to renovate the small bathroom that my daughter uses since she complained about things needing to be fixed. I started the renovation 2 days ago. While my daughter uses the main bathroom as an alternative. There were no issues until my wife pulled me aside saying my daughter's been leaving period products inside the bathroom and it wasn't right cause my stepson would see them. I asked my wife for more clarification and turns out my daughter gets rid of her used pads by putting them in the trashcan inside the bathroom. I told my wife there was nothing wrong with that so what's the problem. She gave me a look. Called me an ignorant then dropped it.This morning she looked upset and told me my stepson went inside the bathroom after my daughter got out and probably saw her used pads in the bathroom. I asked if she meant the trashcan and it was confirmed. She then proceeded to tell me to ask my daughter to stop using the main bathroom even though the small one is still in the process of being renovated. I absolutely lost my shit and told her she was making a ridiculously unreasonable demand. Told her it's my daughter's house too. Where is she supposed to go if she can't use both bathrooms?. We started arguing back and forth until she said she'd talk to her but I told her to stop it. She just kept giving me the cold shoulder for hours now even though my stepson said nothing about this ""issue"" as she claims it to be.My wife said she was trying to be a parent but I treat her as an outsider to my daughter. That's not true. I might've been harsh on her but in my opinion she wasn't trying to parent she was being unreasonable. I might be wrong I just don't see her point.AMITA Here!?My wife is an incredibly private person but that doesn't mean she can get others to follow.To answer your question: The trashcan we have has a lid. It's a step on trashcan that doesn't require hands.My stepson isn't even aware of what his mom's talking about. He can barely look around he always has his phone glued to his face and he doesn't pay attention to anything."
343,Not the A-hole,AITA For Telling My Wife That If She Quits Her Job I Expect Her To Cover All The Housework?,23465,cyj5v1,3780,"My wife wants to quit her job. She wants to be a SAHM to spend more time on with 4 year old daughter and stop leaving her at daycare centres.In order for her to do that, I would have to sign for a higher paying job schedule, about 2 hours more per day and occasionally half day on Saturdays. I told her that I if she quits her job then I expect her to cover all the housework. I may not be splitting the chores with her, since having longer working hours is rather tiring. I will will help out on weekends but during weekdays I rather rest. My wife then told me she that is not a housekeeper and I am being lazy and discriminative against women. I don't really mean that, as I think it is fair that if she stops contributing to our household income she can handle all the housework. I will also become the sole breadwinner and work extra hard to support the family. AITA?Edit: I admit that I did not really used a nice tone while talking to my wife because I was was having conflicted thoughts on either supporting her choice or trying to talk her out of it. Our household income isn't that high to begin with and it will be difficult to be the only provider. Ofcourse, I also think that my wife has every right to want to spend more time with our daughter and it would be good for both of them."
344,Not the A-hole,AITA for only going out to eat with my uncle after the rest of my family disagreed with my restaurant choice?,23433,gyip6p,1262,"I (F21) am currently living with my uncle and his family while I attend university. In my family it's tradition for everyone to invite out their family for their birthday. The person celebrating their birthday pays.My birthday was yesterday and luckily restaurants here have already opened up. About a week in advance I chose a Moroccan couscous restaurant and made a reservation. I briefly mentioned it to the rest of the family at dinner but I don't think most of them were listening.Two days ago I reminded everybody where we were going. Everybody except for my uncle started to complain about the choice. My extremely picky cousin (17) apparently hates Moroccan food, even though I don't think he's ever tried it. My aunt is uncomfortable with going to ""that kind"" of restaurant (?). My other cousin (26) is a vegan and didn't think he would be able to eat a lot of things, and his girlfriend didn't want to eat there because she's on a raw food diet. My other cousin is apparently on a diet  and didn't want to go somewhere where she could get a salad.It didn't really bother me that they disagreed with my choice, but what bothered me was that they hadn't even tried the food or looked at the menu, but already didn't want to go. They asked me to change my choice and instead that we could go to a nearby restaurant that they go to every week and that I don't really like. I refused and said they just didn't have to come.Only my uncle came with me when we went to the restaurant yesterday, which I'm happy about because I know the rest of the family would have done nothing but complain. It was delicious and it was nice eating with an actually adventurous person for once. Now the rest of the family is angry at us because birthday meals usually include the whole family, and they think it's inconsiderate of us to have eaten without them. I think it's their fault for not even wanting to try it. AITA?Edit: Thank you everyone for your judgements. I saw a lot of people confused about paying when it's your birthday. Where I'm from it's the custom, not just in my family but everywhere. I think it's a nice custom. That way no guest worries about not being able to pay, and it's nice to be able to pay for family and friends to have a nice meal."
345,Not the A-hole,AITA for telling my brother in law that paternity tests aren't automatic,23429,gdr20t,1868,"UPDATE: wow this got a lot of comments!!!So I have done a LOT of snooping. And it is way more soap opera than I thought.1) apparently since child 1 didn't look like him at all, she made up the paternity test scheme to trick him into marrying her. But, THEY ACTUALLY DID PATERNITY TEST THAT KID and the real test said her ex was the dad. But he refused so she lied about the result, and my bfs bro never asked to see the papers2) it gets worse. She's been secretly collecting child support from bio dad, and using it as get secret slush fund, while being a stay at home mom and making husband pay her way3) she cheated on him A LOT and figured that she could lie again if the kids weren't his, and secretly rake in the child support. So, each baby she had tested, but the next two were his.4) he decided to stay bc the kids - but he called the baby daddy of Kid 1 and explained the whole situation.5) Baby Daddy of kid 1 is in negotiations for visitation or to cease child support.ORIGINAL POSTA while back I started buying a house w my boyfriend. We decided to let his brother and his brother's wife and kids live with us.The wife and I each got pregnant within a few months of each other, and so the house was totally wrapped up in baby preparations.Well, when it's her turn to give birth, he gets back with her and he's all aglow and happy saying how much the new baby looks like him, and he says ""I couldn't deny her [the baby] if I tried even without the paternity test!""I thought this was a weird thing to say. As far as I knew, their relationship was good, so I didn't see why they would do a test.The first time he said it I let it go, but he said it a few times to a few family friends and it really started to bother me. Especially that everyone just took it in stride.Finally, when everyone was gone various places, I asked what he meant by that. I was like ""you keep talking about a paternity test what's that about"" and he said it was ""the one they do when a baby gets born, at the hospital"" and I asked what he meant and he got frustrated and said ""you know the one they always do at the hospital when a baby gets born, like you guys when yours was born, so they can put it on the birth certificate.""The confused me even more. I explained to him we didn't have one done, that we filled out the birth certificate paperwork beforehand, and all they did was ask my bf if he was the dad and he said yeah so they marked it down.He got really quiet, and it kinda clicked for me that something was up, so I said ""maybe it's because I have different insurance"" because that's all I could think of.Well he shut himself in his room, and when his wife got back they had a huge fight, and it turns out she's been cheating on him for like six years. Everyone is upset with me for telling him, because it ruined their happiness about their new baby. Am I the asshole?"
346,Not the A-hole,AITA For not switching places with my friend and ruining her life,23417,l5gpw6,2116,"This happened a couple weeks ago but I'm still getting shit about it.A friend of mine Daya (fake name) asked me if I wanted to come with her on some errands and see her new car. I said yes because I had some things to get done and my car was being checked over. (We're in the same bubble and stayed masked the whole time)Well while we were out Daya ended up hitting another car while turning left. We were both shaken but mostly fine yet but when I started to call the police Daya started freaking out even more. She started begging me not to call the cops and to just go talk to the other driver. I didn't feel comfortable not calling them so I went ahead and did. Then Daya started begging me to get in the driver's seat, saying I had to get in the driver's seat, I had to claim I was the one driving. Turns out Daya doesn't have a license. She needed/wanted a car but didn't feel like getting her license so her mom bought the car for her.I didn't feel comfortable lying to the police so I continued to refuse and just got out of the car and waited on the sidewalk for them to get there. Well Daya got arrested for driving without a license, insurance, or registration for her car and just told me today she has been found at fault for the accident.Now Daya, her mom, and half of our friends are saying I'm an asshole for not just switching places. She is now facing multiple fines, possible jail time, and being kicked out of our MA program because of all this. I tried to explain that I didn't feel comfortable lying to the police but she just keeps calling me a ""privileged bitch"" and wishing horrible things would happen to me.So am I the asshole for not switching places with her?Edit: Several people have said I should include this and I'm sorry I didn't in the original post. This was much more serious than a fender bender. This was my response to someone else: ""She took the entire front of his car off or at least it looked like it. We were at an intersection and she was in a left turn lane with a yellow light and didn't look before she went. The other gentleman was coming the opposite way going straight. Both cars are totaled."" The gentleman was not unconscious as I originally thought but he did hit his head on the steering wheel and he had to be taken to the hospital. He did eventually get out of his car with help and that's when I believe I should have talked to him. Daya and I were mostly alright with just some bumps and bruises.Edit 2: Someone suggested I add this because of people saying I am the asshole for calling the police but for major accident such as this one where I live you are required by law to call the police and file a report."
347,Not the A-hole,AITA for emasculating my BF?,23398,glilwo,2197,"I (30F) met this guy (28M) in January and he became my BF in February. Comes March, the world goes down the drain and we decided to move in together for the time of the pandemic. Everything is great.In the morning, we have this routine where he browses Reddit and gives me the highlights. A few weeks ago, he shows me a post where this guy is challenged to an arm wrestling competition by his GF. The guy didn't seem to have any sort of training/work out whereas his GF did.I commented he might have a surprise. My BF started educating me on biology and how men are stronger than women. I told him there were way too many factors to take into consideration to make such a broad comment. I have been doing weightlifting for 2 years and my BF has never seen a gym in his life, so I used us as an example. That was a BIG mistake.He got really defensive and condescending, and made comments like ""That's cute."" I just let it go.Fast forward to yesterday. He's playing some game with his friend (online) and I can clearly hear him talk about me. Well curiosity killed the cat. At first it's all pretty and my ego is bursting, but then he says I'm delusional because I think I'm stronger than him. Pause. ""Seriously? I know I'm weak but not weaker than a girl."" So later, I decide to call him on his BS. I asked him if he wanted to come workout with me the next day (this morning) so he can show me how strong he is. He accepted and I was happy because I had been dying to bring him and initiate him to something I'm passionate about. So, this morning, we went to my friend's (27M) garage (my region allows groups of 10 or less and we wipe everything). I told him we're gonna do deadlifts. It's my favorite exercise and I was already planning to test my personal best so it was perfect.My friend was there cause he corrects my form and it's been our Sunday ritual since Covid-19. We started light and slowly worked our way up, doing the same number of reps as the other. Comes 185, his form starts to crumble so we made him go lighter. But 185 really isn't that much for me so I kept stacking the plates. He looked very supportive and impressed the whole time. I ended up beating my personal best at 265. I was ecstatic and so were they.When we got in the car, he was very silent. I assumed he was just tired. We got home and that's when he exploded and asked me if I was proud of myself. Apparently, I humiliated him in front of my friend. I apologized. I didnt realize he was feeling that way. He got angry and said it really changed the way he saw me, like I'm less of a woman now. He stormed to the basement. I started collecting my things, but now I'm wondering if I should have been reading between the lines and stopped at 190 or something. Or just dropped it and never suggested we workout together? I knew very well I was stronger than him but I just had to prove it to him. AITA?Update: I still didnt get a word of him but since some of you asked, I will make sure to update you when he does. Thank you for the overwhelming response. That was a bit of a rollercoaster day but it made it easier to know I'm not completely in the wrong."
348,Not the A-hole,AITA for correcting every single sentence spoken by my boyfriend’s aunt in front of everyone?,23363,dv4je8,1989,"I know the title looks pretty bad but hear me out! I’m a native French speaker from Canada, but I have a very pronounced “Acadian/Chiac” accent. For those who don’t know, it’s pretty much a mix of French and English with some local dialect thrown in there. Pretty common in the maritimes, where I still live. I’m perfectly bilingual in both languages.I started dating my boyfriend, who only speaks English, about 4 years ago and spend a lot of time with his family, they’ve all been really great, except for one of his aunts. She says she was a French teacher in anglophone schools for over 40 years up until a year ago and even studied in France, and she INSISTS on only talking to me in French. I agreed at first since I didn’t want to be rude to his family but it’s getting super weird. I don’t understand how she was able to teach kids English or how she comes up with most of her sentence, like I have to guess 90% of whatever she says and hope I’m right because it makes absolutely no sense. (Example: she said “a la citrouille la tarte va bien dans ma bouche” which roughly translates to “to the pumpkin a pie goes well in my mouth” when she meant “this pumpkin pie tastes delicious”) She constantly criticizes my “accent”.  and tries to correct my pronunciation of certain words, and tells me I need to “pick a language” when I accidentally say something in chiac (speaking proper “français standard” is actually getting harder for me since I’ve been only studying/working in English). So last night during dinner she started going on about how Acadians were uneducated and made no effort to properly learn a language, which is total BS, and obviously weirdly directed at me. For the rest of the night I stopped guessing what she was trying to say to me in french, acting like I didn’t understand anything, and started correcting her as well - which was pretty much every single sentence she said. I wasn’t trying to be rude or aggressive about it but after a while she gave up on the French and ignored me for the rest of the night.  Turns out she was super pissed and told everyone I was trying to embarrass her in front of everyone. Looking back I think I might’ve taken it too far by not stopping after 2-3 sentences and I feel bad. My boyfriend said I was being bitchy while his mom said she probably deserved it. AITA here?EDIT: Forgot to mention that I told her a few years ago that it’s hard for me to fully speak proper French as I spoke chiac all my life, tried to explain Acadian culture (she wasn’t having it, surprise) and she stopped for a while but is now doing it again."
349,Not the A-hole,AITA: For uninviting my sister to my wedding for what she told my fiancèe?,23357,kspqdi,2296,"My M27 fiancèe F25 has an obvious permanent burnscar from an accident that caused her mother (her only parent) to pass away from injury. My fiancèe had a long recovery it's been 7 years. The scar is on her collarbone. it goes down her chest but isn't showing. Unless she's wearing scoop/square tops. She often wears hoodies/jackets to cover up. She puts this cream I don't know what ladies call it but it's supposed to tone skin color or something? I'm not sure but my fiancèe calls it foundation that is one degree brighter than her skin color. I absolutely adore her she's pretty, smart, ambitious and the list goes on. What happened was unfortunate and I'm glad she's at peace with herself and more confident.My family love her. How can they not. She's a member of the family. My mom makes sure she takes part in every family function and things like shopping and decorating other things. However. My sister made comments about my fiancèe's scar several times. I've called her out on her behavior several times to get her to stop because she was hurting me before my fiancèe with her backhanded and insensitivecomments. I told my fiancèe she had everyright to cut my sister out and not deal with her bullshit but she has been forgiving and respectful of my entire family.Our wedding is in February. My fiancèe went shopping for the wedding dress. This is where the issue started:My fiancèe showed the wedding dress to my sister. I didn't see it but I was told it was a spaghetti strap dress. My fiancèe likes this stuff. Anyways my sister saw it and went nuts she started criticising her choice and said that she should've gotten a high nick or a jewel wedding dress to cover up the scar. She argued with my fiancèe about it. I went to my family's house and I confronted her. I yelled at her after she told me my fiancee needed to return the dress and get a ""proper"" one so that guests won't focus on her burnscar and use it as the topic of conversation and gossip. I told her that she's not invited to our wedding. She isn't welcome to my wedding with this entitled attitude of hers and her insensitivity and disrespect. We argued for half an hour then I left.In exactly an hour. My mom and dad called and berated me saying my sister was crying after I uninvited her and that I had no right to univinte her. She's my sister and was just trying to help out and give an advice and avoid any ""unnecessary"" drama at the wedding. My mom said my fiancèe can keep the dress but suggested to wear a pridel shawl as a neutral solution. I stopped responding to my mom's calls and texts after that. Family members were upset my sister was uninvited and wanted me to invite her again because this will make family look bad in front of outsiders and guests."
350,Not the A-hole,AITA for evicting a tenant because they got pregnant?,23354,ikg117,2749,"Yes, I know the title sounds awful, but please do hear me out before making a judgement. I will accept whatever judgement I’m given.I (30m) purchased a 3 bedroom condo in Toronto, Canada 5 years ago when I was in my second year of medical residency. Soon after the purchase, I rented one of the rooms to my roommate (f29) to offset the costs of the mortgage. I live in one room, she lives in the second, and the third is my study/office. She has been a great roommate from the beginning. We aren’t necessarily friends (as in we don’t do things together for fun), but we get along exceptionally well.The entire roommate/tenant relationship has gone swimmingly up until recently. A couple of weeks ago, my roommate broke the news to me that she is pregnant. The father was a fling of hers, who does not want anything to do with the child. My roommate has decided she wants to keep the child anyways, and raise it on her own. To me that seems like a huge challenge, and I admire her for it.The issue is, while I don’t necessarily dislike children, I have no desire to live with a baby. While the condo is a fair size, I will most definitely be woken up by the babies crying at night. My condo is also where I like to come home to and relax, like a haven after a long work day, and the idea of coming home to a baby honestly seems absolutely chaotic. Especially since this isn’t my own child (ie one that my girlfriend and I decided to have/was mentally prepared for).As difficult as it was for me to do this, I told my her essentially what I’ve written here, and that it would be best if she finds somewhere else to live. I am not rushing her out or anything like that, I have given her 6 month’s notice, since any later than that will come too close to the birth. She was honestly quite taken aback by this, and thought that I was being cruel. Her primary concern is that rent has gone up substantially in this city since she signed on with me (I haven’t increased her rent since she moved in, so she’s essentially paying 2015 rent). She works as a waitress, and will likely need to find a lesser apartment to keep within the same budget. A couple of other considerations are that she was out of work while restaurants were closed, but I did waive her rent for that period. All of the furniture is also mine (aside from her bedroom), so she would need to figure something out on that front as well, aside from all of the child expenses. I understand her position, and I feel horrible about the situation, but I honestly can’t do it. AITA for this?Edit: Thank you to everyone who has commented. There have been two great suggestions on how I can make this situation better, which I have taken to heart. I haven't been able to give life much thought lately, as work has been quite busy. Firstly, I have a friend in real estate, and I'm going to see if they can help her try to find some affordable listings. Secondly - as I don't plan to take on another tenant after her, and can afford to do this anyway - I have decided I'm going to waive her rent for the remainder of the tenancy. This will hopefully give her a bit of a boost to get on her feet.Edit 2: I'm just checking on this for the first time today. My god, I was not expecting anywhere near this many replies. Thank you to everyone who has commented. I am about to head into surgery, but I will do my best to get back to as many people as I can later today.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Edit 3/update:  I am honestly overwhelmed by the amount of attention this has gotten. Thank you everyone that commented, regardless of your opinion. I was planning to reply to as many posts as possible, but honestly seeing as there are over 2000 comments, I think I will have to just address some common questions here. I also have an update on the situation, and I wish everyone that's commented so far could receive notification to read it.So firstly: To anyone asking about the legality of the matter, I consulted an attorney to be 1000% sure, and this is perfectly legal. Since I live in the unit, the eviction laws are much more lenient.Secondly: To anyone that said I should allow her to live with me anyway, I challenge you to consider what the alternative would be. If this doesn't happen now, then when? Her baby will become a toddler, and a toddler eventually becomes a school age child. Will it really be any better to do this later on? Or do you suggest that I let her raise the child here until they are 18?**Finally, the update:** When I came home from work today, I told her that I wanted to discuss the overall situation. Before I even began, she actually apologized to me for how she spoke to me, and for expecting that I would be okay for her to raise her child here. I told her that her apology is totally unnecessary, as her reaction was completely understandable considering the uncertainty of her future. I then told her that what I told all of you; that I would waive her rent for the remainder of her stay to help her get on her feet. She pushed back on this at first, but after I urged her to think of her child, she graciously accepted. Aside from this, I also told her about my friend who could help her out with finding some affordable listings in the area. I thought I might be overstepping there, but she was actually extremely thankful and said she would take me up on there.Finally, I want to thank u/tuttipeachyfrutti for probably the best piece of advice that I've read (I'm sure there are many more people that I should be thanking, but I honestly don't think I'll be able to read everything here). This was that I could help her obtain a more reliable work position at my hospital, nothing fancy as she doesn't have any schooling, but it will be much more secure than waitressing (and once you're in, there's always ways to work your way up). There would also be benefits/maternity leave that I don't think restaurants usually offer. This was probably my biggest risk of overstepping, but when I mentioned the idea to her she was actually over the moon (tears were shed...). I do agree that I acted in self interest here, so I think it's the least I can do to make sure this soon to be mother and her child have some sense of security in their lives. Thank you again to everyone.**\*\*\*This isn't an edit, but more of a request. Does anyone here know if it's possible to change your title to include something like ""updated"". I really want everyone that commented to know that they all made a huge impact on a new mothers life. I can't thank you enough, very glad that I made this post.** &#x200B;"
